Discussion Name: Was Donald Trump a Good President?

1. Donald Trump was a good president.
1.1. Pro: The success of President Trump's policies meant that he was one of the best presidents.
1.1.1. Pro: President Trump reformed all aspects of the US's immigration system, reducing both legal and illegal immigration.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Illegal immigration, which is a [huge drain](https://cis.org/Report/Costs-Immigration)(- County of Los Angeles, Chief Administrative Officer. Report on the Fiscal Costs of Illegal Aliens in Los Angeles County. 1991.\n\nThis report assessed taxes paid to the county by an estimated 770,000 illegal aliens and their service and assistance costs to the county. It found county revenues of $137.6 million and county outlays of $413.8 million, for a deficit for illegals of $276.2 million in FY'91.\n\n- State of Texas, Governor's Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs \(GOIRA\). Estimates of the Undocumented Population. 1993.\n\nGOIRA estimated there were 550,000 illegal aliens in Texas in 1992. They paid $290 million in state and local taxes and generated state and local service and assistance costs of $456 million, for a deficit of $166 million. Applying the lower estimate of the Immigration and Naturalization Service \(INS\) of 350,000 illegal aliens in Texas, GOlRA estimated total costs and revenues at $313 million and $183 million respectively, for a deficit of $130 million.) on the United State's welfare state, was addressed by the Trump administration.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: President Trump planned to [introduce](https://time.com/5590730/trump-immigration-plan-congress/)(Drafted by top advisers Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, the proposal outlines an immigration system that focuses mostly on those with specific professional skills and education, replacing decades-old laws favoring relatives of other immigrants.\n\n“It would be a big departure from our current system,” says Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell University. “Right now two-thirds of all immigrants who are admitted are based on some kind of family characteristic.”) a new merit-based system for legal immigration to the United States, where those who could positively contribute to the economy would be given visas.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: President Trump called for an overhaul of the immigration system to make it [merit-based](https://www.us-immigration.com/blog/trumps-raise-act-proposes-merit-based-immigration-system/)(What is a merit-based green card system?\n\nA merit-based green card system uses a point system to determine who can immigrate to and live in a country. Many countries award points based on job, career or language skills. Most merit-based systems focus on strengthening the host country’s economy.\n\nAlong that line, in February of 2017, U.S. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue introduced the RAISE Act, Senate Bill 354. RAISE is an acronym that stands for Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment. It is part of a larger plan to make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based.) rather than lottery-based.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The primary effect of this policy will be more competition for well-paying jobs, likely with lower wages as a result.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There will be many effects, and the above claim is a gross simplification. The policy will bring much-needed skills into the country which will boost wealth for everyone in the long run. It will also increase wages for low skilled jobs as employers will be less able to rely on illegal immigrants who are willing to work for less money for a variety of reasons.
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: As a candidate who is unreliable and [often](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) [lies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/12/anatomy-trump-rally-percent-claims-are-false-misleading-or-lacking-evidence/?utm_term=.3cb2328191c5), the fact the policies he's gone forward with on immigration tell much more than the policies he says he intends to go forward with.
1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Conversely, President Trump has also called for [reducing](http://fortune.com/2017/01/14/congress-h1b-immigration/) the number of H1-B visas - highly qualified people who should have a lot of merit.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Immigrants provide great economic benefit and have a negligible fiscal impact.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: A wide variety of [meta-analyses and studies](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-21-fix.pdf) have never demonstrated that immigration has ever presented an undue burden on state or government budgets.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: It is widely accepted that immigrants present a [massive boon](https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2016/09/0922_immigrant-economics-full-report.pdf) to economic activity.
1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The benefits of immigrants are accepted even by fervently [anti-immigration economists](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216).
1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: All economies not only require skilled workers, but the labourers to bring these skilled workers' ambitions to fruition. If we take the argument that President Trump managed an 'economic miracle', he would have needed an increased supply of labour to facilitate this expansion.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: The vast majority of illegal immigration into the United States does not come from border-crossing, but from people [overstaying their visas](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/despite-trumps-claims-most-illegal-immigration-is-not-at-the-southern-border.html). President Trump has done a poorer job addressing this than Obama.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: The illegal immigrant population has been [steadily declining since its peak in 2007](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2018/11/27/u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-total-dips-to-lowest-level-in-a-decade/). There is no evidence that President Trump did significantly decrease it. The primary focus of President Trump's policies was to [restrict legal immigration](https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/trumps-attacks-legal-immigration-system-explained), including both legal asylum seekers and [high-skill immigrants](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/politics/trump-h1b-work-visas.html) who greatly [benefit the economy](https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/resources-reports/reports/immigration.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9IX4BRCcARIsAOD2OB1_G9Bu322Loe5zvdpReymVsPWGJaCgXdrcho0giJTwKXLVIbAhpmoaAuJiEALw_wcB) by working hard and [starting companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2018/10/25/55-of-americas-billion-dollar-startups-have-immigrant-founder/#34c2473548ee) that employ Americans.
1.1.1.2. Con: There is no evidence that illegal immigration rates have reduced since President Trump was sworn into office.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: From 2017 to 2019, there was an [increase in the number of detentions at the borders](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54638643).
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The number of unauthorized immigrants in the US started to decline [before Trump's administration](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/us-unauthorized-immigrant-population-2017/ft_19-06-12_unauthorizedimmigration_number-unauthorized-immigrants-in-us-declined_corrected/).
1.1.1.3. Con: President [Trump's immigration policies](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/trumps-war-on-migrants-is-an-affront-to-humanity/) were cruel and hurtful and did not serve the interests of compassion, diversity, and humanity.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: President Trump's immigration policies encouraged [family separation](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/07/12/453378/trumps-family-incarceration-policy-threatens-healthy-child-development/).
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: President Trump almost eliminated [asylum in the US](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-trump-administration-eliminating-asylum-us)(Under President Trump, seeking and receiving safety in the United States has become next to impossible.).
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: There have been cases of [coerced sterilization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/25/ice-is-accused-sterilizing-detainees-that-echoes-uss-long-history-forced-sterilization/) at immigration detention centers.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: Many of President Trump's immigration policies were [continuations](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17488458/obama-immigration-policy-family-separation-border) of Obama-era policies.
1.1.1.3.5. Pro: Refugee admissions into the US [fell drastically under Trump's presidency](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54638643)(The number of people admitted to the US as refugees each year is determined by a system of quotas, the size of which are ultimately defined by the president. People seeking to move to the US as refugees must make their applications from outside the country, and need to convince US officials that they are vulnerable to persecution at home.\n\nMr Trump's hostility to any immigration from Muslim-majority countries is well known - he once pledged to enact a "complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" - and a reduction in refugee quotas proved easier to implement than an outright ban, which became mired in legal challenges.\n\nAs a result, the number of refugees admitted from a number of majority-Muslim countries, including Iraq, Somalia, Iran and Syria, fell almost to zero soon after he took office.).
1.1.1.4. Pro: From 2016 to July 2020, President Trump [reduced legal immigration](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/07/21/trump-cuts-legal-immigrants-by-half-and-hes-not-done-yet/#4a6bee5c6168) by 49%.
1.1.1.5. Con: Reducing legal immigration is not aligned with American values.
1.1.2. Con: President Trump was unable to combat COVID-19 effectively.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [On February 8th, 2020, the CDC produced thousands of failed tests](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/covid-19-test-trump-admin-failed-disaster-995930/) that would have slowed the virus and allowed for tracing and fewer restrictions of who could be tested.
1.1.2.2. Pro: During Trump's presidency, the US had one of the world's [highest mortality rates](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/20/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-mortality-rate-intl/index.html)(But the President's claim is not true. And it's not even close.\n\nThe US in fact has one of the highest death rates from the coronavirus of any country, and is worse than several badly-hit countries like Brazil, Mexico and Russia, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.) from COVID-19.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: One-third of the death count came from California, [New York](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00FNoc65HLDXxvwv6CWSlxC6rTTjw%3A1600895716213&ei=5LprX6PDDMq4tQbSkqbQBQ&q=new+york+coronavirus+death+count+today&oq=new+york+coronavirus+death+count+today&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECCMQJzoGCAAQBxAeOgQIABANOggIABANEAUQHjoHCCMQsAIQJ1ClyQFYv-MBYNXnAWgCcAB4AIABUIgBowaSAQIxMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwijxfKjmYDsAhVKXM0KHVKJCVoQ4dUDCA0&uact=5), and [New Jersey](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk0057FH1ZilJvm9cY1Fnr5DOckEnow%3A1600896109339&ei=bbxrX7SOFMq4tAaN5o3YCw&q=new+jersey+coronavirus+death+count+today&oq=new+jersey+coronavirus+death+count+today&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECCMQJzoGCAAQBxAeOgcIIxCwAhAnULMjWNI0YK84aABwAHgAgAFIiAGRBZIBAjEwmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwj0-KzfmoDsAhVKHM0KHQ1zA7sQ4dUDCA0&uact=5). President Trump didn't control anything in these federated, Democrat-run cities. This was scape-goating and indicated that the Democrats were unable to handle a health crisis.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The U.S. had the highest COVID-19 death rate recorded in high-income countries and led the world in the number of total pandemic deaths with [214,776](https://www.emsworld.com/news/1225033/us-has-highest-covid-19-death-rate-developed-world). \(October 2020\).
1.1.2.3. Con: It was on everyone to not spread the virus - the president and government did their job by providing information.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: [The Trump administration closed testing centers in communities where cases were spiking.](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/24/883154244/trump-administration-moving-to-close-federally-funded-covid-testing-sites)
1.1.2.3.2. Con: President Trump [admitted](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54094559) that he downplayed the seriousness of the virus from the start. He should have been more upfront about it and taken proper measures.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Since late February 2020](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/trump-coronavirus-disappear/index.html), President Trump insisted the virus would magically disappear.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: Other [world leaders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-02/three-leaders-downplayed-covid-and-ended-up-catching-it) also downplayed the virus from the start.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: [88% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/05/12/most-americans-say-federal-government-has-primary-responsibility-for-covid-19-testing/) said in May 2020 that hospitals, health officials, and local officials did well responding to COVID-19.
1.1.2.3.4. Con: Some of the information provided by president Trump was dangerously inaccurate.
1.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: President Trump incorrectly suggested that [injecting patients with disinfectant might help treat COVID-19](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52407177)(US President Donald Trump has been lambasted by the medical community after suggesting research into whether coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body.\n\nHe also appeared to propose irradiating patients' bodies with UV light, an idea dismissed by a doctor at the briefing.\n\nAnother of his officials had moments earlier said sunlight and disinfectant were known to kill the infection.\n\nDisinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested.\n\nEven external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system.).
1.1.2.4. Con: President Trump's [COVID-19 plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/) is echoed in [Joe Biden's plan](https://joebiden.com/covid19/#).
1.1.2.5. Con: President Trump [closed down the US](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51846923) almost immediately when COVID-19 was announced by the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19).
1.1.2.5.1. Con: The US wasn't the only country to close down, as many other countries also imposed [travel restrictions and bans](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html).
1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: President Trump's travel ban restrictions [came too late](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-cdc-latest-trump-travel-ban-where-covid-come-from-europe-a9623721.html) compared to other [European restrictions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51892477).
1.1.2.5.1.2. Con: President Trump reacted efficiently as he imposed the measures on the [same day that the World Health Organization](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/trump-europe-travel-ban/)(WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday said the United States would suspend travel from Europe for 30 days, a dramatic escalation of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe measures come the same day that the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. Already, U.S. health officials have recorded over 1,000 cases of the novel coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes, known as Covid-19. Worldwide cases exceed 125,000, nearly 5,000 of which have been fatal.) declared the outbreak a global pandemic.

President Trump declared a national emergency on [March 13th](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/) and granted [$42 billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/13/coronavirus-bill-house-nears-approval-free-tests-paid-sick-leave/5039259002/) to fight COVID-19.
1.1.2.5.3.1. Pro: President Trump delayed taking necessary steps by [up to six weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster) in some instances.
1.1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: Less than three weeks after telling [Bob Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Woodward) the disease was [very scary and deadlier than the flu](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-coronavirus-versus-bob-woodward-recorded-interviews/story?id=72912827), he repeatedly downplayed the threat to the American people and postponed lockdowns.
1.1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Most Americans think President Trump was too slow with his "[initial response to COVID-19 threat.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/04/16/most-americans-say-trump-was-too-slow-in-initial-response-to-coronavirus-threat/)"

1.1.2.6. Con: President Trump's actions during the first year of COVID-19 indicated how committed he was to fighting the crisis.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: President Trump's actions caused COVID-19 to become a pandemic with his [abroad](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv/exclusive-u-s-slashed-cdc-staff-inside-china-prior-to-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN21C3N5) and [local](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-cuts-undermine-coronavirus-containment-cdc-watchdog-report) staff cuts.
1.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: President Trump [cut funding from the WHO](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-cutting-who-funding-amid-coronavirus-could-cost-american-lives-2020-4) and [canceled an order of 80,000 ventilators](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html) because the price \($1 billion\) was 'too unrealistic'.
1.1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: With so many scams going on \(like the [fake PPE](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-riverside-and-rancho-cucamonga-men-arrested-on-suspicion-of-defrauding-ppe-distributors/)\), it makes sense to be cautious and figure out what makes sense before jumping in only to find out it isn't needed as much. There might've been something better and cheaper with what he was thinking, but we won't know if people think about why he thought it was too expensive, rather than what was his alternative.
1.1.2.6.1.2. Con: COVID-19 was a [pandemic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51839944) everywhere in the world independently of President Trump's actions.

1.1.2.6.1.3. Pro: President Trump's [staff cuts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-cuts-undermine-coronavirus-containment-cdc-watchdog-report) undermined COVID-19 containment efforts back at the beginning of the pandemic.
1.1.2.6.1.4. Con: According to the [White House](http://President Trump led the largest mobilization of public and private sector resources since WWII.), President Trump "led the largest mobilization of public and private sector resources since WWII."
1.1.2.6.2.

1.1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Thanks to [Operation Warp Speed and the allocated $14 billion](https://www.insideover.com/politics/operation-warp-speed-trumps-covid-success.html), President Trump ensured that the authorities, scientists, and companies’ efforts led to more unity in achieving the goal to find a vaccine.

1.1.2.6.4. Pro: President Trump [moved the tax filing date](https://apnews.com/article/2c64a8ff22ddc61ffce4bd52ffd020ef) from April 15 to July 15 2020 in order to provide relief to Americans during the pandemic.
1.1.2.6.5. Pro: On March 27th, 2020, President Trump signed the [CARES Act](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/house-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-sends-it-to-trump.html), a COVID-19 relief bill of $2 trillion to prevent economic devastation.
1.1.2.6.6. Con: Trump [knew how serious the virus was](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54094559) and hid the truth, downplaying the virus and doing nothing.
1.1.2.6.6.1. Pro: If Trump had taken the virus seriously; the death toll would be [notably less](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-usa-idUKKBN2BK0RG).
1.1.2.6.6.2. Con: Information was available to the public about the dangers of the virus from other reputable [domestic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/infection-control.html)(Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in a Variety of Settings Throughout Your Community\n\nGuidance About Preventing COVID-19 Infections in Diverse Settings) and [international](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54648684)(A simple virus has brought life as we know it to a screeching halt.\n\nWe have faced viral threats before, including pandemics, yet the world does not shut down for every new infection or flu season.\n\nSo what is it about this coronavirus? What are the quirks of its biology that pose a unique threat to our bodies and our lives?) sources.
1.1.2.7. Con: President Trump handled some health crises well.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: President Trump declared a [state of emergency for opioid addiction](https://www.whitehouse.gov/opioids/) which provided funding and a dedicated task force.

The report found little came out of the declaration.).
1.1.2.7.1.2. Pro: Positive outcomes have included [prescription monitoring programs](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4642-8)(rug monitoring programs \(PDMPs\) aim to increase patient safety by certifying that opioids are prescribed in appropriate quantities.) and expanded treatment.
1.1.3. Pro: President Trump gave much more freedom \(allowing people the liberty to do things on their own accord\) to Americans and the local government compared to other presidents.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Compared to other presidents in recent years, President Trump adopted a 'hands-free' management approach to let the local government do what they wanted to do, such as in the case of the [pandemic](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/16/trump-plan-for-reopening-economy-191073).
1.1.3.2. Con: President Trump didn't give the same freedom to all Americans, since he strengthened [racial division](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/racial-division-hallmark-trump-s-presidency-n1030286).
1.1.3.3. Pro: President Trump pushed for [deregulation](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/tracking-deregulation-in-the-trump-era/) during his administration, putting the responsibility of policymaking on the shoulders of the states, as intended in the US Constitution.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: He [removed many regulations](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/has-trump-killed-more-regulations-than-any-other-president/), in keeping with his [campaign promises](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/).

1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: The consequences of [deregulation can destroy peoples](https://www.epi.org/blog/deregulation-can-kill-you/) lives, lands, and freedoms.
1.1.3.3.1.3. Pro: The Trump administration [started 514 deregulatory rulemakings](https://accf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ACCF-Report_Trump-Deregulatory-Record-FINAL.pdf) on a wide range of issues at different agencies. \(p. 26\)
1.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Deregulation [increases](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/3xnlbuG9QuGJtYeKlOlvf5/what-is-deregulation/) [free-market](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/7Ium1gWWf54wd5wqr1XosD/what-is-a-free-market/) competition, giving consumers [more choice](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/what-are-some-advantages-market-economy-over-other-types-economies.asp).
1.1.3.3.1.5. Con: Removing regulations is only positive action when regulations do more harm than good. Blanket opposition to regulation can be highly destructive as many have been hard fought for and serve to protect citizens.
1.1.3.3.1.6. Con: President Trump honoring one promise didn't outweigh the numerous ways he reneged on promises or [lied during the campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/08/01/president-trump-has-made-4229-false-or-misleading-claims-in-558-days/?utm_term=.81b1043098b2), and in office.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: [Deregulation](https://www.citizen.org/news/trumps-deregulation-push-is-setting-the-stage-for-major-national-disasters/) was merely used for President Trump's corporate greed. Voters did not ask for it.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: According to the White House, Trump's administration reduced the size, scope, and cost of federal regulations for the first time in decades with [noticeable results](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The-Economic-Effects-of-Federal-Deregulation-Interim-Report.pdf).
1.1.3.3.4. Con: Deregulation can often increase [unhealthy risks taken by businesses](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/01/09/the-danger-in-deregulation/).
1.1.3.3.5. Con: Deregulation was a primary cause of the [2008 financial housing crisis](https://www.thebalance.com/what-caused-2008-global-financial-crisis-3306176#:~:text=Deregulation%20in%20the%20financial%20industry%20was%20the,of%20the%202008%20financial%20crash.&text=Since%20home%20loans%20were%20intimately,to%20its%20knees%20as%20well.).
1.1.3.3.6. Con: Some regulations must be equally placed on all participating members \(states\) to [ensure fair competition](https://www.mic.com/articles/3924/government-regulations-help-markets-work-better) in an open-market economy.
1.1.4. Con: President Trump passed insignificant legislation, which was also broadly ineffective.
1.1.4.1. Con: A President does not pass legislation. Therefore, no President has passed legislation.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [US Constitution, Article I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution) states that "all legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The final step of passing a bill into law is directly the responsibility of the President. [They can pass, veto, or abstain from signing the laws.](https://www.usa.gov/how-laws-are-made)
1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: When a representative sponsors a bill, it is then assigned to a committee for study. If released, it is then put on a calendar to be voted on \(by simple majority\), debated or amended. If voted, the [bill moves to the Senate](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/the-legislative-process).
1.1.4.1.2. Con: It is generally understood that a [President passes laws through Congress](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-legislative-branch/). Many Presidents have passed laws.
1.1.4.2. Con: [President Trump signed the First Step Act into law](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/what-first-step-act-and-whats-happening-it), marking the first legislative victory in years for advocates seeking to reform the criminal justice system at the federal level.
1.1.4.3. Con: President Trump passed the [VA Accountability Act](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/23/donald-trump-signs-va-accountability-act-law-promi/), allowing the firing of civil servants who mistreat veterans.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: To call this 'significant' is stretching the meaning of the word.
1.1.4.4. Con: President Trump passed the [VA Mission Act](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/06/trump-signs-law-expanding-vets-healthcare-choices/673906002/), which allows veterans to see a private doctor if they've been waiting too long for treatment.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.1.4.5. Pro: [A member within President Trump's administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) has branded his leadership style ineffective and his actual results non-existent.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: The NYT op-ed is an unacceptable attack on President Trump, possibly from what has been termed the 'deep state': [working and briefing against the President](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html), and [attempting to thwart](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/peter-strzok-fired-from-fbi-over-anti-trump-texts.html) his democratic mandate.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Their [anonymous, cowardly, and narcissistic attacks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/09/06/first-lady-melania-trump-condemns-anonymous-op-ed-writer-cowardly/1212385002/) have been [widely criticized on both the left and right.](https://observer.com/2018/09/why-democratic-strategist-are-slamming-the-anonymous-trump-op-ed/)
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: While it is true that it has been criticised on both the [left and right](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/5/13/21219164/trump-deep-state-fbi-cia-david-rohde), the reasons are wildly different. To conflate and group them together is a grave disservice to both arguments and a disingenuous way to launch an attack.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Con: An opinion piece in a newspaper hardly counts as a reliable source for the existence of the deep state.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro: The [deep state](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/15/834874400/in-deep-challenges-president-trump-s-notion-of-a-deep-state-conspiracy) conspiracy theory came to prominence during President Trump's election and campaign and has been furthered by his supporters without evidence.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: [TDS \(Trump Derangement Syndrome\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome)(Trump derangement syndrome \(TDS\) is a pejorative term usually for criticism or negative reactions to United States President Donald Trump that are perceived to be irrational, and have little regard towards Trump's actual policy positions, or actions undertaken by his administration.) is a label President Trump and his supporters commonly use.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Many [therapists claim](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/07/30/psychiatrist-debunks-trump-anxiety-disorder-says-it-partisan-pop-psychology) there is no such thing as TAD or [TDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Derangement_Syndrome) and it is instead "partisan pop psychology".
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is not an [officially](https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/38179-trump-anxiety-disorder) recognized diagnosis. Even if there were anxiety, many would consider it [justifiable](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-men/201901/is-trump-derangement-syndrome-real-mental-condition?page=1) given the President's actions.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: President Trump had a tendency to label anything negative about himself as "fake news", while doing nothing to discourage or attack other sources of fake news, such as [Pizzagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory#Responses).
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: President Trump frequently used the terms "[#NoCollusion](https://www.politico.eu/article/mueller-refutes-trumps-no-collusion-no-obstruction-line/)" and "[#WitchHunt](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-kimberly-guilfoyle-witch-hunt-halloween-costume-2019-11)" when the investigation still being on-going. These statements appeared to be politically motivated.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1.4. Pro: During the Trump Presidential campaign, he frequently led chants of ["Drain the Swamp"](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/trump-making-swamp-worse/599344/) and ["Lock her up"](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/from-lock-her-up-to-send-her-back-trump-in-north-carolina), two things he made no serious effort to when he become President.
1.1.4.5.1.2.2. Pro: The [deep state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States) displays all the [hall](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/conspiracy-theory) [marks](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy%20theory) of a [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory) [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conspiracy_theories#Deep_State). And just as much [evidence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conspiracy_theory). [Interestingly](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/conspiracy-theory), the [definition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/conspiracy-theory) of who or what the deep state is changes based on the speaker and their goals at the time.
1.1.4.5.1.2.3. Con: Anonymous officials working against President Trump met the definition of the deep state. The op-ed was precisely the definition of proof.
1.1.4.5.1.3. Pro: The "[deep state](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-deep-state-is-and-why-trump-gets-it-wrong-2020-1)" refers to "elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process."
1.1.4.5.1.3.1. Pro: The anonymous author of the NYT op-ed admitted to either being and/or working with unelected officials seeking to thwart the goals of the electorate as expressed through the election of President Trump, thus meeting the definition.
1.1.4.6. Pro: President Trump spent [minimal time](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/the-ineffective-executive-how-trumps-laziness-is-destroying-his-presidency) doing his job, giving the impression of laziness.
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: President Trump made 285 trips to play [golf](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2020/11/11/how-often-has-president-trump-played-golf-since-he-took-office-infographic/?sh=1edcf39d7b02) during his time in office, compared to only 105 trips by President Obama.
1.1.4.6.1.1. Pro: These trips are estimated to have cost American taxpayers [$142 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2020/11/11/how-often-has-president-trump-played-golf-since-he-took-office-infographic/?sh=1edcf39d7b02).
1.1.4.6.2. Pro: President Trump has spent the majority of his working hours in the vaguely titled and unstructured '[Executive time](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-leaked-schedules-789367/).'
1.1.4.6.3. Con: As a president of the United States, President Trump had staff who were with him at all times, meaning that it was possible for him to work while traveling and away from the White House. This meant that he was not necessarily being lazy.
1.1.4.7. Pro: Corporate America reached the point of [working around](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-is-irrelevant-to-corporate-america) President Trump rather than waiting for him to pass legislation that would benefit the sector.
1.1.4.8. Pro: Many of Trump's legislative achievements were [executive orders](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-executive-orders-barack-obama-president-powers-a9163431.html)(It wasn’t too long ago that Donald Trump derided presidential executive orders as “power grabs” and a “basic disaster.”\n\nHe’s switched sides in a big way: In each year of his presidency, he has issued more executive orders than did former President Barack Obama during the same time span. He surpassed Mr Obama’s third-year total just recently.\n\n\[...\]\n\nAn executive order can have the same effect as a federal law — but its impact can be fleeting. Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order and future presidents can undo them.), which are easy for a subsequent administration to undo.
1.1.4.9. Pro: He [mishandled](https://secondnexus.com/news/paul-ryan-repeats-trump-puerto-rico/) and mismanaged the disaster relief of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. He has since denied that was the case without evidence.
1.1.4.10. Pro: President Trump did certainly not show good judgment and/or the managerial ability to build and maintain a stable administrative team around him, which reflected negatively on him as President.
1.1.4.10.1. Pro: It has been frequently claimed that President Trump [didn't read](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/breaking-with-tradition-trump-skips-presidents-written-intelligence-report-for-oral-briefings/2018/02/09/b7ba569e-0c52-11e8-95a5-c396801049ef_story.html) [briefings](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2018-02-09/why-it-matters-that-trump-doesnt-read-his-daily-intelligence-briefings) [or memos](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-doesnt-read-daily-briefings-oral-listens-2018-2), had a [low attention](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-does-not-read-white-house-top-secret-intelligence-briefings-big-617515) [span](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/americas-first-post-text-president/549794/), was [fact resistant](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-briefings-232479), and [didn't care](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/rex-tillerson-trump-undisciplined-doesnt-like-read-tries-do-illegal-things/) [for the](https://www.thedailybeast.com/rex-tillerson-i-had-to-stop-trump-from-doing-illegal-things) [rule of law.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/7/18130476/rex-tillerson-interview-bob-schieffer-donald-trump-doesnt-like-read-tries-do-illegal-things/)
1.1.4.10.1.1. Pro: It has alternately been claimed that President Trump didn't like to read, or that he [may have actually been functionally illiterate](https://percolately.com/jake/trump-bush-funeral-cant-read-apostles-creed/?utm_content=inf_10_4134_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_e61426c0f98f11e8871cc5c94d0ec567), even possibly dyslexic.
1.1.4.10.2. Pro: The unbelievable rate of firings and/or resignations in President Trump's team was [unprecedented](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/16/us/politics/all-the-major-firings-and-resignations-in-trump-administration.html).
1.1.4.10.2.1. Pro: President Trump gave roles in his administration to his son, his daughter, and his son-in-law. Despite [evidence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45079377) that two of them may have [committed](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/27/opinions/how-cohen-claim-could-affect-trump-callan/index.html) potentially criminal wrongdoing and [potentially](http://fortune.com/2018/07/28/trump-donald-jr-russia-meeting/) even [illegal](https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/trump-jr-legal-problems/index.html) [acts](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-worried-about-legal-trouble-for-trump-jr_us_5b6656aee4b0b15abaa3e7da), President [Trump](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/400414-trump-fears-trump-jr-may-have-accidentally-gotten-in-legal-trouble) [kept them](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-jared-kushner-ivanka-white-house) while releasing others. This might have been a sign of [nepotism](https://patch.com/us/white-house/nepotism-white-house-how-trumps-family-bigger-liability-his-twitter-feed), hardly an effective management style.
1.1.4.10.2.1.1. Pro: It also raised [conflict](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/18/why-donald-trumps-family-being-in-the-white-house-is-problematic-explained/) of [interest](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-family-members-have-gotten-much-richer-president-moved-white-house-975993) issues.
1.1.4.10.2.2. Pro: Conversely, a bad leader would refuse to admit or acknowledge mistakes and would not fire even critically inept staff. There were members of his [team](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/letat-cest-trump/526431/) that President Trump [refused](https://www.newsweek.com/ronny-jackson-veterans-affairs-secretary-donald-trump-865025) to fire or replace [due](http://theconversation.com/why-does-a-president-demand-loyalty-from-people-who-work-for-him-95199) to [their](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/06/donald-trump-loyalty-staff-217227) [personal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/02/01/what-trump-really-means-when-he-demands-loyalty/) [loyalty](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/06/07/trump-personally-asked-to-end-fbis-flynn-investigation-comey-says-contradicting-trumps-claim.html) to [him](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/8/15759568/comey-testimony-loyalty-psychologists).
1.1.4.10.2.3. Con: A significant portion of Trump's fame was derived from his penchant for saying: "[You're fired](https://youtu.be/CHzdxly0Y9Q)". It was hardly unbelievable that President Trump fired people at a faster rate than normal.
1.1.4.10.2.3.1. Con: Running the Presidency like a reality TV show is hardly likely to be seen as the hallmark of a "Good" President.
1.1.4.10.2.4. Con: President Trump was elected with a mandate to 'drain the swamp' and change the way politics operated, and so it would have been surprising if he did follow precedent. He had an electoral mandate to be unprecedented, and it was, therefore, a sign that he was fulfilling his pledge to the American people.
1.1.4.10.2.4.1. Con: It can hardly be said that filling the administration with sycophants, family members, donors \(or donor puppets\) and rich friends equates to "draining the swamp".
1.1.4.10.2.4.2. Con: If he were actually engaging in 'draining the swamp' we would expect to see him firing a great many people, certainly, but we would not expect him to be firing the very people he brought in with the regularity that he has been.
1.1.4.10.3. Con: Good leaders know when to make managerial changes. The job of a productive President is fast-paced. If he made bad picks, he should have figured out how to fix and replace those appointments quickly.
1.1.4.10.3.1. Con: President [Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/candidate-trump-promised-best-people-cabinet-50183308) [has](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/09/15/trump-ill-choose-the-best-people-for-my-administration.html) invited [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-14/trump-s-vow-to-hire-the-best-people-isn-t-panning-out) criticism [of](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2017/12/29/hires-best-people/) [himself](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/sep/12/trump-promised-to-hire-the-best-people-he-keeps-hiring-the-worst-nasa-is-next) through [his](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-omarosa/index.html) [own](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/08/14/why-are-so-many-people-trump-hires-corrupt-incompetent-and-immoral/) [words](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/opinion/trumps-best-people-are-the-worst.html) [and](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/04/13/the-best-people-trump-personnel-picks-haunt-him/NDRUo7qgUNFMSSTcA7ZDWL/story.html) [his](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/times/story/2018/aug/19/all-presidents-best-people/477174/) [appointments](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/08/24/trump-surrounded-by-best-people/).
1.1.4.10.4. Pro: President Trump's cabinet choices were chiefly opponents of the office they held and were [corrupt](https://www.edfaction.org/scott-pruitts-web-fundraising-and-lawsuits) [forces](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/03/599145343/epa-chief-pruitt-faces-mounting-scrutiny-for-ethics-violations).
1.1.4.10.4.1. Con: It has now been shown that the Russia FBI investigation into him was [politically motivated](http://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/395776-memos-detail-fbis-hurry-the-f-up-pressure-to-probe-trump-campaign).
1.1.4.10.4.1.1. Con: That as may be, [nineteen people and three companies](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/donald-trump-fbi-spy-claims-robert-mueller-russia-investigation) have been indicted. There was genuine corruption to be found, regardless of motive.
1.1.4.10.4.1.1.1. Con: None of these indictments relate to the campaign, so the conclusion of genuine corruption is false.
1.1.4.10.4.1.2. Con: That assertion was jumped to by a partisan Republican party, but the investigation was still underway and individuals tied to the campaign were pleading guilty.
1.1.4.10.4.1.2.1. Con: This is not true - it was evidenced by the clearly biased [actions and motives](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/politics/peter-strzok-fired-fbi/index.html) of Clinton idealogue Peter Strzok abusing his position in the FBI to [further his political agenda](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/fbi-texts-trump.html), for which he had been fired.
1.1.4.10.4.1.2.1.1. Con: [No motivation of bias was found in his conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Strzok) or investigations, he also worked on investigating Hilary and shared anti-Hilary texts as well.
1.1.4.10.4.1.2.1.2. Con: The investigation was called for by thousands of citizens, congressmen, political opinion writers, and more, months before anyone knew Peter Strzok's name.
1.1.4.10.4.2. Pro: President Trumps' Commerce Secretary, [Wilbur Ross](https://www.needtoimpeach.com/corruption/wilbur-ross-corrupt-cabinet/), had been accused of corruption.
1.1.4.10.4.3. Pro: Several campaign managers are in [prison](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47491688) for various crimes.
1.1.4.10.4.4. Con: Being opponents of the actions previously taken in the name of the offices they hold is not corruptive, but rather essential in a healthy and functioning democracy.
1.1.4.10.4.4.1. Con: This is anti-democratic, flying in the face of countless thousands of sections of law, undermining the democratically documented will of the republic.
1.1.4.10.4.4.2. Con: This strategy is a massive waste of tax payer dollars. The programs that are being undermined were never de-funded.
1.1.4.10.4.4.3. Con: Selecting a supreme court justice based on his previous comments that the president should not be held accountable for any crime is explicitly corrupt.
1.1.4.10.5. Con: It is unclear whether his managerial style showed good judgment, as there were [two completely different stories](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/09/09/pence_woodward_book_a_complete_misunderstanding_of_how_this_white_house_works_its_not_for_everybody.html) on the goings-on in the White House. A negative picture was painted by anonymous people or people with [little credibility](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/omarosa-has-no-credibility-but-liberals-love-her-because-she-hates-trump), while a positive picture was painted by everyone else who worked or had worked there.
1.1.4.10.5.1. Con: There were three different sources for the conflict and turmoil in the White House - the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Trump-White-Bob-Woodward/dp/1501175513), the [opinion article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html), and [Omarosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKCcMK3_vdM).
1.1.4.10.5.1.1. Con: The combined weight of three things that carry no weight is nothing. There is no credible source willing to lend their name to the rumours, yet plenty of respectable people who have said on the record that they do not recognise the anonymous descriptions.
1.1.4.10.5.1.1.1. Con: Bob Woodward is a Pulitzer prize wining journalist, who has published 18 political books. Alll 18 have been national bestsellers and 12 of them have been No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers—more No. 1 national nonfiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. He was one of two journalists that did most of the investigation and reporting on the Watergate Scandal. Woodward himself has been a recipient of nearly every major American journalism award. This gives his words weight.
1.1.4.10.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The above claim is a great example of the “[appeal to authority](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)” fallacy.
1.1.4.10.5.1.1.2. Con: Many of the key people rejecting the story would lose power by publicly accepting it, which is a possible motivation to lie.
1.1.4.10.5.1.2. Con: Omarosa appeared to have recorded most of her time in the White House, and yet none of her tapes released that far suggested a White House in chaos or unreasonable behaviour by President Trump.
1.1.4.10.5.2. Con: When comparing the story of Bob Woodward, a twice-Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist \(who covered Watergate and 8 presidencies\) and the story of a politician, one can expect the stories to be inconsistent.
1.1.4.10.5.2.1. Pro: Vice President Pence would deliver whatever statement painted his office and his party in the best light, as would every senior White House staff member. They were not beholden to the truth.
1.1.4.10.5.2.2. Con: This would not be the first time Bob Woodward got the wrong end of the stick. His biography on John Belushi was [criticised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/06/04/friends-of-belushi-criticize-wired/7c394846-1b6a-4702-a79a-83534acd1102/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1224cdc045d3) as "unfair," "humorless" and "depressing", and which a subsequent biographer found [very troubling.](https://amp.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/03/bob_woodward_and_gene_sperling_what_woodward_s_john_belushi_book_can_tell.html)
1.1.4.10.5.2.2.1. Con: This is less an example of Bob Woodward getting a story “completely wrong” and more an example of two writers having different attitudes about the subject. The writer of the article above even acknowledges that Woodward was generally correct with the facts, but assembled them to the wrong overall story in their mind.
1.1.4.10.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: A quote from the article explains that this book is not a great representation of Woodward’s overall body of work: “Wired is an anomaly in the Woodward catalog, the only book he’s ever written about a subject other than Washington.“
1.1.4.10.5.3. Con: [Bob Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Woodward) was neither anonymous \(though admittedly, his sources were\), nor lacked credibility.
1.1.4.10.5.4. Pro: UN Ambassador and former Governor Nikki Haley [said that](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/nikki-haley-take-bob-woodwards-book-with-a-grain-of-salt)(“I know that the president has been a great partner to me on foreign security. I meet with him often. I talk with him often. When I have concerns, I bring them to him. He listens, he's respectful, and he engages back.”) Woodward's book should have been taken with a grain of salt'.
1.1.4.10.5.5. Pro: President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, [made the point](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/giuliani-says-diaper-anecdote-woodward-054236136.html) that Woodward's book included an unflattering anecdote involving him, which Giuliani claimed it was false. Woodward never tried to interview Giuliani about it and left Woodward open to the charge that he relied too much on second-hand accounts rather than primary sources.
1.1.4.10.5.5.1. Con: An 'unflattering anecdote' may well have been something Giuliani wished to distance himself from.
1.1.4.10.5.5.2. Con: Bob Woodward [claimed](https://www.comicsands.com/bob-woodward-has-the-receipts-2604988932.html?utm_content=inf_10_3759_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_31e10a80b90f11e8872dc93302272904) to have tapes of all interviews and quotes and said he would release them if anyone publicly asked or claimed to have been misquoted.
1.1.4.10.5.5.2.1. Pro: President Trump [claimed](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-woodward-call) that he never spoke to Woodward in any capacity. While this was true for the content of the book, [Woodward](https://www.newsandguts.com/video/must-listen-bob-woodward-tapes-conversation-donald-trump/) [released](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/04/transcript-phone-call-between-president-trump-journalist-bob-woodward/) a [tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ8aGoEYV2Y) [showing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/bob-woodward-donald-trump-phone-call/index.html) that he did in fact speak to Trump just before the book's launch.
1.1.4.10.6. Pro: President Trump selected [Brett Kavanaugh](https://time.com/5417538/bett-kavanaugh-confirmed-senate-supreme-court/), a transparently partisan individual accused of rape and perjury, for the Supreme Court.
1.1.4.10.6.1. Con: The accusations against Kavanaugh were flimsy and likely fabricated.
1.1.4.10.6.1.1. Con: [Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct allegations](https://www.vox.com/2019/9/16/20868338/brett-kavanaugh-new-york-times-impeachment-allegations) led to new reporting in 2019, which led to calls for Kavanaugh’s impeachment.
1.1.4.10.6.1.2. Pro: Julie Swetnick's accusation lacked corroboration. She [changed her story](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/10/02/guy-benson-julie-swetnick-brett-kavanaugh-allegation-nbc-news-interview), had a less than stellar [legal history](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/3rd-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-julie-swetnick-has-history-of-legal-disputes/), and had several people who knew her and attested to her [untrustworthy character.](https://nypost.com/2018/09/26/third-kavanaugh-accusers-ex-boyfriend-once-accused-her-of-domestic-violence/)
1.1.4.10.6.1.2.1. Con: Swetnick's affidavit "[adds credibility to the image of Kavanaugh](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/9/26/17906130/brett-kavanaugh-julie-swetnick-renate-dolphin)(Her affidavit adds credibility to the image of Kavanaugh painted by Ford, Ramirez, and former Georgetown Prep and Yale University students: someone who repeatedly victimized women in his time at the elite institutions that ostensibly prepared him for his career.)" painted by the other women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
1.1.4.10.6.1.2.2. Pro: Swetnick was [referred to the Justice Department](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/25/politics/julie-swetnick-justice-department-judiciary-committee/index.html) in 2018.
1.1.4.10.6.2. Pro: It seems [very plausible](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/2/17927606/brett-kavanaugh-perjury-lied-congress) that Kavanaugh committed perjury.
1.1.4.10.6.2.1. Con: It is possible that Kavanaugh's legal team were the ones involved in the text messages. Without the texts themselves, it is not clear either way.
1.1.4.10.6.2.2. Con: In regards to the question of text messages in relation to Ramirez's accusation, Kavanaugh may have heard of the incoming accusation, even if he had no certainty it would emerge or knowledge of details. Kavanaugh could have interpreted the question of when he first heard of the accusations as when he had heard of the details.
1.1.4.10.6.2.2.1. Con: His claims to not know her outside of University however were shown to be false. They were bridesmaid and Groomsman at a wedding together and are pictured together in a photo.
1.1.4.10.6.2.3. Con: On the subject of drinking, Kavanaugh admitted to drinking too much, but [claimed never to have "blacked out"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kavanaugh-says-he-never-blacked-out-from-drinking-yeah-right/2018/09/25/60bba4d4-c0f1-11e8-be77-516336a26305_story.html), referring to an alcohol-induced period of amnesia. Whether he experienced a black out is almost entirely a case of his own state of mind, and so impossible to prove.
1.1.4.10.6.2.3.1. Con: He also says he never drank [underage](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/26/17901076/brett-kavanaugh-drinking-high-school-sexual-assault-allegations). The legal drinking age at the time was 21. He was 18. Someone familiar with the law would realise it.
1.1.4.10.6.2.3.2. Con: He carefully qualified that he never blacked out from drinking beer, and evasively never acknowledged or denied a possibility of blacking out from liquor, wine, or any other intoxicant.
1.1.4.10.6.2.4. Con: In terms of the yearbook slang, despite modern definitions differing from Kavanaugh's account, we had evidence that [boof can refer to flatulence](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/brett-kavanaugh-meaning-of-boof/), we have a testimony and other yearbook entries that refer to FFFFF as an inside joke and devil's triangle as a game.
1.1.4.10.6.2.4.1. Con: We also have testimony from some of his other "friends" and classmates that he lied about these definitions, the same with Rentate Alumnus.
1.1.4.10.6.2.5. Con: In the case of the stolen Democratic emails, this is a question of a state of mind. If Kavanaugh claimed that he did not notice their origins, proof is required. Perhaps a documented reference to the stolen emails as stolen would suffice, but none have appeared. As such, this does not meet the grounds for perjury.
1.1.4.10.6.2.6. Pro: He claimed that he didn't have time for parties and never attended any. His own calendar shows at least 2, if not 3 in that one month.
1.1.4.10.6.2.7. Pro: Justice Kavanaugh clearly committed perjury when explaining the meaning of a [Devil's Triangle](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Devils%20Triangle) while under oath during the Senate hearing of his nomination.
1.1.4.11. Con: President Trump also removed the [Obamacare individual mandate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/trump-touts-repeal-of-obamacare-individual-mandate.html), which was the key objection of Republicans to Obamacare.
1.1.4.11.1. Pro: He repealed by [executive order](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/12/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order/index.html)(President Donald Trump took his first steps Thursday toward fulfilling his vow to dismantle Obamacare, signing an executive order that he says will bring affordable health insurance to millions more people.\n\nThe order broadly tasks the administration with developing policies to increase health care competition and choice in order to improve the quality of health care and lower prices.) elements of the Affordable Healthcare Act that cost Americans a fortune.
1.1.4.11.1.1. Con: [He failed to replace it with anything meaningful](https://ballotpedia.org/Affordable_Care_Act_under_the_Trump_administration)(The House passed its bill—the American Health Care Act of 2017—but members of the Senate have been unable to agree on a final replacement plan, leaving most of the provisions of the ACA in place. Republicans did take one step towards changing the ACA by eliminating the law's individual mandate, which took effect in January 2019.), which means he only fulfilled half a promise.
1.1.4.11.1.2. Con: The Affordable Healthcare Act lowered the growth of long-term spending and government costs by over [$1 trillion](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/90471/2001288-the_evidence_on_recent_health_care_spending_growth_and_the_impact_of_the_affordable_care_act.pdf), due to the cost controls it included.
1.1.4.11.1.3. Pro: By [developing policies to increase health care competition and choice](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/ERP-2020/pdf/ERP-2020-chapter5.pdf), President Trump improved the quality of health care and lowered the prices. \(p.171\)
1.1.4.11.1.3.1. Con: Healthcare in America is still one of the [most expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/us-healthcare-costs-causes-drug-prices-salaries) in the world.
1.1.4.11.1.3.1.1. Pro: This cripples many lower and middle class families who cannot afford healthcare.
1.1.4.11.1.3.2. Pro: [The Trump Administration lowered prescription drug prices](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/healthcare/), expanded access to affordable coverage, and allowed Americans to access trusted doctors.
1.1.4.11.1.4. Pro: President Trump [included a provision in his 2017 legislation to eliminate the ObamaCare penalt](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/385722-trump-has-quietly-saved-millions-from-obamacares-individual-mandate/)y, which cost $695 per adult or 2.5% of household income.
1.1.4.11.1.4.1. Con: Millions of people could lose their health insurance as a result of this repeal, many of them [could die](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/23/repealing-the-affordable-care-act-will-kill-more-than-43000-people-annually/).
1.1.4.11.1.4.1.1. Con: The people who will lose health insurance are those who do not want health insurance.
1.1.4.11.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The people who would lose health insurance would be [those that can't afford it](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/).
1.1.4.11.1.4.1.2. Pro: High deductible insurance was causing many people to forgo healthcare and [important medications](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/millions-skip-medications-due-to-their-high-cost-201501307673).
1.1.4.12. Con: President Trump [secured initial funding](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/23/donald-trump-border-wall-16-million-funding-restrictions-attached/) for building a wall on the border with Mexico in 2018.
1.1.4.12.1. Con: President Trump failed to build a wall and make Mexico [pay for it](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/).
1.1.4.12.1.1. Pro: Not only was there no funding secured for building a wall, but President Trump also later denied he had ever claimed that [Mexico would be paying for the wall](https://time.com/5499391/donald-trump-border-wall-mexico-pay/).
1.1.4.12.1.2. Pro: "I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.” - [No element](https://qz.com/1172972/trumps-border-wall-keeps-getting-shorter-and-more-expensive/) of this was truthful, and it was ostensibly arrogant.
1.1.4.12.1.3. Con: [It was reported](https://youtu.be/LiaiL-dHIDQ) that the US and Mexico were in the process of finalizing a trade deal that was more advantageous to the US than the previous one, which could have resulted in more tax revenue flowing in the US government coffers.
1.1.4.12.1.3.1. Con: A trade deal with Mexico favoring the US didn't mean that Mexico would end up paying for the wall, the two are separate matters.
1.1.4.12.2. Pro: The Trump administration notified Congress in February 2018 of its plans to divert [$3.8 billion from the Defense Department's budget](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805796618/trump-administration-diverts-3-8-billion-in-pentagon-funding-to-border-wall) to build the border wall.
1.1.4.12.3. Con: A border wall is an ineffective measure, given [tunnels](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/us/drug-tunnel-arizona-mexico-trnd/index.html) and [sea routes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigrants-turn-to-sea-to-enter-us-illegally/).
1.1.4.12.4. Con: The wall was considered to likely be [ineffective](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-executive-order-mexican-border-wall-impact/), according to many border patrol agents, and also [hinder them](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-patrol-officers-us-mexico-border-wall/) in doing their job by restricting viability and line of sight, among other issues.
1.1.4.12.4.1. Pro: The wall has had many [unintended side-effects](https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/).
1.1.4.12.4.2. Pro: The [effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_wall#Effectiveness) of [the wall](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/immigration/border-walls-barriers-fences-research/) is [still debatable](https://www.rand.org/blog/2019/01/what-border-walls-can-and-cannot-accomplish.html), [considered to be equal](https://www.aeaweb.org/research/border-wall-effectiveness-ben-feigenberg) to other equally costed measures, [with many considering](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-wall-wont-work) it a [waste of time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-border-wall-was-a-complete-waste-of-time-and-money/2020/12/24/444c165e-4564-11eb-b0e4-0f182923a025_story.html).
1.1.4.12.4.3. Con: [Some sources suggest](https://www.cbp.gov/frontline/border-security) the wall to be [effective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_wall#Effectiveness) and working, though [the impartiality of these sources was disputed](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/10/29/border-wall-system-deployed-effective-and-disrupting-criminals-and-smugglers#:~:text=CBP%20has%20seen%2079%25%20decrease,wall%20system%20in%20this%20area.).
1.1.5. Pro: President Trump's foreign policy achievements demonstrated that he was a good president.
1.1.5.1. Con: Something that seems to be good for the USA in the short term does not necessarily mean it is good for the USA in the long term. Long term ramifications are likely to weaken the USA in a variety of areas.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Warming and thawing relations with Russia, while a good goal of peace, is meaningless when it is demonstrated and shown they have not changed the ways [that got those sanctions imposed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45415.pdf) in the first place.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War) continued to support the Syrian regime of [Bashar Al-Assad](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/syriasource/three-years-later-the-evolution-of-russia-s-military-intervention-in-syria/), despite [his use of illegal chemical weapons](https://www.opcw.org/documents-related-syria).
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Criticizing NATO, NATO Allies and thinking of reducing the NATO budget will weaken ties and trust among the organisation, thus weakening the partnership, which could cause problems in the future.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: This is a slippery slope argument. While criticising NATO could weaken ties and trust, it does not necessarily mean it will create a chain reaction of weakening NATO itself, which will then lead to problems of the future.
1.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: His [attacks on the WHO](https://uk.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-donald-trumps-criticism-world-health-organisation-response-225700111.html) were generally rebuffed by the rest of the economically developed nations. Withholding funding and sowing doubt and mistrust will likely have long-term consequences.
1.1.5.1.2.3. Pro: We are already seeing some of those problems in Europe, Eastern Europe and Turkey.
1.1.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: [Turkey has bought Russian](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/13/europe/turkey-russia-missiles-nato-analysis-intl/index.html) [Anti-Air and Missile Defence Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-400_missile_system), causing a [possibly irreconcilable](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48620087) [rift within NATO](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/02/turkeys-arms-deal-with-russia-casts-shadow-over-nato-summit.html), [in defiance of the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/world/europe/turkey-russia-missiles.html).

1.1.5.1.2.3.2. Con: The current war in Ukraine shows that NATO could be a [threat for the European security](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61369963).
1.1.5.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Europe no longer feels it can rely on the United States](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/27/europe-can-no-longer-rely-on-us-for-security-says-emmanuel-macron) [in any role](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/387067-merkel-europe-cant-count-on-us-to-protect-us-anymore) - [diplomatic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44045957) [partner](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/trump-russia-g7.html) [in many roles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/25/g7-trumps-demands-for-russias-readmission-causes-row-in-biarritz), [trade](https://fortune.com/2019/10/14/us-eu-trade-war-airbus-vs-boeing-wto-gives-okay-us-7-5-billion-eu-import-tariffs/) [partner](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/the-impact-of-us-sanctions-on-european-goods-a-closer-look/) or for [security,](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-defense-macron-cant-depend-on-us-for-security/) and [as such feels](https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/europes-defense-debate-is-all-about-america/) [it needs a](https://www.ft.com/content/51ed8b90-43b9-11e7-8519-9f94ee97d996) [United European Army instead of NATO](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/05/europe-is-ready-for-its-own-army/) \([though many analysts forecast it will not be able to do so, only complement it](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA843CA843&sxsrf=ALeKk03fWLv_Ytt5Xv2bt-dMz0OmkrNyqA%3A1588212051789&ei=UzGqXuTVL4aUtAaQzpqYDw&q=european+army+to+replace+nato&oq=european+army+&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgQIIxAnMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgQIABBHOgYIABAWEB5Q3skCWLDYAmDF6QJoAHACeACAAZ4BiAGHDJIBBDAuMTGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab)\).

1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Trump's behavior alienated many of America's traditional allies, such as [Canada](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trump-slams-canada-on-twitter-suggests-replacing-nafta-with-separate-deals-1.3954972), [Britain](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/05/politics/trump-nra-speech-angers-french/index.html), [Australia](https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/malcolm-turnbull-donald-trump-pena-nieto/index.html), [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-abe-pearl-harbor-remember-ripped-trade-1093230), [Europe](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/trump-attacks-europes-refugee-policies-falsely-says-crime-in-germany-is-way-up) and most other members of [NATO](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/09/donald-trump-slams-nato-allies-military-spending-ahead-leaving/). This was unlikely to be in America's best interests in the long run.
1.1.5.1.3.1. Con: [NATO is, in 2022, stronger than it was before](https://www.nato-pa.int/news/nato-allies-urged-boost-military-aid-ukraine-strengthen-eastern-flank-defences), which shows that President Trump's behavior didn't alienated traditional allies.
1.1.5.1.3.2. Pro: President Trump's actions also weakened ties with other countries, creating a space for other global powers such as [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/us/politics/us-latin-america-china.html) to replace the US.
1.1.5.1.3.3. Pro: The hegemony of the USA over the world is due to its alliances and standing with other modern, powerful countries. Damaging these relations would also damage its strength.
1.1.5.1.4. Con: [Since US Presidents are only elected for 4 years,](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/633015/why-presidents-serve-four-year-terms) it is understandable that they would try to improve the country in the short term.
1.1.5.2. Con: President Trump's [actions](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/top-special-ops-marine-who-fought-kurds-blasts-trump-move-n1065901) to pull troops out of Syria in October 2019, led to further death and another situation where America betrayed its allies.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: These actions threaten to [further empower ISIS](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/trump-defends-syria-withdrawal-amid-reports-of-atrocities-and-isis-supporters-escaping.html) as it was done without much planning and consultation with the US military or its allies.
1.1.5.2.2. Pro: President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria was widely condemned by even his [most ardent supporters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/evangelicals-syria-trump-criticism.html).
1.1.5.2.3. Con: President Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria was justified because he wanted to put an end to what he called [the United States’ role as a global policeman](https://www.rferl.org/a/trump-surprise-visit-u-s-troops-iraq/29678078.html).
1.1.5.3. Pro: President Trump left a good trade and diplomacy legacy.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: President Trump's approach towards Russia was quite punitive.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Under President Trump, the US military killed 200 Russian soldiers [for crossing into US-controlled land in Syria](http://www.newsweek.com/us-military-killed-200-russians-syria-airstrikes-pompeo-says-trump-considers-883947).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: It was considered the "[most lethal clash between US and Russian citizens since the end of the cold war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/russian-mercenaries-killed-us-airstrikes-syria)".
1.1.5.3.1.1.2. Con: The presence of US troops in Syria was a [violation of international law](https://richardfalk.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/contra-syria-attack/). As opposed to this, Russia was invited there by the government of Syria.
1.1.5.3.1.2. Pro: President Trump authorized the [sale of lethal weapons](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-weapons-ukraine-20171222-story.html) to Ukraine.
1.1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: The weapons weren't [used](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/ukraines-successful-courtship-of-trump/559526/).
1.1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Some of the [toughest ever sanctions](http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/397212-president-trump-is-tougher-on-russia-in-18-months-than-obama-in-eight) on Putin's allies in Russia were put in place while Trump, not Obama, was president.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1. Con: The sanctions mentioned were not the work of President Trump. The sanctions "upheld" in January 2017 were [originally imposed by Obama](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack), and those from August 2018 were pushed through by a [veto-proof majority](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/politics/fact-check-pompeo-sanctions-russia.html) in Congress.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: President Trump [seemed](https://www.dw.com/en/us-congress-pushes-for-new-russia-sanctions-after-election-meddling-intel/a-44951543) [unwilling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/30/even-if-trump-is-blatantly-ignoring-the-russia-sanctions-law-theres-not-a-lot-congress-can-do-about-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f4091ff72524) to [impose sanctions](https://www.vox.com/2017/7/29/16061878/trump-russian-sanctions-sign) on Russia.
1.1.5.3.1.4. Pro: President Trump [bombed Syria for crossing US red lines](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/13/trump-to-address-the-nation-about-syria-nbc-news.html) whereas President Obama allowed [red lines](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/08/20/remarks-president-white-house-press-corps) [to be crossed without consequence](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/15/17238568/syria-bomb-trump-obama-russia), greatly weakening the US.
1.1.5.3.1.4.1. Con: Comparing President Trump to Obama is not a good measurement of a US president's success. Each presidency is different in what it has to deal with and Obama did not have a [massively successful](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/04/06/the-fragile-legacy-of-barack-obama/) presidency.
1.1.5.3.1.5. Con: President Trump received [massive criticism](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-today-07-19-18/h_3761f1662b0836600ef8a508fa63f563) [from the Intelligence community](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/16/17576804/trump-putin-meeting-john-brennan-tweet-treasonous) for [taking Putin's side on Russian election meddling](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/17/629601233/trumps-helsinki-bow-to-putin-leaves-world-wondering-whats-up) at the Helsinki summit.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1. Con: The [intelligence community](https://youtu.be/6RmEsPE7iq0) is not something benevolent to take criticism from.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: The CIA used [faulty intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Report_on_Pre-war_Intelligence_on_Iraq) to start the Iraq war on purpose, creating an ongoing problem.
1.1.5.3.1.6. Con: President Trump [repeatedly ignored](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/16/putin-told-trump-russia-never-meddled-in-us-election.html) the [intelligence community's assessment](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/16/us/elections/russian-interference-statements-comments.html) that Russia meddled in the U.S. election.
1.1.5.3.1.7. Con: President Trump changed the GOP platform to be [friendlier to Russia](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568310790/2016-rnc-delegate-trump-directed-change-to-party-platform-on-ukraine-support).
1.1.5.3.1.7.1. Con: Being friendlier or wanting de-escalation with other nations is a good sign for a President.
1.1.5.3.1.7.2. Con: Presidents that were populists and fed the bigoted and racist people with such politics started [multiple wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars:_2003%E2%80%93present) that are still going on. Politicians like [Biden](https://www.voanews.com/episode/biden-vows-stand-russia-embrace-nato-4531776), [Hillary](https://youtu.be/k2oWNgcfZM8), [Obama](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/16/obama-says-russians-cant-change-us-or-weaken-us.html), [McCain](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/29/vladimir-putin-is-bigger-threat-than-isis-john-mccain-says) among others used the "[red scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare)" tactics to advance them selfs politically.
1.1.5.3.1.8. Pro: President Obama proved comparably weak, potentially even underhanded, through his dealings with Russia.
1.1.5.3.1.8.1. Pro: President Obama allowed Russia to [annex Crimea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation).
1.1.5.3.1.8.1.1. Con: The only alternative would have been to oppose Russia with military force, which might cause a global conflict akin to a "WWIII".
1.1.5.3.1.8.1.2. Con: Russia never asked anyone for permission to invade another country. They just did it.
1.1.5.3.1.8.2. Pro: President Obama allowed alleged [Russian interference](http://Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections) in the US election. Rather than taking decisive action, all President Obama did before the election was to [privately ask Putin to stop](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/15/629281975/fact-check-did-the-obama-administration-respond-to-election-interference-by-russ), apparently to no avail, demonstrating his weakness.
1.1.5.3.1.8.2.1. Con: President Trump also allowed alleged Russian interference in the US election. In fact, he took the decisive action of [publicly](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/13/politics/trump-asked-russians-to-get-clinton-emails-they-immediately-started-trying-/index.html) [asking](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) [Putin](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-asked-russia-to-find-clintons-emails-on-or-around-the-same-day-russians-targeted-her-accounts) [to hack](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) the [DNC servers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/russia-hack-clinton-emails-mueller-probe-indictment-trump-latest-a8446626.html) \([which the Russians promptly did](http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-emails-hack-clinton-same-day-mueller-2018-7?r=US&IR=T)\).
1.1.5.3.1.8.2.2. Con: Such effective means of hacking elections via social media influence were completely unforeseen by anyone in the federal government, much less President Obama.
1.1.5.3.1.8.2.3. Con: Criticism of voting machine security had been [raised for years](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/24/us/computer-voting-is-open-to-easy-fraud-experts-say.html) before President Obama.
1.1.5.3.1.8.2.3.1. Con: Voting machine security is irrelevant to the 2016 election as there was no allegation that votes were tampered with.
1.1.5.3.1.8.2.3.1.1. Con: This question of whether votes were actually tampered with is unknowable. [22 states were targeted by Russia](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/electronic-voting-state-hacking-russian-government-cyber-actors/), and some were likely breached.
1.1.5.3.1.8.2.3.2. Con: President Obama was in a position of power and authority to implement and oversee changes and improvements to voting machine security and did nothing throughout the 8 years of his presidency.
1.1.5.3.1.8.3. Pro: President Obama's public rhetoric on Russia was tough, but in private he "secretly cooperated" with [Russia](https://www.wsj.com/video/obama-medvedev-hot-mic-gaffe/5F7CF09D-CFD5-4805-A72C-3378D5F8371E.html) by implying that he would make concessions after his re-election due to the additional "flexibility" he would have once he was no longer accountable to the public.
1.1.5.3.1.8.3.1. Con: This is an overstatement. [Obama offered no concessions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-summit-obama-medvedev/obama-tells-russias-medvedev-more-flexibility-after-election-idUSBRE82P0JI20120326), but simply asked for space, as it was "an election year in both countries \[...\] clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough".
1.1.5.3.1.8.4. Con: What Obama did or didn't do has no bearing on whether Trump was a good President, unless one wants to define President Trump by Obama's actions.
1.1.5.3.1.8.4.1. Pro: This is [what-about-ism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/whataboutism-origin-meaning).
1.1.5.3.1.8.4.2. Pro: We would need quantitative data to make a useful comparison; e.g. how many sanctions, how many Russian oligarchs hurt, how much Russian money affected.
1.1.5.3.1.8.5. Con: Russia cyber-attacked the US because of Obama's sanctions. We are still in the midst of Obama's tough stance on Russia.
1.1.5.3.1.8.5.1. Pro: President Obama worked with Europe to place sanctions on Russia after it invaded Crimea, President Trump [tried to lift them](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-wanted-to-lift-russia-sanctions-days-after-taking-office-2017-6).
1.1.5.3.1.9. Con: President Trump resisted placing sanctions on Russia even when they were passed and pushed for by Congress and the Senate.
1.1.5.3.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.8.5.1.
1.1.5.3.1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.10. Con: President Trump's friendliness with Putin was [not a good thing](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/17/17577476/trump-putin-meeting-intelligence-win).
1.1.5.3.2. Con: President Trump destroyed [US foreign policy due to his lack of diplomacy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/31/trump-destruction-foreign-policy/).
1.1.5.3.3. Con: President Trump [didn't have knowledge on international affairs](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-foreign-policy-gaffes-2016-213345).
1.1.5.3.4. Pro: President Trump moved the US [Embassy to Jerusalem](http://uk.businessinsider.com/us-embassy-move-to-jerusalem-trump-fulfills-promise-2018-5?r=US&IR=T); which was a bold move to strengthen America's standing globally.
1.1.5.3.4.1. Con: The US embassy move was a [personal decision](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/10/opinions/five-myths-jerusalem-embassy-move-miller/index.html) by President Trump that had less to do with governance of the USA and more to do with reelection.
1.1.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: President Trump named Jared Kushner \(whose family had strong ties to Israel\) as his [senior adviser](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/18/donald-trumps-new-world-order) to the president, to favour with those who supported Jewish or Israel’s interests.
1.1.5.3.4.2. Pro: Moving the [US embassy to Jerusalem](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-diplomacy-jerusalem-explai/why-is-the-u-s-moving-its-embassy-to-jerusalem-idUSKBN1I811N) allowed other countries to follow and recognize the capital.
1.1.5.3.4.2.1. Con: Neither of these acts have increased the US's standing in the world. For a great part of the world it was considered [controversial](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/14/17340798/jerusalem-embassy-israel-palestinians-us-trump).
1.1.5.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Controversy does not affect whether an act is positive or negative in the medium to long term.
1.1.5.3.4.3. Pro: Moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem shows that the US was truly [committed to peace](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/12/27/should-the-us-embassy-be-moved-from-tel-aviv-to-jerusalem/moving-the-embassy-to-jerusalem-shows-that-the-us-is-committed-to-peace) in Jerusalem - there would be no reason to place US ambassadors in jeopardy otherwise.
1.1.5.3.4.3.1. Pro: [Moving the US Embassy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-diplomacy-jerusalem-explai-idUSKBN1I811N)(The United States opens its new embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, a move that has delighted Israel and infuriated Palestinians.) meant that it was no longer a point of contention in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.
1.1.5.3.4.3.1.1. Con: Moving the US embassy to Jerusalem meant that the US was no longer seen as neutral or a good faith actor by the Palestinians, which only served to heighten and inflame tensions between the countries. [There is an argument that this move just removed any façade of neutrality.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/13/for-palestinians-america-was-never-an-honest-broker-israel-abbas-netanyahu-middle-east-peace-process/)
1.1.5.3.4.3.2. Con: In that case, it showed a fundamental misunderstanding, or complete lack of care and interest of the situation in Israel and of the grievances of the Palestinians.
1.1.5.3.4.4. Con: Moving the Israeli embassy was a [short-sighted policy](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-us-policy-israeli-palestinian-conflict) that perpetuates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict indefinitely and rules out the US as an objective broker in the peace process.
1.1.5.3.5. Pro: President Trump challenged China's [unfair trade practices](https://www.industryweek.com/trade/it-time-stand-china).
1.1.5.3.5.1. Con: President Trump frequently conducted trade with the Chinese, including [selling Trump-branded merchandise made in China](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-admits-gear-made-china-labels/story?id=13472355).
1.1.5.3.5.1.1. Con: The Trump-branded merchandise that was made in China was [probably unofficial](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/08/fact-check-trump-campaigns-official-maga-hats-made-america/5658106002/)(Our rating: Partly false\n\nThe claim in the post has been rated PARTLY FALSE. Official Trump campaign merchandise is made in the United States, which the website explicitly states. However, there is a market of unofficial Trump merchandise that is made in other countries and sold online and at rallies.). Official Trump-branded merchandise appears to be entirely made in the US.
1.1.5.3.5.2. Pro: President Trump stated in August 2019 that a "tough stance on China’s economic and trade policies would ultimately [benefit the American economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-idUSKCN1UX1WO)."
1.1.5.3.5.3. Con: China exploited the political divisions within the US during the Trump administration.
1.1.5.3.5.3.1. Pro: China signed the [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2021/05/28/china-missing-trump-terribly-as-biden-hits-hard-power/)(After Xi stopped popping champagne corks, Beijing signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. RCEP is a 15-nation grouping that puts China directly at the center of global supply chains—with the U.S. looking on from the sidelines.\n\nTrump was so easy for Xi to play. Xi knew Trump was so desperate for a splashy art-of-the-deal trade pact that China could have its way with Hong Kong, troll Taiwan and do what it wanted with Muslim minorities in the north-western Xinjiang region. Beijing curried Trumpian favor by lavishing a slew of China patents to first daughter Ivanka Trump.) during the Trump administration, which placed China at the centre of global supply chains.
1.1.5.3.5.4. Pro: President Trump's administration imposed tariffs worth more than [360 billion USD](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45899310)(Mr Trump's tariffs policy aims to encourage consumers to buy American products by making imported goods more expensive.\n\nThe US has imposed tariffs on more than $360bn \(£268bn\) of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products.\n\nWashington delivered three rounds of tariffs in 2018, and a fourth one in September last year. The most recent round targeted Chinese imports, from meat to musical instruments, with a 15% duty.\n\nBeijing hit back with tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on US goods.) on Chinese goods.
1.1.5.4. Pro: President Trump strengthened the US global environmental policy.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: President Trump's climate policies [accelerated global warming](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/oct/20/trump-us-dirtier-planet-warmer-75-ways).
1.1.5.4.2. Pro: President Trump withdrew from the [Iran Deal](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17326650/iran-nuclear-deal-withdraw-trump-speech-goldberg-interview).
1.1.5.4.2.1. Con: President Trump [withdrew](https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/insane-and-ill-advised-trumps-future-war-with-iran-part-1/) from the Iran deal, a deal that was ensuring Iran would not get a nuclear weapon. It was one of the most ill-advised and unnecessary moves in a long time.
1.1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Iran's nuclear program is a [threat to the peace and stability of the region](https://www.e-ir.info/2014/09/04/the-iranian-nuclear-programme-impact-on-regional-stability-and-security/), so President Trump's [withdrawal from the Iran Deal and economic sanctions](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-withdrawal-iran-nuclear-deal-has-been-vindicated-ncna1003091) were a good foreign policy decision.
1.1.5.4.2.3. Con: Withdrawing from the Iran deal has [primarily negative consequences for the USA \(and the world\)](https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/05/the-strategic-fallout-of-us-withdrawal-from-the-iran.html).
1.1.5.4.2.4. Con: Withdrawing from the Iran Deal has provided hardliners in the Iranian government more leverage against the USA by confirming their position that the United States can't be trusted to honor any agreement.
1.1.5.4.3. Pro: President Trump withdrew from the [Paris Climate Deal](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), which [benefited the USA financially](https://www.atr.org/obamas-paris-agreement-all-cost-and-no-benefit-us).
1.1.5.4.3.1. Con: Financial benefits will only matter for so much time until we all die.
1.1.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: A good President has to provide for the future stability and well being of the country and future generations, for long term stability and survival, not just immediate benefits regardless of costs or consequences in the future.
1.1.5.4.3.2. Con: Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement has primarily negative consequences for the USA.
1.1.5.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #15487: The US should not have pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement
1.1.5.4.3.3. Pro: This saved the US billions of dollars in trying to stop the [unstoppable](http://theconversation.com/if-we-stopped-emitting-greenhouse-gases-right-now-would-we-stop-climate-change-78882) and allowed it to focus on more practical things like space research and [escaping to Mars](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/there-s-only-one-way-for-humanity-to-survive--go-to-mars-/).
1.1.5.4.3.3.1. Con: Even if escaping to Mars or elsewhere would have been a viable strategy, President Trump's propositions of [cutting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/03/12/trumps-plan-to-destroy-nasa-science-laid-bare-in-fy2020-budget/#1aeb531d5818) NASA's budget showed no interest in supporting such a strategy.
1.1.5.4.3.3.2. Con: The original article referenced doesn't say it was unstoppable or unavoidable, only that the target was unrealistic. It still argues, however, that we need to slow global warming to give ourselves more time to adapt and survive. The Paris accord, which President Trump unilaterally withdrew from, was a step in that direction, to buy time for future generations.
1.1.5.4.3.3.3. Con: Escaping to Mars is not feasible with current technology and likely will remain so for many decades.
1.1.5.4.3.3.4. Con: Migrating a large founder population \(to avoid inbreeding depression\) to another planet \(or a even a space station in Earth orbit\) is not technically feasible at the present time. Such a task would involve intractable social and political problems as well \(who escapes; who is left behind\).
1.1.5.4.3.4. Con: The United States, like all other countries in the agreement, was able to set its own goals, and decide the value of its fines for not reaching said goals. Pulling out of the agreement was a symbolic move against global cooperation towards mitigating future risk.
1.1.5.4.3.4.1. Pro: An ounce in prevention is worth a ton in reaction.
1.1.5.5. Con: President Trump's [immigration policies](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1049751/download) have caused human rights abuses.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: There is no evidence that President Trump's policies were any more brutal, inhumane, or racially motivated than [Obama's](http://uk.businessinsider.com/migrant-children-in-cages-2014-photos-explained-2018-5), given that Obama isolated children from their parents and kept those children in cages. President Trump was simply [more effective](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ice-deportation-arrests-soar-under-trump-administration-drop-border-arrests-n826596) at dealing with people who had criminally entered the country.
1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: Obama and Trump [did not](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/19/matt-schlapp/no-donald-trumps-separation-immigrant-families-was/) have the same policies.
1.1.5.5.1.2. Con: President Trump also [separated](https://www.aclu.org/cases/ms-l-v-ice) families who entered the country legally.
1.1.5.5.1.3. Con: At least this claim accepts the inhumanity. But it doesn't dispel it.
1.1.5.5.2. Con: President Trump showed his support of human rights when stuck up for the oppressed citizens of foreign countries and was a promoter of their culture \(like [Iranians](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/11/trump-iran-protesters-tweets-097554)\).
1.1.5.5.2.1. Pro: He has shown the strength of the USA against [China](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/29/trump-pompeo-china-security/) and with his backing, Asian countries being [bullied by China](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/02/27/asian-countries-are-learning-to-cope-with-chinese-bullying) will [keep their sovereignty](https://www.orfonline.org/research/from-pivot-to-asia-to-trumps-aria-what-drives-the-us-current-asia-policy-61556/). He was a good president that could keep the image of a strong America.
1.1.5.5.3. Pro: President Trump's attempts to reduce both [legal](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/07/politics/legal-immigrants-daca-trump/index.html) and [illegal](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/05/08/report-says-trumps-immigration-crackdown-breeding-climate-fear) immigration appeared [inhumane](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/10/usa-treatment-of-asylum-seekers-southern-border/), and clearly [racially motivated](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/6/19/17478970/trump-family-separation-immigration-policy-racism), to the degree that it was liable to have [a damaging impact](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/09/trumps-crackdown-on-legal-immigration-is-hurting-america.html) on America's future.
1.1.5.5.3.1. Con: President Trump's immigration crackdown was more likely motivated by a desire to enforce the law, which is a core duty of the President. Certainly, this was what President Trump repeatedly [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-acting-enforce-law-keeping-families-together/).
1.1.5.5.3.1.1. Con: President Trump family separation policy was actually [against](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/world/americas/us-un-migrant-children-families.html) the law.
1.1.5.5.3.1.2. Con: If we knew President Trump's motivation, this would be a strong claim; however, motivation is a difficult thing to discern a priori, and we didn't know President Trump's motivation.
1.1.5.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: Moreover, [we cannot believe what he said](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) most of the time, so his documented statements are of little use in determining what his motivations were.
1.1.5.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.
1.1.5.5.3.3. Con: The crackdown on immigration from certain countries with significant internal problems linked with terrorism was [ruled constitutional](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44619976) in 2018, and so it was neither inhumane nor racist.
1.1.5.5.3.3.1. Con: Under President Trump, the US took the [unprecedented step](https://secondnexus.com/news/geraldo-rivera-tear-gas-fox-news/?spot_im_reply_id=sp_8fvGl692_48092_c_14tpDX_r_hqWpqT&utm_spot=sp_8fvGl692&utm_source=SpotIM&utm_medium=E-mail&utm_content=liked-message) of firing tear gas, a chemical weapon, on an unarmed civilian refugee column, composed of a high percentage of women and children, across a border, onto foreign soil.
1.1.5.5.3.3.2. Con: If a policy is ruled as constitutional, it does not actually mean that it can't be racist or inhumane.
1.1.5.5.3.3.2.1. Pro: Upon constitutional founding, black people were worth [3/5ths](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/three-fifths-clause-united-states-constitution-1787) of a person. Many policies after the civil war have continued to either outright discriminate, or have been used overtly in discriminatory fashion.
1.1.5.5.3.3.3. Pro: The Constitution [protects human rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_United_States), and so for it to be ruled Constitutional meant that it was not an abuse of human rights.
1.1.5.5.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.5.3.5. Pro: The impact of his '[zero-tolerance](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/16/qa-trump-administrations-zero-tolerance-immigration-policy)(new “zero-tolerance” policy intended to ramp-up criminal prosecution of people caught entering the United States illegally.)' policy, with increased levels of familial separation and unacceptable human rights abuses, was [very clear](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/my-son-is-not-the-same-new-testimony-paints-bleak-picture-of-family-separation)(The motion filed Monday came with more than 900 pages of declarations that included powerful personal testimonies from parents, children and other family members who were directly impacted by the Trump policy. It also included declarations from the state attorneys general offices, elected representatives, advocates and child and immigration experts who have dealt with families separated at the border.).
1.1.5.5.3.5.1. Con: The clear impact is that America is slowly but surely stemming the flow of criminals into the country \([p. 1](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2017/iceEndOfYearFY2017.pdf)(The EO and implementation memorandum expanded ICE’s enforcement focus to include removable aliens who \(1\) have been convicted of any criminal offense; \(2\) have been charged with any criminal offense that has not been resolved; \(3\) have committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense; \(4\) have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter before a governmental agency; \(5\) have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; \(6\) are subject to a final order of removal but have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or \(7\) in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security. The Department has directed that classes or categories of removable aliens are no longer exempted from potential enforcement.)\).
1.1.5.5.3.5.1.1. Con: The numbers shown are [actually lower than previous years.](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/ero/pdf/2013-ice-immigration-removals.pdf) This means that the policies are having no noticeable or observable effect and that if anything, the previous administration could take the credit.
1.1.5.5.3.6. Pro: President Trump made [false and misleading claims](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/trumps-chain-migration-fable/) about [chain migration](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/29/16504272/chain-migration-family-how-trump-end)(“Chain migration” is the technical name for a commonsense idea: People are more likely to move where their relatives are.).
1.1.5.5.3.6.1. Con: Chain immigration claims may have been exaggerated, but they were basically correct. The idea of having a lottery to let people into a country is questionable and President Trump was right to criticise it.
1.1.5.5.3.7. Pro: President Trump signed an executive order for a travel ban that [prohibited entry from seven countries](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court-decision-countries-map/)(Why are these countries being restricted?\n\nThe administration has cited poor cooperation with U.S. officials, terrorist activity and technical hurdles to properly document their own travelers as reasons for the latest iteration of the ban. While the text of the order does not mention religion, critics say the policy reflects anti-Muslim prejudice — with North Korea and Venezuela added as window dressing.), five of which were majority Muslim, for national security reasons. These countries never posed a national security threat to the US
1.1.5.5.3.7.1. Pro: None of the [deadly terrorist attackers](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/who-are-terrorists/) have been from the countries that were banned by this order.
1.1.5.5.3.7.2. Pro: The list of countries with the imposed travel ban [didn't include](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/) Muslim majority countries in which President Trump had historical or current business ties.
1.1.5.5.3.7.3. Con: President Trump stated that the travel ban was only temporary and that the US would resume issuing visas to these countries once ["the most secure policies"](https://www.rferl.org/a/28264371.html)(U.S. President Donald Trump has defended his executive order to temporarily halt travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, insisting it was "not a Muslim ban."\n\nTrump said on January 29 that the United States would resume issuing visas to all countries once "the most secure policies" were in place.\n\nVowing to protect the country from "foreign terrorists," Trump signed an executive order on January 27 halting the entire U.S. refugee program for 120 days, indefinitely banning Syrian refugees, and suspending all immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days.) were in place.
1.1.5.5.4. Pro: President Trump reversed his [zero-tolerance policy in 2018](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gop-leaders-voice-hope-that-bill-addressing-family-separations-will-pass-thursday/2018/06/20/cc79db9a-7480-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html).
1.1.5.6. Pro: President Trump was not a warmonger. He made clear that [he didn't want a nuclear confrontation](https://www.newparadigmsforum.com/p2117) and didn't [react hastily](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/16/president-donald-trump-says-getting-along-with-russia-is-a-good-thing.html) to provocative actions made by other nations.
1.1.5.6.1. Con: Stating an opposition to nuclear war should not be considered a "foreign policy achievement." It should be considered standard messaging.
1.1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Even if not being a warmonger, not wanting nuclear confrontation, and not reacting hastily to provocative actions of other nations could be seen as positive traits in a President, it doesn't prove that Trump was a good President with foreign policy success.
1.1.5.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.2.1.
1.1.5.6.1.3. Con: Since there have been so many "[nuclear war close calls](https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons-risk)", it is important for a President to publicly state his opposition to it.
1.1.5.6.2. Con: President Trump's escalation of war in several countries led to the [unnecessary deaths](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/22/civilian-casualties-soared-in-iraq-and-syria-in-2017-was-trumps-bloodthirsty-rhetoric-to-blame/) of thousands of civilians, far more than during the Obama administration.
1.1.5.6.2.1. Pro: President Trump ordered an [illegal](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/1/3/was-trumps-order-to-assassinate-irans-qassem-soleimani-legal) [act of war](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/was-it-legal-donald-trump-order-killing-top-iranian-general-n1109961) when the US killed [Qassem Soleimani](https://apnews.com/article/5597ff0f046a67805cc233d5933a53ed).
1.1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: This prompted Iran to [send missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Iranian_attack_on_U.S._forces_in_Iraq) at US bases in Iraq; the first time there has been direct military engagement between Iran and the US since 1979.
1.1.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: After being asked to withdraw troops by Abdul Mahdi, President Trump further escalated matters by refusing, threatening Iraq with sanctions that would ["make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame"](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/06/trump-threatens-to-slap-sanctions-on-iraq-like-theyve-never-seen-before.html) and demanding reimbursement for American investments in Iraqi military facilities.
1.1.5.6.2.1.3. Pro: President Trump ordered an illegal act by assassinating an official of a neutral country in the airport of an ally and causing the deaths of allied officials as collateral damage, according to [Iran's foreign minister](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/soleimani-killing-iran-zarif-vows-response-act-war-200107120523488.html), [the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-us-assassinated-suleimani-the-chief-exporter-of-irans-revolution-but-at-what-price), and the [Iranian ambassador](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iranian-ambassador-to-un-says-soleimani-death-an-act-of-war/).
1.1.5.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: President Trump violated [several long-standing, unofficial policies](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boris-johnson-iran-crisis-trump-soleimani-us-middle-east-a9272321.html). This was [unlikely to boost](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-soleimani-assassination-a-view-from-britain/) [America's image](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/qassem-soleimani-boris-johnson-britain-iraq-iran/604582/) or [make allies likely](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trump-disregards-canada-allies-with-killing-of-iranian-general-ex-ambassador-1.4756046) to [trust or cooperate](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-allies-response-trump-iran-qasem-soleimani-attack-alone-world-2020-1) with America in the future.
1.1.5.6.2.2. Pro: [President Trump directed the killing of Soleimani, Iranian Major General](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/02/793208096/iraqi-tv-says-top-iranian-military-leader-killed-in-rocket-strikes-on-iraqi-airp) "akin to Iran assassinating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \[as\] an act of war". President Trump greatly destabilized the region and increased the threat of war.
1.1.5.6.2.3. Pro: President Trump [sold billions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-weapons-armaments-yemen-civil-war-a8265821.html) of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, one of the [most repressive regimes in the world](https://theconversation.com/saudi-arabia-is-a-repressive-regime-and-so-are-a-lot-of-us-allies-105106). The Saudis were using these weapons to [obliterate Yemen](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-11-30/us-help-saudi-arabia-obliterating-yemen) in a conflict that was more a massacre than a war.
1.1.5.6.2.4. Con: [US military forces were at war](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-at-war/) for all eight years of Obama’s tenure.
1.1.5.6.2.5. Con: Obama ordered [unjustified drone attacks in Pakistan and Yemen.](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/21/rights-groups-sayobamasdroneprogramviolatesinternationallaw.html)
1.1.5.6.3. Pro: President Trump dramatically lowered tensions with North Korea.
1.1.5.6.3.1. Con: President Trump stated in a speech to the UN “if \[the U.S.\] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to [totally destroy North Korea](https://time.com/4949546/north-korea-trump-history-nuclear-threats/).” It is hard to imagine a more extreme response than his stated intention.
1.1.5.6.3.2. Pro: North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon since [September 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).
1.1.5.6.3.2.1. Con: They just had some kind of [problem with their test site](http://www.theguardian.com).
1.1.5.6.3.3. Pro: North Korea was engaged in negotiations and dialogue with the US, exchanging [very warm letters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/north-koreas-kim-asks-trump-for-another-meeting-in-new-letter-idUSKCN1LQ2E3) between the two leaders.
1.1.5.6.3.3.1. Con: The fact that President Trump seemed on close terms with a known dictator wasn't necessarily a good thing. Many could have perceived this as dangerous or alarming.
1.1.5.6.3.4. Pro: North Korean media has [toned down](https://www.ft.com/content/82df7074-7522-11e8-aa31-31da4279a601) anti-US rhetoric.
1.1.5.6.3.5. Pro: President Trump [halted](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/trump-says-no-reason-for-military-exercises-with-south-korea-despite-stalled-nuke-talks-with-north.html) provocative military exercises with South Korea.
1.1.5.6.3.5.1. Con: President [Trump did so unilaterally without consulting South Korea](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-agreed-cancel-south-korea-war-games-without-informing-military-972322). [Much](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/12/us-to-suspend-war-games-with-south-korea-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-summit) to the [consternation](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/trump-us-military-war-games-south-korea-intl/index.html) of [South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html) and [Japan](https://www.stripes.com/news/mattis-reassures-japan-that-alliance-is-firm-amid-concerns-over-canceled-war-games-1.535335), [two](https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/tokyo-concerned-over-trump-cancellation-of-war-games-1.739710) of America's [traditional](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/u-s-south-korea-military-drills-are-vital-japans-defense-chief.html) [allies](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/30/national/japan-bothered-ramifications-u-s-halt-korean-war-games/), somewhat [straining](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/in-surprise-summit-concession-trump-says-he-will-halt-korea-war-games-idUSKBN1J72PM) relationships with them.
1.1.5.6.3.5.1.1. Con: South Korea deviated from a common US-Japan-SK line first when they [invited the North to the Olympics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/south-korea-invites-north-korea-to-cooperate-on-olympics/2018/01/02/61d4f42c-e110-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b5a918e970e7) in spring 2018.
1.1.5.6.3.5.2. Con: President Trump's stated reasoning was often inconsistent and at times contradictory: with regards to North Korea and war games in South Korea, he himself indicated it was for [economic reasons](http://time.com/5309627/president-trump-why-war-games-end/), not just, or possibly even primarily, diplomatic ones.
1.1.5.6.3.5.2.1. Con: President Trump also stated that it was because they were provocative: "[We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money because number one I think it’s very provocative. I want to do it and I think they’re \[North Korea\] very happy about it because it is so provocative](https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/singapore-trump-says-he-will-halt-us-south-korea-war-games).”
1.1.5.6.3.6. Pro: North Korea [returned three US hostages](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles/three-americans-freed-by-north-korea-head-home-thank-trump-idUSKBN1IA08I), who thanked President Trump for their safe return.
1.1.5.6.3.6.1. Pro: In 2018, North Korea [returned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44976947) the remains of US soldiers slain in the Korean war.
1.1.5.6.3.6.2. Con: They also tortured [Otto Warmbier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Warmbier) to death and transferred him out of their custody only for him to die within days.
1.1.5.6.3.6.2.1. Con: This is [highly disputed](https://www.axios.com/otto-warmbier-north-korea-torture-death-09de0093-0412-448c-8216-670103f98646.html).
1.1.5.6.3.7. Con: South Korea took the first steps to lower tensions.
1.1.5.6.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.6.3.5.1.1.
1.1.5.6.3.8. Con: North Korea [continued to develop](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45067681) nuclear weapons violating UN sanctions.
1.1.5.6.3.8.1. Pro: North Korea was showing [no signs](https://www.38north.org/2018/06/yongbyon062618/) of slowing down its nuclear plans, despite President Trump's claims that North Korea was [no longer a threat](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/trump-says-north-korea-no-longer-a-nuclear-threat.html).
1.1.5.6.3.8.1.1. Con: North Korea was still in negotiations, so it did not make sense for them to give up their ace card - namely their nuclear programme - until the negotiations were complete.
1.1.5.6.3.8.1.1.1. Con: The negotiations [have been ended](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/pompeo-north-korea-trip.html).
1.1.5.6.3.8.1.2. Pro: North Korea still posed a serious threat, as evidenced by [Trump's U-turn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44584957) regarding North Korea, going from "There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea" \(which was patently untrue\) to [extending the state of national emergency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/notice-regarding-continuation-national-emergency-respect-north-korea/) in place regarding North Korea. President Trump has achieved very little despite his statements to the contrary.
1.1.5.6.3.8.2. Pro: National Security Adviser [John Bolton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/north-korea-has-not-taken-steps-to-denuclearize-john-bolton-says/2018/08/07/9a560ac0-9a51-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html) claims that North Korea has taken [no steps](https://thebulletin.org/2018/07/north-korea-is-not-denuclearizing-yet/) towards de-nuclearization.
1.1.5.6.3.8.2.1. Pro: There is [intelligence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/north-korea-making-bomb-fuel-despite-denuclearization-pledge-pompeo-idUSKBN1KF2QT) to suggest that North Korea is [continuing](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/if-north-korea-denuclearizing-why-it-expanding-nuclear-research-center-n887056) [to make fuel](https://qz.com/1344277/north-korea-working-on-new-missiles-despite-denuclearization-pledge/) for nuclear weapons.
1.1.5.6.3.8.2.2. Pro: [Experts](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-07-27/denuclearization-not-going-happen-says-north-korea-expert) [do not believe](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/politics/north-korea-denuclearization/index.html) N.Korea will [de-nuclearize](http://www.atimes.com/article/time-to-get-real-north-korea-will-not-denuclearize/).
1.1.5.6.3.9. Con: According to some experts, President Trump [made the situation worse](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/27/north-korea-us-now-worse-off-than-before-trump-kim-summit---expert.html) with North Korea.
1.1.5.6.3.10. Con: The tensions between North Korea and South Korea \(and the US\) eased because of [North Korea's newfound leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEoZLGHKvy8&t=410s), not because of President Trump's negotiation tactics, or name-calling strategy.
1.2. Pro: President Trump was a proponent and protector of [free speech in the US](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/e-lessons/freedom-of-speech-general).
1.2.1. Con: President Trump frequently [attacked the press](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/trump-attacks-media-dangerously-undermine-truth-cpj-200416165039696.html).
1.2.1.1. Con: President Trump called out and criticized [cancel culture](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/cancel-culture-obama-new-york-times-trump-free-speech-20191104.html) and the [political correctness](https://www.nytimes.com/live/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland/trump-on-political-correctness/) of [the press](https://www.cjr.org/criticism/political-correctness-journalism.php).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: President Trump attacked cancel culture but he [also used it during his presidency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/09/06/trump-attacks-cancel-culturebut-tried-recently-to-cancel-these-people/?sh=4e18e37d4b2a).
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: President Trump rightly criticized cancel culture, as it represented a kind of censorship that could have become a [threat to social justice](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cancel-culture-censorship-can-be-most-dangerous-those-who-promote-ncna1235671).
1.2.1.2. Pro: When President Trump attacked the press, he was directly [attacking the American Constitution](https://theconversation.com/when-trump-attacks-the-press-he-attacks-the-american-people-and-their-constitution-139863) and the [freedom of the press](https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/freedom-press).

1.2.1.2.3. Con: When President Trump attacked the press he was exercising his [freedom of expression](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-10-freedom-expression).
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Freedom of expression is [not absolute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/freedom-expression/compsum.php).
1.2.1.3. Pro: Donald Trump used legal threats and actions to intimidate journalists who were critical of him.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Trump sued Timothy O'Brien for his reporting on Trump's wealth. Trump subsequently admitted that he only did so to "[make his life miserable](https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/282994-why-we-need-a-free-speech-law-to-stop-trump-style)(In his book "TrumpNation," reporter Timothy O'Brien estimated that real estate mogul and now-presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump was vastly overstating his net worth. In response, Trump sued O'Brien for libel and sought $5 billion in damages. While the courts ultimately dismissed the case for lacking merit, Trump said that he knew the lawsuit would fail but sued anyway. "I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which I'm happy about." Trump is not alone in using lawsuits, or the threat of lawsuits, to silence critics. Indeed, this has become such a problem in the United States that it is time for Congress to intervene, so that the court system does not merely become a tool to silence free speech among those who would speak out against powerful individuals and businesses.)".
1.2.1.4. Pro: President Trump has undermined the public's [trust in the press](https://news.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx)(WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' trust and confidence in the mass media "to report the news fully, accurately and fairly" has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year.) when the press provides a general public service by reporting on relevant and current events.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: President Trump insisted that journalists were "[the enemy of the people](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437610-trump-calls-press-the-enemy-of-the-people/)(The press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They can’t stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!\n\n — Donald J. Trump \(\@realDonaldTrump\) April 5, 2019)" and popularized the phrase "[fake news](https://www.apnews.com/bc8b3670f9284186ac9a2699566b9baf)", thus deeply corroding the confidence in an age-old American institution.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: President Trump attacked mainstream outlets as “enemies of the people” while he championed flattering coverage, such as the [One America News Network \(OAN\)](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/15/oan-oann-fox-news-donald-trump)("The president rewards OAN with shout-outs and access wildly out of sync with its reach, leading some observers to suspect that he is playing OAN and Fox News off one another to ensure their undying affection.").
1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: In a democracy, [fake news exists](https://www.routledge.com/Post-Truth-Fake-News-and-Democracy-Mapping-the-Politics-of-Falsehood/Farkas-Schou/p/book/9780367322175), and President Trump should have been allowed to call out on what he perceived as fake news.
1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Con: As a President of a democratic society, President Trump should have respected [media freedom](https://freedomhouse.org/issues/media-freedom) and an independent, pluralistic media.
1.2.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Calling out fake news is better than living in an [autocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy)(Autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power over a state is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control.), with no news and no freedom of speech.
1.2.1.4.1.3. Con: President Trump said that ["fake news" was the enemy of the people](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/413764-trump-dishonest-to-say-i-called-all-media-enemy-of-the-people). He didn't call all media the enemy of the people.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: President Trump stated at a rally in Florida in 2018 that a third of Americans believed that fake news was "[the enemy of the people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46053036)".
1.2.1.4.1.3.2. Con: President Trump also stated that 'fake news' was any news about him that he [disliked, disagreed with, or was otherwise negative about him.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/9/17335306/trump-tweet-twitter-latest-fake-news-credentials)
1.2.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: [Fox News’s Chris Wallace](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/coverage-trump-presidency-2020-election.php)(“Even if Trump is trying to undermine the press for his own calculated reasons,” Wallace said, “when he talks about bias in the media—unfairness—I think he has a point.”), who received an award for excellence in journalism in 2017, stated that when President Trump talked "about bias in the media", he had a point.
1.2.1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: An organization or individual, belonging to the media, was only able to dodge the designation of "fake news" if they were in [regular private communication with the president, to ensure their messaging was beneficial to President Trump.](https://www.politico.eu/blogs/on-media/2018/07/sean-hannity-wins-as-donald-trumps-lone-defender-fox-news/)
1.2.1.4.2. Con: Press organisations that create [news for ratings and sensationalism](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-u-s-medias-problems-are-much-bigger-than-fake-news-and-filter-bubbles) are not performing a public service.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: To paint all major media outlets with a broad brush is dangerously misguided.
1.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Not all news sources are equally good. Some have more professional staff and are less dependent on monetary incentives than others.
1.2.1.4.3.2. Pro: Media outlets' can be [biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias#Scholarly_treatment_in_the_United_States_and_United_Kingdom) in both their content and coverage. They would push a narrative that supports a particular side or publish half-truth or otherwise unequivocally false, details on stories that would push either sides' narrative. This goes against the goal of any good media organization, which is to publish unbiased coverage and factual content.
1.2.1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.1.3.2.2.
1.2.1.4.4. Con: There are certain news organizations that spin content regarding the President in a biased light, which portrays an unflattering depiction of the President. He had a right to call out unfair content, or coverage of him.
1.2.1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.3.2.
1.2.1.4.4.2. Con: The President does have a right to call out half-truth content, but to portray the publishers of factual stories, based on the narrative of their coverage, as "fake news" sets a dangerous precedent.
1.2.1.4.4.3. Pro: Many mainstream sources pushed the narrative that the President called illegal/undocumented immigrants "animals".
1.2.1.4.4.3.1. Con: President Trump was consistently careless \(or deliberately ambiguous\) with the objects of his accusations.
1.2.1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Personal opinions are not what are asked of a president. His reasoning should be supported by evidences.
1.2.1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: While making an argument against immigration, he usually talked about [MS-13](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/07/trump-keeps-warning-about-ms-13-is-it-really-as-dangerous-as-he-suggests/) and started to hurling insults using pronouns, which is a common tactic to bring emotional heat into a discussion.
1.2.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Many popular [news sources](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170301-lies-propaganda-and-fake-news-a-grand-challenge-of-our-age) don't specify the context in their titles, in a day and age when most people skim the titles of the news and share without reading the article.
1.2.1.4.4.3.3. Con: It is still unacceptable to call any person an animal regardless of context.
1.2.1.4.4.3.4. Pro: This is an unfair depiction of the [context of his discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmT7-dhOWs), because he was referring to individuals under that subset that are in-and-out of the U.S. jail system, or repeat offenders.
1.2.1.4.4.3.5. Con: It's not hard to draw parallels from President Trump referring to immigrants as "[animals](https://lulac.org/news/pr/LULAC_Denounces_President_Trumps_Remarks_Calling_Undocumented_Immigrants_Animals/)" to Hitler calling Jews "[vermin](https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/image/when-vermin-are-dead-der-st-rmer-antisemitic-cartoon)" or the Hutus calling the Tutsis "[cockroaches](https://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/73836)" before those genocides. Even if Trump was using the term after MS-13 was mentioned, it's still a dangerous road to be on.
1.2.1.4.5. Pro: The press is an important check on both federal and local governments, as indicated by the inclusion of the [Freedom of the Press in the Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).
1.2.1.4.5.1. Pro: The backbone of any democracy is an [independent, professional and responsible media](https://blogs.fcdo.gov.uk/petermillett/2012/02/13/the-responsibility-of-the-press/). Their role is to inform, criticise and stimulate debate.
1.2.1.4.5.1.1. Con: Not if they are creating news for channel ratings. [CNN](https://www.air.tv/watch?v=AFX3nmoNSL2imnmsZ6E6IA) got caught, but so many others reposted [CNN's "news" as real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_controversies) and never clarified which "news" was fake.
1.2.1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Media and investigative reporting have an important role in [deepening democracy](http://www.changecommunications.org/docs/dib/dibengunpan010194.pdf)(Investigative reporting, which in some cases has led to the ouster of presidents and the fall of corrupt governments, has made the media an effective and credible watchdog and boosted its credibility among the public). \(p.1\)
1.2.1.4.5.2. Pro: Undermining the public's trust in the veracity and intentions of the press as a whole is an underhanded maneuver of censoring it.
1.2.1.4.5.3. Con: Criticism is not the same as censorship.
1.2.1.4.5.3.1. Con: When criticizing a group of people whose livelihoods have been built on their reputation for reporting factual information, censorship undermines the infrastructure of their industry and their bottom line. The media industry is built off of views and impressions of the content produced. When people don't trust you, they don't view your material. If this were to continue for much longer, it could systematically censor them by eliminating the means of producing the content they create.
1.2.1.4.6. Con: It is the press [that has undermined](https://www.poynter.org/news/not-fake-news-just-plain-wrong-top-media-corrections-2017) the public's trust.
1.2.1.4.6.1. Con: The verbal disparagement and [threats](https://firstamendmentwatch.org/deep-dive/the-alarming-rise-in-verbal-and-physical-threats-to-the-press/) President Trump levied against the free press were dangerous and promoted unconstitutional suppression of the press.
1.2.1.4.6.1.1. Pro: It should be the people's responsibility to be skeptical and seek the truth if they feel the mainstream media is being deceptive. The word of the President is a powerful thing; he should not have abused it.
1.2.1.4.6.1.2. Con: President Trump created the [Fake News Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_News_Awards) in 2018 to highlight misinformation provided by news outlets.
1.2.1.4.6.2. Pro: Media news is mostly politically-driven.
1.2.1.4.6.2.1. Con: Politics are important and the news media have an integral role in "[informing marginalized segments of the population about politics](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/14/eaay9344)."
1.2.1.4.6.2.2. Pro: Media coverage of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's current right-wing President, was in complete disregard of how his opposition [destroyed](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/01/bolsonaro-cant-destroy-brazilian-democracy/) the country in the past mandates.
1.2.1.4.6.2.2.1. Con: Giving politically-driven opinions is unavoidable in any media, and \(so long as those opinions are supported by accurate and properly-represented evidence\) entirely valid. To criticise Bolsonaro is a wholly seperate matter from supporting his opposition or disregarding their failings.
1.2.1.4.6.2.2.2. Con: The second article linked says nothing about Bolsonaro's opposition destroying the country, and is itself widely critical of Bolsonaro.
1.2.1.4.6.3. Pro: The press lost the public's trust without President Trump's help. He [called out](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39592010) the press for being biased and was [proven correct](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/social-media-trump-conservative-bias/).
1.2.1.4.6.3.1. Pro: There has always been [media bias](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/06/12/a_brief_history_of_media_bias_118781.html) and "yellow journalism", therefore criticism is often warranted.
1.2.1.4.6.3.2. Con: The tenuous relationship between the article and the claim explained that fake news was read and shared by both the right and the left, and it didn't seem to be 'primarily an issue of the uneducated' as some believed. Mostly it was just people reading things that they already supported and passing them on.
1.2.1.4.6.3.2.1. Pro: The supporting source makes a mention of facts whose meaning is subject to interpretation, but the article makes no attempt to offer alternative interpretations.
1.2.1.4.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: People working for Amazon give 90% of their donations to left leaning candidates, and 10% to right leaning candidates. The article implies this causes them to manipulate data towards the left. But they could be examining the data and moving to the left because of it.
1.2.1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro: The article claimed that "put another way, socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders raked in nearly half again as much as both Republican presidential nominees. So claims that the social media giants are politically neutral were a joke."
1.2.1.4.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: Sanders's campaign was [structured](https://www.ibtimes.com/how-bernie-sanders-changed-democratic-fundraising-beating-hillary-clintons-total-2379240) to encourage small donations from people so he didn't have to take money from [PACS](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate?id=N00000528), [unlike](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16) the presidential nominees. The fact that more people donated to him was to be expected.
1.2.1.4.6.3.3. Con: The cited articles are about social media, not about established media. The spread of fake news via social media is a problem, but the distrust of established media sources is partially due to the conflation of those sources with things that are seen on social media.
1.2.1.4.6.3.3.1. Pro: It is the equivalent of saying that it's CNN's own fault that people don't trust it, because of the articles it published in the National Enquirer.
1.2.2. Con: President Trump authorized the use of tear gas and rubber bullets on [peaceful protesters](https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/peaceful-protesters-were-attacked-as-trump-spoke-and-the-media-thankfully-was-there-to-shine-a-light-on-it/) fighting for justice for George Floyd on the 1st of June 2020.
1.2.3. Pro: An [executive order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/02/2020-12030/preventing-online-censorship)(Executive Order 13925 of May 28, 2020\n\nPreventing Online Censorship\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:) on preventing online censorship was released in May 2020.
1.2.3.1. Pro: President Trump stated his willingness to prevent the [online censorship of Twitter](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/02/2020-12030/preventing-online-censorship)(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.\n\nAs President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. It is essential to sustaining our democracy.) as the platform had a tendency to selectively "place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflected political bias."
1.2.3.2. Con: An order to prevent private companies from reducing the spread of misinformation is not a measure to protect "free speech" but a license to lie.
1.2.4. Con: President Trump severely [damaged the exercise of free speech](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/).
1.2.4.1. Pro: These concerns about "free speech" often seem to focus more on [protecting certain groups from any criticism](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/race-and-the-free-speech-diversion) rather than protecting the right broadly for all groups, in all cases.
1.2.4.2. Pro: President Trump's abuse of free speech [left America more vulnerable to disasters](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/05/01/destroying-trust-in-the-media-science-and-government-has-left-america-vulnerable-to-disaster/).
1.2.5. Con: President Trump used the [rhetoric of hate](https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2019/13/shsconf_appsconf2019_03038.pdf) during his presidency.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Much of the freedom President Trump advocated for opened the way for hate speech, racism, and toxic discourse.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: President Trump's senior campaign advisor and speechwriter used coded messages that referenced and allied with [white supremacy](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2020/07/01/482414/white-supremacy-returned-mainstream-politics/), as shown by his leaked emails.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: President Trump called COVID-19 the ["Chinese virus" and "Kung flu."](https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2020/06/22/wh-defends-trumps-use-kung-flu-rally/3238385001/)
1.2.5.1.3. Con: President Trump was honest in his fight against "[political correctness](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/12/14/505324427/politically-correct-the-phrase-has-gone-from-wisdom-to-weapon)".
1.2.5.1.4. Con: The problem wasn't that President Trump advocated for freedom, but that there were elements in society that misused it.
1.2.5.2. Con: Truly free speech allows people to openly voice any kind of opinion.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Free speech doesn't prohibit the consequences of abusing it.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: According to the [First Amendment](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does), freedom of speech doesn't include inciting "actions that would harm others."
1.2.5.2.3. Pro: Prohibiting specific opinions could lead to [censorship](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/896/censorship).
1.2.5.3. Pro: President Trump [weaponized free speech](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trump_shooting_looting_facebook_zuckerberg.php).
1.2.6. Pro: President Trump issued an executive order to [protect campus free speech](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/President-Trump-Issues-Executive-Order-on-Campus-Free-Speech.aspx) in March 2019.
1.2.6.1. Con: The order [didn't actually protect free speech](https://theconversation.com/what-president-trumps-executive-order-on-campus-free-speech-is-really-meant-to-do-114059), instead, it gave the order to the Department of Education to provide more "granular information about student debt and earnings on [the College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)."
1.2.6.2. Pro: The aim of this order was to [improve transparency on college campuses](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/campus-free-speech-executive-order-donald-trump/index.html)(Trump: If college won't let you speak, we won't give money.) by promoting free speech.
1.2.7. Pro: On May 4, 2017, President Trump signed the executive order "[Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoS-Implementation-of-Executive-Order-13798-508.pdf)" which gave greater freedom in political speech to religious organizations.
1.2.7.1. Pro: This executive order aimed at relaxing [political restrictions on religious groups of all denominations](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/04/526840823/annotated-trumps-executive-order-on-religious-liberty).
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: The executive order protected different entities by providing approximately [13.7 million people with health care and other social services](https://www.frc.org/executiveorder).
1.2.7.1.2. Con: The executive order licensed discrimination by using "[religious liberty to justify discrimination](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2017/07/31/436871/religious-liberty-executive-order-licenses-discrimination/)".
1.2.7.2. Con: The executive order gave more [freedom to churches in order to strenghen birth control restrictions](http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2017/05/04/trumps-new-order-political-freedom-churches-religion-back-table-deny-birth-control/).
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: This executive order was criticized for "[hurting women](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-religious-liberty-executive-order-allowing-broad-exemptions-n754786)("Plain and simple: President Trump’s executive order will hurt women," Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a statement. "And the Center for Reproductive Rights is ready to fight back in court.)".
1.2.7.2.2. Con: The executive order was signed with the idea of [defending the freedom of religion and speech in America](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-religious-liberty-order-to-defend-freedom-of-religion/).
1.3. Con: President Trump committed many [immoral actions](https://theintercept.com/2019/12/19/a-z-trump-impeachment/) - the character of a leader is of utmost importance.
1.3.1. Pro: President Trump's personal and professional lives were littered with a number of [serious moral failings](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/15/opinion/leonhardt-trump-racist.html) long before he became President.
1.3.1.1. Pro: President Trump was frequently involved in corrupt practices.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: President Trump evaded [hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html).
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: President Trump had a history of [buying influence from politicians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-bragged-that-his-money-bought-off-politicians-just-not-this-time/2016/09/07/00a9d1e4-750b-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html).
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: President Trump scammed thousands of people with his "[Trump University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University)".
1.3.1.2. Pro: President Trump was accused of many [sexual assault allegations](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-sexual-assault-allegations-all-list-misconduct-karen-johnson-how-many-a9149216.html).
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: President Trump is an [accused rapist](https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/).
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: At least 26 women have [accused](https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12)("A deluge of women made their accusations public following the October 2016 publication of the "Access Hollywood" tape, in which Trump was heard boasting about grabbing women's genitals in 2005.") President Trump of sexually harassing or assaulting them.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: Accusations are not proven. You cannot judge a "potential predator" as though he's an actual predator.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: None of these allegations have been proven.
1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Dozen of women have made [allegations of sexual misconduct](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-sexual-assault-allegations-all-list-misconduct-karen-johnson-how-many-a9149216.html) against President Trump.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: A book called "[All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the making of a predator](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-sexual-assault-allegations-all-list-misconduct-karen-johnson-how-many-a9149216.html)" detailed full 26 incidents of “unwanted sexual contact” and 43 instances of inappropriate behavior.
1.3.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: According to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/17/amy-dorris-donald-trump-women-who-accuse-sexual-misconduct)(The list of women who have publicly made sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump outnumbers the list of officials in his cabinet. Before today, no fewer than 25 women had made such accusations against Trump, ranging from harassment to sexual assault and rape.), "the list of women who have publicly made sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump outnumbers the list of officials in his cabinet."
1.3.1.2.3.1.2. Con: President Trump denied these harassment allegations and claimed they were "[motivated by attempts to sell](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-denies-sexual-assault-allegation/story?id=63895448)" the book.
1.3.1.2.3.2. Con: President Trump [denied](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54197250) all those allegations.
1.3.1.3. Con: Bill Clinton [did](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations) far [worse](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/bill-clinton-al-franken-sexual-harassment/index.html) in his personal and [professional](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43218355) life and yet many seem to think he was a good president.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Whether Bill Clinton did or didn't do far worse is irrelevant to the question in evaluating whether Trump was a good President or not.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Donald Trump is [racist](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/14/times-president-trump-comments-called-racist/985438002/).

Other officials added that she had weighed in on topics including climate, deportation, education and refugee policy.\n\n\[...\]\n\nMs. Trump, 35, a former model, entrepreneur and hotel developer, says she will focus on gender inequality in the United States and abroad, by aiming to create a federal paid leave program, more affordable child care and a global fund for women who are entrepreneurs, among other efforts. Her interest in gender issues grew out of a “Women Who Work” hashtag and marketing campaign she devised a few years ago to help sell $99 pumps and $150 dresses. On Tuesday, the career advice book she worked on before the election, whose title echoes her hashtag, was released.) to pursue more progressive policies. That President Trump kept her in a position of influence could be seen as evidence of his willingness to consider gender equality measures.
1.3.7.5. Pro: He had archaic views on abortion; while being anti-abortion is valid, his belief that there should be 'punishment' for women who have an abortion was deeply problematic - so much so that it caused him to [retract](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment) the statement in 2016.
1.3.7.5.1. Pro: He also had a hypocritical view on abortion because he used an [antibody treatment that was tested using cells originally derived from an abortion](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/07/1009664/trumps-antibody-treatment-was-tested-using-cells-from-an-abortion/).

1.3.8. Pro: President Trump and his associates were connected to a host of crimes.
1.3.8.1. Con: Every accusation against President Trump was 'alleged' and nothing was proven in court or otherwise.

1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: [Robert Stone](https://www.businessinsider.com/roger-stone-to-serve-40-months-on-seven-convictions-2020-2?r=US&IR=T)(A federal judge on Thursday sentenced Roger Stone, a longtime GOP strategist and Trump ally, to 40 months in prison.

1.3.8.1.1.2. Con: The fact that his associates committed crimes doesn't prove that President Trump participated in those crimes.
1.3.8.1.1.2.1. Con: It does, however, raise questions about President Trump's possible knowledge of and deliberate ignorance of these crimes.
1.3.8.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that a US President can [face criminal prosecution in court](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-us-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3).
1.3.8.2. Pro: Revelations published in January 2021, show that President Trump engaged in a [criminal conspiracy](https://www.justsecurity.org/66271/timeline-trump-giuliani-bidens-and-ukrainegate/).

1.3.8.3.1.1. Pro: The Moscow Project analyzed and found a long history of [business deals between President Trump and Putin](https://themoscowproject.org/)(How decades of Donald Trump's business dealings and Vladimir Putin's assault on Western democracy converged during the 2016 election cycle and beyond.).
1.3.8.3.1.1.1. Con: President Trump was a businessman dealing with many countries. Business deals with a country are not suspicious.
1.3.8.3.1.1.2. Con: The [Moscow Project](https://themoscowproject.org/) is an aggressively anti-Trump group.
1.3.8.3.1.2. Con: The FBI concluded that there was no [clear connection between President Trump and Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47688187).
1.3.8.3.2. Pro: Robert Muller’s [investigation](https://www.acslaw.org/projects/the-presidential-investigation-education-project/other-resources/key-findings-of-the-mueller-report/)(The investigation produced 37 indictments; seven guilty pleas or convictions; and compelling evidence that the president obstructed justice on multiple occasions.) identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice.

1.3.8.3.2.2. Pro: More than [1000 former federal prosecutors](https://medium.com/\@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1)(Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.) agreed that President Trump’s conduct, had he had been a private citizen, would have resulted in multiple felony charges.
1.3.8.3.3. Con: President Trump called the Muller report the “[greatest Political Crime in the History of the U.S., the Russian Witch-Hunt](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/06/why-the-mueller-investigation-failed).”

1.3.8.4.3. Con: Even if President Trump might have been involved in financial crimes, as President of the United States, he had [protection from legal action](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54716550), and therefore the crimes weren't proven.
1.3.8.4.4. Pro: President Trump was in violation of the [Constitution's foreign emoluments clause](https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-the-emoluments-clause)(A provision of the U.S. Constitution \(Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 8\) that generally prohibits federal officeholders from receiving any gift, payment, or other thing of value from a foreign state or its rulers, officers, or representatives.) and earned [countless foreign revenue](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/08/china-approves-trump-trademarks-businesses) for his and his family's businesses.
1.3.8.4.4.1. Con: Generating revenue by your business is not considered a gift, emolument, office, or title from foreign states, therefore it was not in violation of the [Title of Nobility Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_of_Nobility_Clause)(The Titles of Nobility Clause was designed to shield the federal officeholders of the United States against so-called "corrupting foreign influences.).
1.3.8.4.4.1.1. Con: Simply generating revenue is not the issue. It is the [revenue received due in part to being U.S. President which afforded foreign countries a favor.](https://www.salon.com/2018/12/07/veterans-say-the-saudi-regime-duped-them-to-funnel-funds-to-the-presidents-business-empire_partner/)

1.3.8.5. Con: If being implicated in crimes disqualified someone from being president, the American people would be left with very few good candidates.
1.4. Pro: President Trump improved the United States during his presidency.
1.4.1. Pro: President Trump has [helped the U.S. economy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430).

1.4.1.1.1. Con: COVID-19 created a [recession in the global economy](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/06/08/covid-19-to-plunge-global-economy-into-worst-recession-since-world-war-ii), independently of President Trump's weak responses.

1.4.1.2. Pro: President Trump enacted [corporate tax reform](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/).
1.4.1.2.1. Con: President Trump said his tax policies would result in much faster growth, as high as 6%. GDP [grew](https://www.bea.gov/news/glance) 2.4% in 2017, 2.9% in 2018 and through the 3rd quarter of 2019, average growth was just 2.3%.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: President Trump promised to lower the [corporate tax rate](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000), and he brought corporation tax down from 35% to 15%.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: In terms of the [economy and the deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/tax_cuts.asp), this may prove to be a bad move in the long run.
1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: This meant [billions](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2019/09/26/475083/trumps-corporate-tax-cut-not-trickling/) of dollars in lost revenues and was not a fiscally responsible decision.
1.4.1.2.2.3. Con: [Lowering the corporate tax rate](https://www.cbpp.org/under-new-tax-law-high-income-investors-can-use-corporations-to-defer-their-taxes-for-decades-1) substantially below the top personal income tax rate can jeopardize the integrity of the tax system as high-income individuals will attempt to shelter their savings within corporations.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: The corporate tax reform was needed to allow US manufacturers to [compete](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/praise-president-trumps-commitment-tax-reform/) on a global stage, with [tax rates more on par with other nation's tax rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017).
1.4.1.2.4. Con: President Trump's tax reforms helped the [mega-rich](https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2019/10/10/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less-taxes-than-the-working-class-in-2018/?sh=7e4881373128) of America get away with paying less in taxes than the working class.
1.4.1.3. Con: In November 2020, the US economy had the biggest [economic contraction](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430) ever recorded and the highest unemployment rate in more than 80 years.

1.4.1.3.2. Pro: The [US unemployment rate](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/us-economy-doing-amazingly-well-trump/articleshow/76490224.cms?from=mdr) for April 2020 was 14.7%, which was the highest since 1948.
1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: An estimated 300,000 US jobs were lost because of [President Trump's trade war with China](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-trade-war-squashed-an-estimated-300000-jobs-so-far-moodys-estimates/).

Conflating unemployment because of the pandemic with unemployment as a product of President Trump's economy is a fallacy. [Since April 2020, it has dropped to 7.9%](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm).
1.4.1.3.3. Con: The "economic contraction" was a product of the COVID-19 pandemic, not a product of Trump's economic policies. Before the pandemic hit, the [US unemployment rate was 3.5%](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm), the lowest in the last two decades.
1.4.1.3.3.1. Con: The economy cannot prosper if the President fails to address threats to national security. Policies that outwardly are not economic in nature are linked to the economy.
1.4.1.4. Con: President Trump didn't help the US economy. He [inherited a strong economy from Obama's administration](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2c298bda-8aee-4923-84a3-95a54f7f6e6f/did-trump-create-or-inherit-the-strong-economy.pdf).
1.4.1.5. Pro: President Trump's stewardship and policies led to historic economic achievements across a number of different metrics.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: President Trump's stewardship or service to anything that didn't directly or indirectly [benefit himself, or his legacy](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2017/04/27/431387/trump-100-days-case-studies-trumps-self-serving-special-interest-government/), was non-existent.
1.4.1.5.2. Con: The economy was strong [as a result of President Obama's economic decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/us/politics/trump-obama-economy.html). Most of President Trump's decisions only had a [negligible or net negative effect](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/trumps-economic-policies-failed-to-deliver-promised-3percent-growth-in-2018.html) on the economy.
1.4.1.5.2.1. Con: Under Trump's administration, [the median household income grew from $62,898 in 2016 to $68,703 in 2019](https://theprint.in/opinion/donald-trumps-economy-really-was-better-than-obamas/534326/).
1.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: [Analysts](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-presidents-economic-decisions-matter-eventually/) and [economists](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/donald-trump-economy-stock-market-jobs-reports-credit/) argue that it takes two or more years for presidential decisions to have a noticeable effect on the economy, outside of crisis situations.
1.4.1.5.2.2.1. Con: White House economist Kevin Hassett stated that President Trump deserved all the credit for the U.S. [economic 'inflection](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/12/646708799/fact-check-who-gets-credit-for-the-booming-u-s-economy)'.
1.4.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: This implies that the results can be attributed to Obama, not to President Trump.
1.4.1.5.3. Pro: He pushed through a [revolutionary tax reform](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html).
1.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: President Trump's tax reforms [stretched](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/) tax brackets and reduced taxes on the middle class.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \(TCJA\) reduced "[statutory tax rates at almost all levels of taxable income](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-did-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-change-personal-taxes)," together with a shift in the thresholds for several income tax brackets.
1.4.1.5.3.1.2. Con: Individual and family taxes will expire in 2025, while the law created a permanent [single corporate tax rate of 21%](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/).
1.4.1.5.3.2. Pro: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was considered the [largest overhaul of the tax code in three decades](https://taxfoundation.org/tax-reform-explained-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/).
1.4.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.3.1.1.
1.4.1.5.3.3. Con: The Tax Reform was of undetermined value - although 37/38 economists thought it was terrible, and the 38th [misread the question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/22/37-of-38-economists-said-the-gop-tax-plans-would-grow-the-debt-the-38th-misread-the-question/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e00556927769).
1.4.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: It was vital to canvass opinions from [experts in the field](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reform-2), given that President Trump was not an economist and [every new measure](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/12/02/the-senate-passes-a-tax-bill?zid=297&ah=3ae0fe266c7447d8a0c7ade5547d62ca) seemed likely to worsen America's financial situation.
1.4.1.5.3.3.2. Con: The [economy was booming](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trade-war-tariffs-us-economy-jobs-report-federal-reserve-g7-finance-ministers-wilbur-ross-china-a8380631.html) after the tax cut legislation, suggesting that these economists have zero predictive power.
1.4.1.5.3.4. Con: The tax cut boosted the [Federal deficit to trillion-dollars](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/08/20/donald-trump-trillion-dollar-plus-deficits-fiscal-ruin-column/986236002/), on top of the already high deficits imposed by the previous administration to counter the 2008 financial crash and recession.
1.4.1.5.3.5. Pro: There are additional benefits to people that may flow from longer-term macroeconomic factors, commonly known as '[trickle-down](https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572)(Trickle-down economics is a theory that claims benefits for the wealthy trickle down to everyone else. These benefits are tax cuts on businesses, high-income earners, capital gains, and dividends.)' economics.
1.4.1.5.3.5.1. Con: The long-term effects of the tax cut were already [costing the US $2.3 trillion](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/tax-cuts-trump-gop-analysis-430781) in 2018.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2. Con: Ample [research](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85) and [examples](https://www.thebalance.com/trickle-down-economics-theory-effect-does-it-work-3305572) have [shown](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/letters/ct-trickle-down-economics-doesn-t-work-20171124-story.html) that trickle down economics do not often [work](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/the-best-way-to-spur-growth-help-the-poor-not-the-rich) as intended.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1. Con: The [economy was booming](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trade-war-tariffs-us-economy-jobs-report-federal-reserve-g7-finance-ministers-wilbur-ross-china-a8380631.html) in 2018, suggesting all of those sources are irrelevant.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: The U.S. economy grew [2.9% In 2018](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/28/698884578/u-s-economy-grew-2-9-percent-in-2018-just-below-trumps-target).
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: The [equity market performance](http://www.uobgroup.com.sg/web-resources/uobgroup/pdf/research/MN_201028B.pdf?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D58807668847636526022661862915996130797%7CMCORGID%3D116168F454E6DA2A0A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1604361601) was considerably better during President Trump's first three years, compared to the same period for President Obama. \(p.5\)
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.3. Con: Particular parts of the economy were "booming". But [growing household debt](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-debt-charts-graphic-idUSKBN1XN2OH), and [growing income inequality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/26/income-inequality-america-highest-its-been-since-census-started-tracking-it-data-show/), combined with growing [cost of living](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm) is NOT a good kind of "boom".
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.4. Con: This is a [post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc) fallacy. Simply because there have been positive economic occurrences during the Trump presidency does not mean that he caused them.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.4.1. Pro: Many of the [metrics](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/25420/economics/us-economy-under-obama-2009-2017/) are the same as 2019 being the biggest year on record. All economic metrics continued the same trend that were in place from his predecessor. Except the Dow, which was negative in 2018 after huge growth.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.4.2. Pro: [Evidence shows](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/24/17759940/donald-trump-economy-jobs-growth-obama) these economic occurrences to be a continuation of [long-term trends](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jul/27/fact-checking-donald-trumps-points-about-economy/) that pre-date him.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.4.3. Pro: Under Hitler, Nazi Germany experienced a massive revival and uplift in its [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Recovery_and_rearmament). This did not make him a good leader. By the same metric, these didn't make Trump a good President.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.4.3.1. Con: Hitler's economic advancements were not what made him a bad leader, but the [genocide of millions of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) and the stain he created on Germany. As horrible as Hitler was, it is possible for him to have done deeds that in themselves were good. A definition of [good](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/good) can be `benefit or advantage to someone or something.` Therefore, we should compare the actions that were advantageous against actions that were disadvantageous.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.5. Con: The 2018 upward trend in the economy and employment was already a [reality before President Trump took office](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/12/646708799/fact-check-who-gets-credit-for-the-booming-u-s-economy).
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.5.1. Pro: This was in spite of President Trump, [not because of him](http://theweek.com/articles/786614/americas-economy-booming-trump-nothing). It was growing along the [same basic trajectory](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/01/26/that-trump-economic-boom-its-mostly-hype/) as before he took office.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.5.2. Con: Median [family income](https://www.bloombergquint.com/gadfly/trump-s-economy-really-was-better-than-obama-s) soared under President Trump's administration.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.5.3. Con: The average hourly earnings rose at [3% per month, on average, compared to 2.3%](http://www.uobgroup.com.sg/web-resources/uobgroup/pdf/research/MN_201028B.pdf?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D58807668847636526022661862915996130797%7CMCORGID%3D116168F454E6DA2A0A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1604361601) under Obama's administration. \(p. 3\)
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.2.2.
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.2. Pro: The theory of trickle-down economics [doesn't work](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85), as cutting the top tax rate does [not lead to economic growth](http://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons).
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.3. Pro: Supply-side economics result in greater [income inequality](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/42729).
1.4.1.5.3.5.2.4. Pro: The rise of national and local [costs of living](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-does-current-cost-living-compare-20-years-ago.asp) as well as natural currency [inflation](http://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons) increases at a faster and steeper [rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/244983/projected-inflation-rate-in-the-united-states/) than the rate at which funds can [trickle](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/the-best-way-to-spur-growth-help-the-poor-not-the-rich) from higher socio-economic levels to lower ones.
1.4.1.5.3.5.3. Pro: According to the [trickle-down theory](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/174/economics/trickle-down-economics/), if the richest increase their wealth, they will spend a proportion of this extra wealth, which will cause more demand for goods and services and higher employment.
1.4.1.5.3.6. Con: The tax cuts [primarily benefit](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tax-plan-consequences/) the owners of capital via the businesses they own. In total dollar terms, only a marginal portion of the tax cuts benefited the so-called ‘hard-working Americans’.
1.4.1.5.3.7. Pro: The executive branch with President Trump at the helm was [slashing bloated regulations](https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/two-months-to-go-regulatory-budget-progress/). At the last count for the financial year of 2018, 47 regulations were cut & 10 new regulations were created, resulting in YTD savings of $621.5M in taxpayer money.
1.4.1.5.3.7.1. Con: It is still very unclear if this was a good thing or not. The overall savings weren't very high at $8 billion, while the cost was harder to quantify as some of the deregulatory actions and the blocking of new regulations may have put lives in jeopardy as a [result.](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/01/20/trumps-regulatory-experiment-year-one-000620)
1.4.1.5.4. Con: Overall, [President Trump's economic policies increased economic inequality](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55941).
1.4.1.5.5. Pro: The American economy was experiencing [4.2%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gdp-growth-revised-up-in-second-quarter-1535546347) GDP growth in 2018, which contrasted positively against the recession [predicted](http://robertreich.org/post/136616314155) by some economists.
1.4.1.5.5.1. Con: The economy has been [booming](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) since 2010, while the tax plan was passed at the end of [2017](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188165/annual-gdp-growth-of-the-united-states-since-1990/). The inflation, however, [accelerated](https://www.thebalance.com/unemployment-rate-by-year-3305506) since Trump became President.
1.4.1.5.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.3.3.2.
1.4.1.5.6. Pro: U.S. small business optimism hit its [highest level in history](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-11/u-s-small-business-optimism-at-record-high-on-hiring-spending) under Trump's presidency.
1.4.1.5.6.1. Con: That is not proof of any policy success. The index is provided by the [NFIB](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business), which surveys only a small fraction of its members, which represent only about 10% \(300k of 30 million\) of small businesses in the nation, and is backed by and lobbies for large corporate interests.
1.4.1.5.6.2. Pro: Consumer confidence surged to an [18 year high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/29/us-economy-second-quarter-revised-report-figures) in 2018.
1.4.1.5.6.2.1. Con: The article cited is two years old. Because of President Trump's failure, [millions of Americans](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-us-jobless-claims-flat-at-884000-a-fresh-wave-of-layoffs-hitting-the-economy-2020-09-10?mod=article_inline) are still out of work, and others [anticipate losing their homes](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk/). In light of this, consumer confidence considerably reduced, and is [likely to stay that way](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/there-will-be-no-v-shaped-recovery-for-consumer-sentiment-datatrek-says-2020-08-18) for a while.
1.4.1.5.6.3. Pro: America’s biggest companies [reported](https://fortune.com/2019/11/05/corporate-earnings-markets-up-recession/) some of the strongest earnings growth since the recession under Trump's presidency.
1.4.1.5.7. Pro: The USA experienced historically low unemployment under President Trump.
1.4.1.5.7.1. Con: The trend was [present in the previous administration as well.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/07/04/trumps-unemployment-rates-are-still-worse-than-obamas-highest-numbers/) There is no reason to believe that President Trump's policies had anything to do with it.
1.4.1.5.7.1.1. Con: President Trump created 6.6 million jobs in his first three years, which was a [4.4% increase](https://www.thebalance.com/job-creation-by-president-by-number-and-percent-3863218) compared to the end of Obama's term.
1.4.1.5.7.1.2. Pro: [This chart](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) shows what the unemployment numbers actually are. They have fallen about one percentage point each year since 2011, this trend was continuing until COVID-19.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3. Pro: Economic indicators do not necessarily prove when a President is doing well. The suggestion that a President can directly control and manipulate the American economy and is entirely responsible for its success or failure is absurd.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.1. Pro: President Obama entered office during the [economic crisis](https://www.brookings.edu/research/president-barack-obamas-first-two-years-policy-accomplishments-political-difficulties/) and throughout the majority of his first year was dealing with large unemployment. This didn't mean that he was an unsuccessful President.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.2. Con: Certain indicators like the incentive to be reelected result in an [increase in presidential effort on GDP growth](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264087748_Can_the_president_really_affect_economic_growth_Presidential_effort_and_the_political_business_cycle).
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.2.1. Con: Economic arguments for the success of a president are based as much on [partisanship as they are on data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/11/07/trump-is-right-about-one-thing-the-economy-does-better-under-the-democrats/#51245ee86786).
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.3. Pro: The President's claim of job creation as evidence of his success was overstated. Job growth continued on the trend in [Obama's second term](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/20/trump-v-obama-economy-charts/), albeit at a slower pace.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.3.1. Pro: According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth), job growth in 2017 was lower than past four years.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: 2018's growth of 208k jobs \(through Sept\), was lower than 2015 and 2016. If the President's claim was that his tax cuts created jobs, it was not evident in job numbers.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.3.2. Con: Job creation under President Trump's administration [started stronger than President Obama's](https://fortune.com/longform/comparing-trump-on-jobs-us-economy-past-presidents-obama-bush-clinton/), until it was hit by COVID-19.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.3.3. Pro: Unemployment rates were at [record lows](http://www.oecd.org/economy/labour/47656668.pdf) in many other countries as a result of a long global expansion that followed the financial crisis in 2008.
1.4.1.5.7.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Many of these countries had policies directly contrary to the President's. Thirty-six countries had rates lower than the USA, including Japan \(2.4%\), Germany \(3.4%\), Mexico \(3.4%\), Poland \(3.5%\), and Hungary \(3.6%\).
1.4.1.5.7.2. Pro: Black and [Hispanic](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/craig-bannister/hispanic-latino-unemployment-rate-hits-lowest-level-record-june) unemployment rates were [historically low](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/black-unemployment-falls-to-second-lowest-on-record-2018-09-07) in 2018 and 2019.
1.4.1.5.7.2.1. Con: This is more a result of [Obama's policies than Trump's](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/trump-takes-undue-credit-black-unemployment/).
1.4.1.5.7.2.2. Pro: In September 2019, Black unemployment hit the [record rate of 5.5%](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/04/black-and-hispanic-unemployment-is-at-a-record-low.html).
1.4.1.5.7.3. Pro: Female unemployment was at the [lowest rate for 65 years](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-female-employment-sorry-women-i-let-you-down-again-1098500) in 2018.
1.4.1.5.7.3.1. Pro: The unemployment rate for women fell to [3.6%](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20181005).
1.4.1.5.7.3.2. Con: Even if 863,000 women joined the workforce during the first 11 months of Trump's presidency, that number still represented [34% less](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/misleading-talking-point-women-workers/) when compared to the same period, from January to December, in each of the last two years.
1.4.1.5.7.4. Con: Even assuming that [lower unemployment was a result of President Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-trump-gop-economy-job-growth-report-2018-9) actions during his time in office, [wealth inequality](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/151188/growing-inequality-trump-era) was [increasing](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-economic-agenda-is-exacerbating-americas-inequality-crisis-2018-8), and [wages](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/11/12/what-a-trump-administration-might-mean-for-income-inequality/#18f88433a783) when adjusted for inflation were stagnant.
1.4.1.5.7.4.1. Pro: It is also important to take into account whether the new jobs created provided [liveable wages](https://undocs.org/A/HRC/38/33/ADD.1). A stronger economy ought to mean real benefits for average families, not just those at the top.
1.4.1.5.7.5. Pro: In 2018, the unemployment rate was at its [lowest in 50 years](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654417887/u-s-unemployment-rate-drops-to-3-7-percent-lowest-in-nearly-50-years), when it dropped to 3.7%.
1.4.1.5.7.5.1. Con: The trend towards low [unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) has been following a relatively unchanged curve for 10 years \(far longer than Trump's presidency\), and if anything, that curve only shallowed since President Trump took office.
1.4.1.5.7.5.2. Pro: After the 2020 increase due to COVID-19, the [rate of unemployment dropped from 14.7% \(April\) to 13.3%](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/05/politics/trump-unemployment-numbers-protests/index.html) \(June 2020\).
1.4.1.5.8. Con: [President Trump's trade policies further undermined the confidence](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollars-status-worlds-funding-currency-question-144437776.html) and trust global markets had for decades in utilizing the U.S. dollar as a standard currency.
1.4.1.5.8.1. Pro: President Trump had a [17th-century](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-trade-policy-is-stuck-in-the-80s--the-1680s/2018/05/31/f8e2f7c2-6510-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?utm_term=.fbfab00f21c7) [zero-sum view](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-zero-sum-worlds-of-trump-and-sanders-1458504854) of international trade which was [refuted](http://theconversation.com/trumps-exports-good-imports-bad-trade-policy-debunked-by-an-economist-94625) by [economists](https://qz.com/894085/donald-trumps-mercantilist-trade-policy-was-debunked-by-economist-adam-smith-more-than-200-years-ago/) of all stripes.
1.4.1.5.8.1.1. Pro: He supports anti-trade policies such as [tariffs](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trump-trade-war/) and has opposed free trade deals such as the [TPP](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjqiuOKwMPpAhUWa80KHfVcD3MQFjAAegQICBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fstory%2F2019%2F01%2F23%2Ftrans-pacific-trade-pact-2017-1116638&usg=AOvVaw20md5kqynYQV0bQ6N_08pF) and NAFTA while failing to recognize the zero-sum nature of them.
1.4.2. Con: President Trump undermined [democracy](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-weak-undermine-democracy/) within the United States.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The attack on the [Capitol on the 6th of January 2021](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55572825), promoted in part by President Trump and undertaken by his supporters, represented a direct attack on US democracy.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: President Trump encouraged his [supporters to fight](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-protests-idUSKBN29B24S) after the 2020 election's results.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: President Trump incited violence at a rally before the 6th of January 2020 by saying "[if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55640437)."
1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: President Trump [denied any responsibility](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210112-trump-takes-no-responsibility-for-capitol-attack-says-his-speech-was-totally-appropriate) for the Capitol attack.
1.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Trump can deny responsibility; but that doesn't absolve him of it or magically make it go away. Many of those arrested or were there have stated that they were there [because of Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55640437).
1.4.2.1.2. Con: President Trump [condemned](https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump-condemns-us-capitol-violence-doesnt-mention-impeachment/a-56218910) the violence at the Capitol, and should not be held liable for the actions of his supporters.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: President Trump made many [provocations that incited his supporters to act violently at the Capitol.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55640437)
1.4.2.1.2.2. Con: President Trump's supporters, who attacked the Capitol, acknowledged that they did so [because of what President Trump told them about the election](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/nyregion/protesters-blaming-trump-pardon.html).
1.4.2.1.3. Con: President Trump’s [words](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-peacefully-and-patriotically/)(After this, we’re going to walk down — and I’ll be there with you — we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down — anyone you want, but I think right here — we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength, and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing, and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated — lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today.) “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today" were never reported by the liberal media, and his words “fight like hell” were taken out of context.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: President Trump, or one of his associates, appears to have [destroyed phone records](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/02/what-is-trump-hiding-capitol-riot-call-log-phone-records)(Yet when you look for recorded details of Trump’s 2.26pm call which was made, as Hugo Lowell of the Guardian revealed, on an official White House landline, they are nowhere to be found. The Lee call was one of an unknown number that Trump made during a mysterious gap of 7 hours 37 minutes that exists in the call logs – precisely the timeframe of the Capitol attack.\n\nThose missing call logs, disclosed by the Washington Post and CBS News, raise several burning questions – how did the records disappear? who carried out the excising? – but none more urgent than this: what was Trump trying to hide?\n\n“A gap like this doesn’t happen by accident. It’s not a coincidence,” said Charlie Sykes, columnist at the Trump-resistant conservative outlet the Bulwark. “There is no innocent explanation here – somebody made the decision to rip up the record for the crucial hours of January 6 and there has to be a reason why.”) related to the attack on the Capitol, strongly implying he has something to hide.
1.4.2.2. Pro: President Trump violated several [democratic norms](https://theconversation.com/why-trumps-challenges-to-democracy-will-be-a-big-problem-for-biden-152218) during his presidency.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.3.2.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: President Trump did not respect the [legitimacy of the 2020 elections](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/we-won-trump-spreads-misinformation-about-2020-election-during-final-n1252802).
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Many candidates who lose the presidential elections do not respect the legitimacy of the elections they lost.
1.4.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Hillary Clinton blamed her loss in the 2016 elections on supposed [Russian interference](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/02/526586505/clinton-blames-2016-loss-on-comey-letter-russian-interference-and-herself).
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: President Trump used the [legal system to attack political opponents](https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/democrats/2019/12/10/trump-and-the-threat-to-democracy/), and he expressed admiration for foreign autocrats.
1.4.2.3. Con: American democracy was already undermined before President Trump: it was [polarized and based on race and economic inequality](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/trump-presidency-and-american-democracy-a-historical-and-comparative-analysis/E157E9BBA8D3E531A7DD4FD1A01E0478) which ultimately caused the erosion of democratic norms.
1.4.3. Con: President Trump sowed greater [division among Americans](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/americas-great-divide-from-obama-to-trump/transcript/).
1.4.3.1. Pro: President Trump used [identity politics](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/12/2/13718770/identity-politics) to further divide American communities.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The liberal mainstream media uses [gender identity politics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/28/trump-says-he-rejects-feminism-because-he-is-for-everyone/?utm_term=.8e1b46b7ea6b) to divide our communities. President Trump rejected gender identity politics.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: The media may report on gender identity politics but President Trump used it on purpose.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: President Trump used identity politics when he pledged to [nominate a woman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/21/trump-has-never-shied-away-identity-politics-despite-his-allies-loathing-it/)(“It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman,” he said at a Saturday rally in Fayetteville, N.C. “I haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list.”) to the Supreme Court to fill the seat of judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con: President Trump criticized identity politics for influencing US history studies and for "[fostering resentment by trying to divide people](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-commission-says-identity-politics-and-bitterness-have-warped-history-classes/2021/01)".
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Biased journalism](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-media-war-how-biased-journalism-is-dividing-america/) plays an important role on identity politics and the division in the US.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: [Hillary Clinton's campaign was largely identity politics to divide the electorate,](https://www.city-journal.org/html/hillarys-web-promises-14624.html) President Trump smashed this and what we saw were remains.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: President Trump divided his supporters and peaceful protesters by calling the protesters [bad people](https://www.voanews.com/usa/trump-calls-floyd-death-shocking-calls-protesters-thugs) and suggesting that they were not like his fans.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: President Trump implemented laws in order to ease and allow discrimination [against the LGBTQ+ community](https://www.hrc.org/news/trump-pence-admin-moves-to-undermine-lgbtq-protections-in-health-care).
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: By playing identity politics and picking a definitive side on hundreds of controversial topics, President Trump created many small groups of ["us" vs "them"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/opinion/trump-2020-us-them.html).
1.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: President Trump [constantly repeated buzzwords and phrases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/opinion/letters/identity-politics-david-brooks.html) that were widely used by various hate groups to inspire enmity against a wide array of minority groups.
1.4.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: He [defiles the identity of others](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/apr/17/presidents-nicknames-slimeball-comey-former-fbi-director) and slanders [entire religions](https://medium.com/nilc/86-times-donald-trump-displayed-or-promoted-islamophobia-49e67584ac10) as [s***holes](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-africa-travel-ban-immigration-shithole-countries-remark.html) populated by [drug-dealers, criminals and rapists](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916/drug-dealers-criminals-rapists-what-trump-thinks-of-mexicans).
1.4.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: This [ancient practice](https://phys.org/news/2018-08-ancient-rome-insults-politics-knew.html), including [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)(Short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments, most of which are fallacious.) attacks, appeals to the worst and most base feelings within the stressed and distressed, building a wide base of blind, nonthinking and unwavering supporters.
1.4.3.1.4.2. Con: President Trump set a common enemy for his people to motivate them and unite the country.
1.4.3.1.4.2.1. Con: It is a common tool and theme of fascism, exactly what the [Nazi party did](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/why-did-hitler-hate-jews/) with the Jews and other European powers in the wake of World War I and run-up to World War II.
1.4.3.2. Pro: President Trump intensified [racial inequality](https://www.pewresearch.org/2021/01/29/how-america-changed-during-donald-trumps-presidency/) in the US.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: In 2019, [56% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/2021/01/29/how-america-changed-during-donald-trumps-presidency/) said that President Trump had worsened race relations in the US.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: According to the majority of Americans, President Trump Increased US [racial tensions after George Floyd's death](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/06/871404645/majority-of-americans-say-trump-increased-racial-tensions-after-george-floyds-de).
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: President Trump was supported by several [minority groups](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389) in the 2020 election.

1.4.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: According to the AP Votecast, only [8% of black voters voted for President Trump](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21537966/trump-black-voters-exit-polls).
1.4.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: President Trump failed to implement a $500 billion investment [\(Platinum Plan\)](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21537966/trump-black-voters-exit-polls) in the black community as he promised.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Many of the perceived benefits the black community thought happened because of President Trump, were not the result of his policies, but the continuation of increasing prosperity driven largely by rising [minimum wages at the state and local levels](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/whose-wages-are-rising-and-why/), as well as a more [competitive labor market](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/business/economy/wage-growth-economy.html).
1.4.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: President [Trump's Latino support](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-54861000) grew in the 2020 election.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: [Racial inequalities](https://theconversation.com/the-fury-in-us-cities-is-rooted-in-a-long-history-of-racist-policing-violence-and-inequality-139752) are rooted in US history.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: African Americans have protested against racist policing and legal and extra-legal discrimination since the [post-Civil War days in the 1870s](https://theconversation.com/the-fury-in-us-cities-is-rooted-in-a-long-history-of-racist-policing-violence-and-inequality-139752).
1.4.4. Con: President Trump harmed [international views of America](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/opinion/trump-foreign-policy-us-allies.html).
1.4.4.1. Con: Confidence in President Trump was low internationally, but the [views of the U.S. were still relatively favorable](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/01/08/trump-ratings-remain-low-around-globe-while-views-of-u-s-stay-mostly-favorable/).
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Confidence in President Trump increased in many nations around the world, especially on [the ideological right](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/01/08/trump-ratings-remain-low-around-globe-while-views-of-u-s-stay-mostly-favorable/).
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: International views of the U.S. in 2019 were [over 50% favorable](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51012853).
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Favourability of the US rose from [34% to 62%](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/06/10/americas-image-abroad-rebounds-with-transition-from-trump-to-biden/) after President Trump left office.
1.4.4.2. Pro: President Trump damaged the international opinion of the United States, diminishing its standing and prestige in the eyes of the world.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: President Trump's behaviour and character were very [polarising](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/), and he often contradicted himself, or outright lied.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: It was only polarising because so many people were very biased. That was not President Trump's fault.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: That argument would take the whole responsibility from President Trump to load it just on the citizens.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: "People are biased" is a knockout-argument, you could add it everywhere where people are criticised for their behaviour.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The fault is probably primarily that of the media, which has discovered that [fomenting partisan conflict and outrage](https://medium.com/millennial-voices/how-the-media-may-be-contributing-to-political-polarization-4e827fc3c9c9) increases revenue.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2. Con: It was President Trump's fault. [Posting](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html) 500 insults publicly on Twitter, several hundred within his first 3 months in office, was very polarizing.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: President Trump always seemed to pivot on his views.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: During the campaign, he described Ben Carson as a [very, very special person, although he had previously compared the other candidate to a child molester](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/magazine/look-out-for-the-trump-pivot.html).
1.4.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: This may have been because President Trump was [initially running for office against Ben Carson](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-carson-idUSKBN13U1CF), and then, having won, he actively reached out to mend bridges and form an alliance with his former opponent.
1.4.4.2.1.3. Pro: President Trump lacked credibility on the world stage due in part to his frequent and transparent use of [weak, unsound, and fallacious arguments.](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2017-08-17/how-donald-trump-fails-logic-and-presidential-thinking)
1.4.4.2.2. Con: President Trump created a positive image of America in some areas that have traditionally shown derision and hatred towards the US, like [North Korea](https://www.ft.com/content/82df7074-7522-11e8-aa31-31da4279a601).
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: While there were multiple summits, nothing ultimately came of them, and there is no evidence that [any lasting positive image or relationship was created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_relations#Trump_administration_\(2017%E2%80%932021\)).
1.4.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.3.
1.4.4.2.4. Pro: President Trump was extremely uneducated, to the point that it was embarrassing.
1.4.4.2.4.1. Pro: President Trump made silly mistakes when talking about history.
1.4.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: At a Black History Month event, President Trump commented, “[Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/04/donald-trump-says-hes-a-fan-of-history-but-he-doesnt-seem-to-trust-historians/).” Douglass died in 1895.
1.4.4.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Dead people can gain more recognition for their past acts. By definition, recognition of someone's actions merely needs to happen anytime after those actions have been committed. As another example, many artists are not recognized at all until after their death.
1.4.4.2.4.1.2. Pro: President Trump suggested that the Civil War might have been prevented if [Andrew Jackson had been involved](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/trump-andrew-jackson-fact-check.html). Jackson couldn't have prevented the Civil War, because he [died 16 years before the war started](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/01/526388034/fact-check-could-andrew-jackson-have-stopped-the-civil-war-as-trump-said).
1.4.4.2.4.1.2.1. Con: President Trump's actual quote in the New York Times, "[I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn’t have had the Civil War](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/trump-andrew-jackson-fact-check.html)", does not indicate that he thought Andrew Jackson was alive during the Civil War.
1.4.4.2.4.2. Pro: President Trump [suggested injecting disinfectants](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177) to treat COVID-19.
1.4.4.2.4.2.1. Con: [Bronchoalveolar lavage \(BAL\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage) \(also known as lung washing\) is a diagnostic method of the lower respiratory system in which a [bronchoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscope) is passed through the mouth or nose into the [lungs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung). It has even been used therapeutically to remove mucus, improve airway ventilation, and reduce airway inflammation in conditions such as COPD and PAP. Therefore, suggesting that doctors try injecting fluids into the lungs for cleaning wasn't a completely ridiculous idea.
1.4.4.2.4.2.2. Pro: After President Trump's suggestion in April 2020, the state of [Maryland's emergency hotline](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52450692) had received hundreds of calls from people seeking guidance about Trump's comments.
1.4.4.2.4.3. Con: President Trump graduated with a [degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump).
1.4.4.2.4.4. Con: A President's level of education is not necessarily indicative of their performance in their role of President. What makes a good President is their ability to successfully uphold the ideals established by the people and implemented through Congress.
1.4.4.2.4.4.1. Con: Having a certain level of education helps Presidents build better policies.
1.4.4.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: If a President has a strong understanding of history via their education, they will be able to construct better policies [built on the knowledge the past has to offer](https://work.chron.com/education-need-want-president-30956.html).
1.4.4.2.4.5. Pro: By repeatedly making inaccurate claims, President Trump has made America a joke across the globe.
1.4.4.2.4.5.1. Con: It is better to have a President that either makes surface-level mistakes or tells extremely trivial lies than a President who intentionally tells meaningful lies to the American people.
1.4.4.2.4.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.3.
1.4.4.2.4.5.2. Pro: The U.S. is l[ess respected and less influential than it has been in decades](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-foreign-policy-destroyed-international-standing-1084802/).
1.4.4.2.5. Con: President Trump's ferocious fighting style was good for the public image of the United States.
1.4.4.2.5.1. Pro: President Trump showed touch aggressive attitudes towards the world's injustice and other countries' pressures.
1.4.4.2.5.1.1. Pro: Without the [help of President Trump](https://qz.com/1909749/how-trumps-presidency-has-helped-the-eu/), the EU could not have faced the on-going imperialism of the Chinese communist government.
1.4.4.2.5.1.1.1. Con: The notion that China is acting in an imperialist fashion is heavily [contested](http://www.cseba.eu/news/china-is-not-imperialist-power/464/).
1.4.4.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.4.
1.4.4.2.7. Pro: President Trump was [disrespectful](https://www.insider.com/trump-meeting-queen-breaking-royal-protocol-2019-6)(Officials and dignitaries are briefed on royal protocol before interacting with a member of the royal family. They're instructed on how to greet them, the appropriate distance they should keep, and how to conduct themselves at meals.\n\nBut missteps inevitably happen, and President Donald Trump appears to have broken royal protocol on several occasions over his visits to the UK.) towards [foreign](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/us/trump-walks-front-queen-elizabeth.html) [leaders](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-video-trump-shocks-britain-by-cutting-off-queen-elizabeth-1.6270919) and [heads of state](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/14/17571986/trump-walks-in-front-of-queen).
1.4.4.2.7.1. Pro: His hate-speech rhetoric widens the diplomatic gap between the US and most European countries and has been shown to [bring discrimination and human rights violations to new heights](https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/).
1.4.4.2.8. Pro: President Trump consistently created a bad image of America and its citizens by tweeting unpresidential statements.
1.4.4.2.8.1. Con: The 'storm' was created by the media frenzy, not the tweet itself. The [bias of the media](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/22/jimmy-carter-media-has-been-harder-trump-than-predecessors/788558001/) necessitated direct communication with the electorate and the world.
1.4.4.2.8.1.1. Con: Many of his [tweets](https://www.complex.com/life/worst-donald-trump-tweets/no-love-for-trump) were offensive, grammatically questionable and/or plain bizarre.
1.4.4.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: The media and President Trump himself are both responsible for the "Trump cloud". Trump is less presidential in behavior than preceding presidents, but on the other hand, the media is more fired up and prone to exaggeration than ever. This is a more plausible explanation than only making just one of these two responsible.
1.4.4.2.8.1.2. Pro: The press is controlled by a [few people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership) that can dictate what gets published.
1.4.4.2.8.1.2.1. Con: The United States has many large national [independent newspapers](http://independent newspapers) and the White House press corps [represents many more national and international news sources.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_press_corps#Correspondents)
1.4.4.2.8.1.2.2. Con: By far, the most damning international reportage of President Trump's lies and failings was [his](https://twitter.com/DonTrumpsTrump) [own](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/) [Twitter feed](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump).
1.4.4.2.8.1.3. Pro: President Trump illuminated the bias of media, so Americans could make more informed decisions about the information they were using.
1.4.4.2.8.1.4. Con: A [tweetstorm](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/tweeting-up-a-tweetstorm) is a series of related tweets posted by a Twitter user in quick succession. Nobody in the press or elsewhere made President Trump do that.
1.4.4.2.8.1.4.1. Pro: The 'storm' is [created](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html) by the sheer number of people and organizations he has personally attacked and alienated.
1.4.4.2.8.1.4.2. Pro: [President Trump often tweeted what he saw on Fox News](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/22/a-peek-inside-trumps-twitter-bubble-in-the-wake-of-the-worst-day-of-his-presidency/) or his Twitter feed. That was what created the storm as one would really hope that the President would have had better sources of information.
1.4.4.2.8.2. Con: Twitter is not a reflection of the US or the rest of the world.
1.4.4.2.8.2.1. Con: Any form of communication the president uses is a reflection on the US.
1.4.4.2.8.3. Con: The idea of what is presidential is open to change. A modern transparent president who speaks directly to the people might be preferable to a distanced unrelatable to person who speaks only with elitist language.
1.4.4.2.8.4. Pro: President Trump was unable to accept criticism, took no responsibility for his words and actions, and his behavior and character were [not presidential](https://secondnexus.com/news/donald-trump-fighting-back-enemy-people/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_e65a9090ddee11e8871cc5c94d0ec567).
1.4.4.2.9. Pro: President Trump's antics and behaviour were unbecoming of a president, and as a result, global respect and admiration for US leadership had [never been lower.](https://www.newsweek.com/global-respect-us-leadership-dropped-sharply-under-trump-opposite-happened-784298)
1.4.4.2.10. Con: This statement assumes that standing and prestige in the eyes of the world is more important than efficient management of governmental agencies and services \(including immigration\) in the USA.
1.4.4.2.10.1. Con: President Trump didn't bring "efficient management of governmental agencies and services."
1.4.4.2.10.1.1. Pro: President Trump [weakened many government agencies](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/07/trump-dismantled-the-very-jobs-meant-to-stop-the-covid-19-epidemic-173347), like the CIA, FBI, EPA, and USPS, through sowing distrust, reducing funding, and/or not filling important positions when he first became president.
1.4.4.2.10.2. Con: "Standing and prestige" are [related](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263326310_Prestige_in_world_politics_History_theory_expression) to foreign policy and negotiations with other countries. A decrease in standing/prestige indicates poor foreign policy and hinders negotiations.
1.4.4.2.11. Pro: President Trump seemed unwilling to stand up to, or take a stand against, [foreign governments](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-journalist-khashoggi.html), even when they [murdered](https://globalnews.ca/news/4576018/donald-trump-believes-saudi-explanation-jamal-khashoggi-death/) [American residents](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-corker-says-white-house-has-clamped-down-on-intelligence-about-khashoggi/), such as in the case of [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-corker-says-white-house-has-clamped-down-on-intelligence-about-khashoggi/).
1.4.4.2.12. Con: The large number of migrants that were making their way to US borders to gain US residency suggested people from other countries [desired](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/world/americas/migrants-caravan-mexico.html) to live in a country under President Trump.
1.4.4.2.12.1. Con: This is a [post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc)(Post hoc ergo propter hoc \(Latin: 'after this, therefore because of this'\) is an informal fallacy that states: "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened simply to post hoc fallacy.) claim. That Trump is president and that a large number of migrants are trying to gain US residency does not suggest that the former causes the latter.
1.4.4.2.12.2. Pro: There's a large number of migrants fleeing poverty, corruption and warlike/lawless conditions to what has since it's conception been touted as a land of opportunity.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Many international leaders and experts considered President Trump a [threat to democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/nato-summit-donald-trump-says-germany-is-captive-of-russians).
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: World leaders voiced their concerns about President Trump during his tenure.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: [World leaders reacted with shock and distress](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/01/06/disgraceful-world-leaders-shocked-us-capitol-insurrection/6574051002/) to President Trump's followers' attack on the Capitol on the 6th of January 2021.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: After Biden's victory in the 2020 election, [world leaders expressed hope and relief](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-anne-hidalgo-a4f71db8bab46c4dbc00bf02fe5ef3c1).
1.4.4.3.1.3. Con: Some leaders, like [Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-putin-trump-vote/russias-putin-says-he-sympathized-with-trump-before-u-s-election-idUSKCN1UE2HZ?utm_source=applenews)(Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had “sympathized” with Donald Trump before the 2016 presidential election that swept Trump to power because of his desire to restore normal relations with Russia.), sympathized with President Trump.
1.4.4.3.1.4. Con: North Korean leader, [Kim Jong-Un](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/north-korea-usa-2020-kim-jong-un-donald-trump-south-korea-b1501746.html)(North Korea’s leader and South Korean conservatives form an unlikely alliance in hoping for a second term for the US president, reports Donald Kirk in Seoul.), supported President Trump's reelection in 2020.
1.4.4.3.1.5. Pro: [Angela Merkel](https://www.vogue.com/article/angela-merkel-congratulates-joe-biden-ignores-donald-trump) commented negatively on the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: Many international leaders also [supported President Trump](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/10/world-leaders-who-benefit-trumps-presidency/616709/).
1.4.4.3.2.1. Con: Given Trump's position as President of the United States, many leaders could not have afforded to not support him.
1.4.4.3.3. Con: [Europe's far-right parties](https://theconversation.com/europes-far-right-parties-got-a-boost-from-trump-but-will-they-govern-72319) considered President Trump an example to follow.
1.4.4.3.4. Pro: President Trump had [11 of a possible 14](https://rense.com//general37/fascism.htm) on a fascism score chart.
1.4.4.3.4.1. Pro: President Trump engaged in "[performative fascism](https://www.businessinsider.com/is-trump-fascist-jason-stanley-says-it-is-wrong-question-2020-7)(I'm not saying that Trump is a fascist," he said. "Trump is certainly performing fascism — it's performative fascism that we're seeing. It's the tropes of fascism, and I think that's worrisome enough.)" during his administration.
1.4.4.3.4.2. Con: Multiple experts agree that President [Trump did not fit the definition of a fascist](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21521958/what-is-fascism-signs-donald-trump)(Call him a kleptocrat, an oligarch, a xenophobe, a racist, even an authoritarian. But he doesn’t quite fit the definition of a fascist.).
1.4.5. Pro: President Trump worked to strengthen the US military.
1.4.5.1. Con: President Trump [failed to take action](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-russia-bounties-taliban.html) against bounties being placed on American soldiers.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: That report was never proven as fact. The report itself said it was unverified speculation. It has been blown out of proportion by the media. \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_bounty_program#Russia_reactions)\]
1.4.5.1.2. Con: There were too many bounties, and not many of them ended in the soldier dying. If he had tried to save even a few, the media would slander him for favoring some soldiers over others, so instead of wasting resources, he did other things.
1.4.5.2. Con: President Trump's [continued public shaming of the military](https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-insults-american-veterans-families-2019-10) during his administration created an environment where early retirement or moving to the private sector for a much higher salary had never been more attractive.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: [Leaders](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/military-officers-trump/598360/) in the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies [retired in record numbers under President Trump](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/).
1.4.5.2.1.1. Con: Some of the senior officers who openly criticized President Trump [retired before he became the president](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/trump-generals/601348/).
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: President Trump [snubbed](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trumps-rain-check-honoring-americans-killed-wwi-prompts/story?id=59119504) military veterans and a Remembrance Day service at a US cemetery in Europe to honour fallen soldiers and the 100th Anniversary of the end of the First World War, because of rain.
1.4.5.3. Con: Under President Trump, the US military was involved in various human rights violations.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: President Trump received strong criticism for [banning LGBT+ servicepersons](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43525549) from military services.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.6.2.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Military spending [steadily increased](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54060026) since President Trump took office in 2017.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: President Trump started to cut military spending in January 2019, as he initially announced plans for continued growth from $716 billion in the fiscal year 2019 to $733 billion in 2020, but he later asked [the Department of Defense to plan reductions](https://www.brookings.edu/research/quality-over-quantity-u-s-military-strategy-and-spending-in-the-trump-years/) to a $700 billion budget.
1.4.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.2.
1.4.5.4.3. Pro: US military spending has been [increasing since 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/18/us-military-spending-set-increase-fifth-consecutive-year-nearing-levels-during-height-iraq-war/)("The United States is expected to spend more on its military in 2020 than at any point since World War II, except for a handful of years at the height of the Iraq War."), getting close to the levels reached at the height of Iraq war.
1.4.5.5. Pro: The military funding that [Obama](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-obama-shrank-the-military-1438551147)'s administration had stripped, was restored with President Trump's administration. Underfunding the military can put lives in unnecessary danger from outdated equipment and capabilities.
1.4.5.5.1. Pro: International cyberspace warfare operations are a [new threat](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IjAMNZejWDMJ:https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/8/3/45/pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=pk&client=firefox-b-d) vector to the US. Without military funding, American life and security are at risk.
1.4.5.5.2. Con: President Trump didn't restore military funding, as his military budget was quite [similar to Obama's](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/24/15681846/trump-defense-budget-obama-readiness).
1.4.5.6. Pro: He helped establish the [Space Force](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/21/790492010/trump-created-the-space-force-heres-what-it-will-do?t=1603646944074), which serves the critical mission of protecting the US military's assets in space.
1.4.5.6.1. Pro: Astronauts got sent into space for the first time in [9 years](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-astronauts-launch-1.5538216) \(and the [first commercial one](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/spacex-nasa-reset-countdown-second-try-launch-first-crewed-dragon/)\) due to his strong support for space ventures with his creation and promotion of a [space force](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/trump-space-force).
1.4.5.6.2. Con: President Trump created the Space Force despite the fact the [US Defense Secretary](https://apnews.com/article/644d0aa8c26249eeaa11c2958da4b3ab), Jim Mattis, warned against it.
1.4.5.6.2.1. Pro: James Mattis was opposed to the creation of the Space Force because it would divide "[warfighting functions](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/61800/Barrow%2C%20Gregory%20D..pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)("\[at\] a time when we are trying to integrate the \[DoD’s\] joint warfighting functions, I do not wish to add a separate service that would likely present a narrower and even parochial approach to space operations.")".
1.4.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: Mattis also resigned in 2018, citing fundamental [disagreements with President Trump’s military policies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46640114).
1.4.5.6.2.1.2. Con: Mattis later agreed on [the need to view space "as a warfighting domain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pence-details-plan-for-creation-of-space-force-in-what-would-be-the-sixth-branch-of-the-military/2018/08/09/0b40b8d0-9bdc-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html)(“at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting functions.")".
1.4.5.6.2.2. Con: Even James Mattis warned against the creation of the Space Force due to budgetary concerns, he later [supported it](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/400781-mattis-pentagon-white-house-in-complete-agreement-on-space-force).
1.4.5.6.3. Pro: In December 2019, President Trump signed the 2020 [National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.space.com/trump-creates-space-force-2020-defense-bill.html) which directed the establishment of the [U.S. Space Force](https://www.space.com/42089-space-force.html) as the sixth branch of the armed forces.
1.4.5.6.4. Con: The [Air Force Space Command](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-space-force-is-dumb-says-nasa-astronaut-2018-6?r=US&IR=T)(But retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly — a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, four-time space-flyer, and the identical twin brother of the former astronaut Scott Kelly — doesn't support the plan, and some members of Congress have also voiced their distaste for the idea.\n\n"This is a dumb idea. The Air Force does this already. That is their job," Mark Kelly tweeted in June, following Trump's remarks. "What's next, we move submarines to the 7th branch and call it the 'under-the-sea force?'"\n\n\[...\]\n\nKelly was referring to the Air Force Space Command, though the group has had different names over the years.\n\nSpace Command is headquartered in Colorado, and its responsibilities include supporting military use of satellites, rocket launches, and cyberwarfare operations. The group also helps track the countless pieces of space junk and debris around Earth that pose a persistent threat to anything in orbit.) already existed when President Trump proposed the Space Force.
1.4.5.7. Pro: The US military had more accomplishments under President Trump's administration than in previous ones.
1.4.5.7.1. Pro: A notable victory for the military under President Trump was defeating ISIS's caliphate and [killing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50200339) in 2019.
1.4.5.7.2. Pro: President Trump managed to get other [NATO](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/01/19/trumps-biggest-military-accomplishments-as-president-so-far-according-to-the-gop/) member countries to commit to increasing their financial contribution to the military alliance, as [promised](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1386/ask-countries-we-protect-pay-more-for-joint-defens/).
1.4.5.7.3. Con: President Obama eliminated the leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the [9/11 terrorist attacks](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-9-11-attacks-still-affect-the-economy-today-3305536).
1.4.5.7.4. Con: President Obama repealed the "[Don't ask, don't tell](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/09/20/archives-end-dont-ask-dont-tell)(In 2011, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was finally and formally repealed, allowing gay and lesbian service members to serve openly in our nation’s armed forces.)" policy in 2011.
1.4.5.8. Con: The military was already far stronger than necessary. It was just a waste of money.
1.4.5.8.1. Pro: Exponentially expanding the military reach and expanding an army's operations are historically unbecoming of great empires, such as Rome. [Researchers believe the U.S. is heading in a similar direction.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG362.html)
1.4.5.8.2. Pro: As of May 2020, the US military spent [more than the next 10 nations combined](https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison), of which some are allies or close NATO member-states.
1.4.5.9. Con: President Trump's undermining of the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice) \(UCMJ\) with his [pardons of US war criminals](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-continues-to-pardon-war-criminals-in-iraq-afghanistan/2088191) were a detriment to morale and order.
1.4.5.10. Pro: Service-members had a more favorable view of President Trump, which will likely improve their morale and service.
1.4.5.10.1. Pro: Only [40%](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2017/10/23/military-times-poll-what-you-really-think-about-trump/) of service-members had a negative view of the President.
1.4.5.10.1.1. Con: Considering how unpopular President Trump was with the public, this statistic doesn't say much. The survey also shows that the majority of officers disapproved of President Trump, with only 30% supporting him.
1.4.5.10.1.1.1. Pro: The only branch of the army where President Trump enjoyed a favorability of over 50% was the Marines, and that was because the Marines loved [Mattis](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/10/22/trump-saint-mattis-and-war-marines-are-still-big-fans-even-as-the-other-branches-wane/), President Trump's cabinet pick.
1.4.5.10.1.2. Con: This has changed. 50% of servicemembers had a negative view as of [December 2019](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/12/17/half-of-active-duty-service-members-are-unhappy-with-trump-new-military-times-poll-shows/), and it's [likely slipped further](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-polls-military-approval.html) after he announced intentions to use the military against BLM protesters, and other actions.
1.4.5.10.1.3. Con: 40% is a substantial amount of the American population.
1.4.5.10.2. Con: Many veterans were [horrified](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amvets-trump-mccain-death_n_5b840313e4b03485860253fd) by President Trump's actions towards Sen. John McCain, to the point of the unprecedented step of drafting and sending a letter demanding that he follow protocol.
1.4.5.10.2.1. Pro: President Trump had a long history of [disparaging the military service](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-under-fire-for-alleged-comments-about-veterans-has-a-long-history-of-disparaging-military-service/2020/09/06/76aba4b8-f053-11ea-9279-45d6bdfe145f_story.html), even though he claimed he had done [more for veterans than John McCain](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/04/politics/fact-check-trump-mccain-loser-veterans-choice/index.html) did.
1.4.5.10.3. Con: Given the [increase in defence spending under Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54060026), servicemen were unlikely to be objective in their view.
1.4.5.10.3.1. Pro: In 2018, President Trump requested Congress for [$639 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States) in military spending, which represented a 10% increase since 2017.
1.4.5.10.4. Con: This didn't necessarily mean that President Trump's military policies were sound. Service members' higher rates of support would also be the case if service members were more likely to be Republican in the first place.
1.5. Con: President Trump had low [public](https://news.gallup.com/poll/328637/last-trump-job-approval-average-record-low.aspx)(WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As President Donald Trump prepares to leave the White House, 34% of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president, the worst evaluation of his presidency. His 41% average approval rating throughout his presidency is four points lower than for any of his predecessors in Gallup's polling era. Trump's ratings showed a record 81-percentage-point average gap between Republicans and Democrats -- 11 points wider than the prior record.) and [expert](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html) approval.
1.5.1. Con: It is not uncommon for presidents who end up being popular to go through periods of unpopularity and polarisation.
1.5.1.1. Pro: President Trump's approval rating after the first 486 days of his presidency was [the same as Reagan's](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo) and Carter's.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Abraham Lincoln was deeply [unpopular](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/evidence-unpopular-mr-lincoln)(At the time he was sworn in, Lincoln's "approval rating" can be estimated by examining wintertime Republican losses in local elections in Brooklyn, Cincinnati, Cleveland and St. Louis, and state elections in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island; by the observations of Henry Adams \(of the presidential Adamses\) that "not a third of the House" supported him; and by the published reckoning of the New York Herald that only 1 million of the 4.7 million who voted in November were still with him. All these indications put his support in the nation at about 25 percent — roughly equivalent to the lowest approval ratings recorded by modern-day polling.) for much of his life. He is now routinely ranked as [the greatest president of all time](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/who-was-worst-president-everand-how-do-historians-decide-180978105/)(By comparison, Buchanan’s successor, Abraham Lincoln, maintained his tight grip on the top spot for leading the nation through the Civil War and abolishing slavery. He’s the standalone figure in a string of worst-ranked presidents that stretches from 1837 to 1869, notes the Post.\n\nIn general, time tends to be on the side of presidents like Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower, who were unpopular with historians at the time of leaving office but are highly ranked on 2021’s survey, as participant and Lyndon Johnson historian Mark K. Updegrove points out in a New York Times op-ed. With regards to recent presidents, George W. Bush debuted at 36th place in 2009 but jumped 7 places this year to spot 29; and Barack Obama rose two spots to break into the top 10 presidents this year.).
1.5.1.3. Con: The major difference was the starting approval. [President Trump's approval started under 50%](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-the-most-unpopular-president-since-ford-to-run-for-reelection/) \(with 42.6\) and he ended his presidency with [58% of disapproval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).
1.5.2. Pro: A [survey of 391 political experts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html) from the [American Political Science Association](https://www.apsanet.org/ABOUT/About-APSA)(Founded in 1903, the American Political Science Association \(APSA\) is the leading professional organization for the study of political science and serves more than 11,000 members in more than 100 countries.

The Association promotes a lively, diverse community of scholars, teachers, students, and practitioners who bring wide-ranging interests, methodologies, and perspectives to the analysis and conduct of government and politics.) ranked him as the worst President.
1.5.2.1. Con: He was much better than the alternative of [Hilary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton), and so could be comparatively considered, a good President.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: This is all speculative. We can't know how Clinton would have performed given that she [was never elected President](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/07/the-night-they-cant-forget-hillary-clinton-supporters-recall-the-election).
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: A better comparison would be to [past,](https://www.businessinsider.com/greatest-us-presidents-ranked-by-political-scientists-2018-2#40-andrew-johnson-5) or best [historic](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-20-presidents-in-us-history-according-to-historians-2017-2#10-lyndon-b-johnson-11) [presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States) in US history.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a comparison against past presidents, President Trump has ranked as "[last in 'Presidential Greatness](https://time.com/5165686/donald-trump-last-place-presidential-greatness/)'.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [top 5 best presidents in US history](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html) are considered to be: Lincoln, Washington, F.D. Roosevelt, T. Roosevelt, and Jefferson.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [top 5 worst presidents in US history](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html) are considered to be: \(from worst to "best"\): Trump, Buchanan, Harding, W.H.Harrison, A. Johnson and Pierce.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: [US society has become more diverse](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/how-diverse-is-america/) with time, and it is very hard for a single person to "[represent the varied, competing interests of 327 million citizens.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/a-broken-office/556883/)(No one man—or woman—can possibly represent the varied, competing interests of 327 million citizens.)"
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: In comparison to past Presidents, there has never been more [political polarization than during Trump's presidency](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/03/20/comparing-trump-to-the-greatest-and-the-most-polarizing-presidents-in-u-s-history/).
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The US has gone through a [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) in the past, implying that polarization has had historically worse highs.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: 'Presidential Greatness' is not a meaningfully measurable or objective ranking that gives us any insight into President Trump.
1.5.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The political, economic, and social contexts of US history have evolved with time, therefore [comparing presidents wouldn't be accurate](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/03/20/comparing-trump-to-the-greatest-and-the-most-polarizing-presidents-in-u-s-history/).
1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: According to some experts, "[Clinton would not have been able to do much even with the large powers of the presidency.](https://www.econlib.org/counterfactuals-what-if-clinton-had-won-in-2016/)"
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Being better than alternatives did not make President Trump a "good President".
1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: If good is the thing which produces the best outcomes in a given scenario, than being better than the only alternative would make the object good.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: Hillary Clinton would have been a worse President than Donald Trump.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: Hillary's campaign conspired with foreign intelligence operatives and [top Justice Department officials](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bruce-ohr-bypassed-doj-superiors-to-feed-fbi-info-from-trump-dossier-author-report) to undermine the election by funding an [unverifiable propaganda document](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Russia_dossier) for the purpose of undermining a presidential nominee. The conceit this shows indicates Hillary would have been a worse President.
1.5.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Unverifiable in places, but [never disproved](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier). Indeed, more and more has been proven true over time, and the intelligence community has been and is investigating the allegations.
1.5.2.1.3.1.2. Con: It is perfectly common practise to engage in smear campaigns during Presidential elections; Trump did precisely the same thing in reverse with his nickname "[Crooked Hillary](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/whats-wrong-with-the-democrats/528696/)".
1.5.2.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.2.
1.5.2.1.3.1.3. Con: Given the level of President [Trump's own arrogance](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-president-wins-us-election-2016-who-is-he-life-career-quotes-hillary-clinton-a7402211.html), this is not the best line of argument. Regardless of how valid or invalid Hillary's actions were, to criticise her conceit in comparison to President Trump is challenging.
1.5.2.1.3.1.4. Con: The initial research that preceded and, speculatively, may have later led to the Steele Dossier was actually commissioned by Republicans and later picked up by the Democrats, as the [timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier) of Republican and Democrat funding for Fusion GPS indicates.
1.5.2.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Christopher Steele was not [hired or commissioned to work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier) on the Steele Dossier until after the Republicans had ceased funding. As such, it is unclear how much of the initial research from their funding went into it or even would have led to it.
1.5.2.1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: At what point Fusion GPS decided to contract Steele is unclear. It may have been when they were still on the Republican payroll, though it is an undisputed fact that his research did not begin until after the Republicans ceased payment.
1.5.2.1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: However, under the assumption that when Republican funding ceased, it meant that whatever [Fusion GPS were doing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html) for the Republicans also stopped, it can be said almost conclusively that the Republicans didn't fund the Steele dossier.
1.5.2.1.3.1.4.2. Con: This speculation is inconsistent with what the republican group, Free Beacon, has said. [Namely:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Russia_dossier)"All of the work that Fusion GPS provided to the Free Beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that the Free Beacon received appears in the Steele dossier. The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele."
1.5.2.1.3.2. Pro: Hillary ran on a platform of [continuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign) of Obama's presidency. Therefore it was reasonable to consider that the unexpected economic and jobs boom attributable to President Trump's policy changes on tax and regulations would not have happened had Hillary been president.
1.5.2.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.5.3.5.2.1.5.1.
1.5.2.1.3.3. Pro: Hillary was foreign secretary under President Obama, and in that time [achieved zero breakthroughs](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron) with North Korea. Therefore it was reasonable to consider that the improved dialogue and behaviour of North Korea would not have happened had Hillary been elected.
1.5.2.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.6.3.8.1.
1.5.2.2. Pro: According to some [historians](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/is-donald-trump-the-worst-us-president-ever-historians-say-so-20210115-p56u9w.html), President Trump was the worst President in US history.
1.5.2.3. Pro: When asked, even [conservative scholars](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46895634)(Though the president has likened himself to Abraham Lincoln, who posterity has deemed to be greatest of all presidents, this survey judged him to be the worst of the worst. Even the conservative scholars, who identified themselves as Republicans, placed him 40th.), who would identify themselves as Republicans, placed President Trump in the 40th position of the worst US Presidents.
1.5.2.4. Con: In 2014 Obama was rated by 33% of participants in a poll as the [worst president since World War II.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/07/02/obama-george-w-bush-quinnipiac-poll-reagan-clinton/11985837/)
1.5.2.4.1. Con: These numbers don't imply a genuine negative consensus, as 67% of respondents didn't believe Obama was the worst president since World War II.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: A genuine negative consensus is precisely what you would expect from biased people expressing cognitive dissonance.
1.5.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The referenced poll includes Democrat, Independent, and Republican scholars. In all groups, President Trump was rated in the bottom five, indicating that political bias was less of a factor in the results.
1.5.2.4.1.2. Pro: This is an old poll. In 2018 the [same group repeated it](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/03/07/quinnipiac-poll-41-say-trump-worst-president-since-world-war-ii/404118002/) and President Trump was at the top with 41% as compared to President Obama at 21%.
1.5.2.4.1.2.1. Con: This group has rated the current sitting President at the time as the worst each time they have voted.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: Less than two years into a presidency is too soon to be making such pronouncements. This survey shows the bias of the so-called "political experts" surveyed.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Con: The poll cited regarding Obama was not by political experts in any way or form; those with [qualifications from APSA](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2056)(The American Political Science Association \(APSA\).) are considerably more valid than popularity contests.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that the views of people with 'qualifications' from the 'APSA' are more valid than those of other people on this question. Having a common qualification is however suggestive of common bias.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Having a qualification in a subject implies that a person can judge considerably more accurately.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The bias amongst humanities subjects and politics towards left-wing ideology is [well known,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/03/02/eight-ten-british-university-lecturers-left-wing-survey-finds/) and so this result is precisely what would be predicted based on bias alone.
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Specific tools are required in order to understand and judge the [complexity of political phenomena](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286362106_Expert_Political_Judgment_How_Good_is_It_How_can_We_Know).
1.5.2.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: There was no evidence given that recipients of this qualification would give more objective answers to this question, or that they were notably intelligent. Their willingness to answer in this way before even President Trump's first term indicated the opposite was true.
1.5.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.4.1.1.1.
1.5.2.4.2.2. Pro: A "political qualification" does not indicate that someone is free of bias.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.
1.5.4. Pro: President Trump seemed untrustworthy because he didn't seem to know what he was talking about at any given time.
1.5.4.1. Pro: President Trump showed [very little knowledge](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/17/15304212/trump-ignorant) or experience in many issues associated with being an effective president, which was reflected in his speeches and public statements.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: President Trump's quotes on [mental health](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-mental-illness_n_57583b02e4b0ced23ca691b5?guccounter=1) demonstrated no understanding of the issue, folding both to stigma and misinformation.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Many quotes given in the support article don’t demonstrate this at all, and many people would agree with them. For example, the [link between mental illness and mass shootings.](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-duwe-rocque-mass-shootings-mental-illness-20180223-story.html)
1.5.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There's a link between illness and crime. [One-third of mass shootings are committed by people with mental illness](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/08/08/one-third-of-mass-shootings-committed-by-people-with-mental-illness-study-says).
1.5.4.1.1.1.2. Con: A strong causal link between mental illness and mass shootings is [demonstrably untrue](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099) despite being a [common](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/minding-the-mind/201802/mass-shooting-and-the-myth-the-violent-mentally-ill) [misconception](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/fact-check-parkland-gun-violence-mental-illness.html).
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that mass shootings are linked to mental illness is a proven [criminal myth](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180509-is-there-a-link-between-mass-shooting-and-mental-illness).
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: There is a causal link between [serious mental illness and violence](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9133.12473).
1.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: The National Alliance on Mental Illness expressed [serious concerns](https://www.nami.org/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2018/NAMI-s-Statement-Regarding-President-Trump-s-Recen) about President Trump's attitude to mental health.
1.5.4.1.1.3. Pro: President Trump continually drew [false parallels](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-devastating-mental-health-policies-rhetoric) between criminality and mental health, when this is utterly false.
1.5.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: [Only 3-5% of violent acts](https://namimc.org/media-perpetuating-dangerous-myth-mental-illness/) can be attributed to mental illness.
1.5.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: "You have people that are mentally ill. And they're gonna come through the cracks. And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible." - this was an example of President Trump's gross misrepresentation of people with mental health problems. \([Meet the Press, 4/10/15](https://www.shortlist.com/news/most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443)\)
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Caught on the spot, President Trump couldn't formulate a speech. He abused clichés and occasionally [repeated himself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/15/this-video-of-donald-trump-repeating-himself-is-pretty-great-video/).
1.5.4.1.3. Con: President Trump has been actively involved in US trade and foreign policy for at [least 30 years](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ilanbenmeir/that-time-trump-spent-nearly-100000-on-an-ad-criticizing-us).
1.5.4.1.3.1. Con: There are good arguments to be made that neither his handling of [international issues](https://www.kialo.com/trumps-foreign-policy-achievements-demonstrate-he-is-a-good-president-6079.48?path=6079.0~6079.1_6079.48), nor of the [domestic economy](https://www.kialo.com/trumps-stewardship-and-policies-have-led-to-historic-economic-achievements-across-a-number-of-different-metrics-6079.544?path=6079.0~6079.1_6079.1891_6079.544) can be considered successful.
1.5.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.2.
1.5.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: President Trump took many short-sighted, one-off decisions that resulted in the worsening of international issues.
1.5.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.5.4.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The embassy in Jerusalem and North Korean nuclear talks are great examples of President Trump taking one-off foreign policy decisions. \([p. 47](https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/CSR%2084_Blackwill_Trump.pdf)\)
1.5.4.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.4.2.
1.5.4.1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Neither of these actions have borne any significant fruit or have set any long-term actionable policy that could be considered achievements with lasting positive effects for US foreign policy. \([p. 68](https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/CSR%2084_Blackwill_Trump.pdf)\)

1.5.4.1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.5.7.
1.5.4.1.3.2. Pro: President Trump’s success with specific international issues, like [North Korea](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-48815938), suggested that he had knowledge and experience in issues associated with being an effective President.
1.5.4.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.6.3.9.
1.5.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: Korea expert, [Victor Cha](http://time.com/5294880/south-north-korea-ambassador-talks-summit-victor-cha/), gave credits to President Trump for the negotiations.
1.5.4.1.4. Pro: President Trump's grasp on nuclear proliferation and nuclear fission [was cause for concern among many experts.](http://fortune.com/video/2018/01/03/trumps-history-with-nuclear-weapons/)
1.5.4.2. Pro: President Trump said some [patently](https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/people/donald-trump-quotes-57213) [bizarre](https://www.shortlist.com/news/the-50-most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443), [outrageous](https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-quotes-2733859), [stupid](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-change/donald-trump-stupid-quotes), [and](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-most-outrageous-quotes-since-taking-office/) [ridiculous](https://cheezburger.com/614917/funny-memes-top-10-most-ridiculous-donald-trump-quotes) [things](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-quotes-tweets-what-11839860).
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: President Trump's statements frequently displayed arrogance.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Con: Many of President Trump's supporters claimed that the [US needed an arrogant President](https://www.expressnews.com/news/news_columnists/gilbert_garcia/article/Local-Trump-supporters-remain-on-board-14515082.php).
1.5.4.2.2.2. Pro: "We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration" was a statement of sheer arrogance, particularly ironic in retrospect given [how few turned up](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347298/trump-inauguration-crowd-size).
1.5.4.2.2.2.1. Con: The explanation of the confusion was later explained because the crowd looked big from "[President Trump’s vantage point at the Capitol](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/24/14354036/crowds-presidential-inaugurations-trump-average)."
1.5.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: President Trump [stole a photo](https://time.com/4641324/trump-inauguration-twitter-photo/) from Obama's inauguration to make it appear as though he attracted a larger crowd.
1.5.4.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.12.1.2.
1.5.4.2.2.4. Pro: "My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth." This is an example of a ridiculous \(and arrogant\) [statement](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/258584864163500033?lang=en), insofar that it was neither true nor likely to ever be true.
1.5.4.2.2.5. Pro: "My IQ is one of the highest — and you all know it! Please don’t feel so stupid or insecure; it’s not your fault." and "I'm intelligent. Some people would say I'm very, very, very intelligent." are two quotes that demonstrate arrogance and have no backing; in fact, analysis has suggested that President Trump spoke at the level of an [8-year-old](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-language-level-speaking-skills-age-eight-year-old-vocabulary-analysis-a8149926.html).
1.5.4.2.2.5.1. Pro: [President Trump](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-us-flag-wrong-colour-blue-stripe-a8508556.html) managed to [colour](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/aug/27/trump-new-american-flag-russian-twist-us-president-drawing-children-ohio) the [American](https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/donald-trump-colours-us-flag-wrong-gets-trolled-online-5328891/) [flag](https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/27/donald-trump-used-the-wrong-colour-while-drawing-the-american-flag-7885223/) [incorrectly](https://www.firstpost.com/world/twitter-has-a-field-day-as-donald-trump-adds-wrong-colours-to-american-flag-during-visit-to-ohio-childrens-hospital-5059221.html).
1.5.4.2.2.5.2. Pro: President Trump claimed to be "[a very stable genius](https://www.indy100.com/article/trump-very-stable-genius-nato-uk-visit-8443776)", but refused to be independently tested on this.
1.5.4.2.3. Con: Many of the examples given are being deliberately misinterpreted or exaggerated. President Trump's unique communication style meant that people who were predisposed to hate him could easily interpret them in the worst possible light.
1.5.4.2.3.1. Pro: President Trump did not generalise that [all Mexicans are rapists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/).
1.5.4.2.3.2. Pro: President Trump [refused to bow to political correctness](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/12/14/505324427/politically-correct-the-phrase-has-gone-from-wisdom-to-weapon).
1.5.4.2.4. Pro: "[Any negative polls are fake news](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-any-negative-polls-are-fake-news)" is an alarming statement nodding towards the conspiracy theory of 'fake news'. For any statesman to outright deny anything that contradicts their worldview - regardless of legitimacy - shows a lack of professional integrity. It is conceivable that negative polls exist, and are accurate.
1.5.4.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.1.2.1.2.
1.5.4.2.5. Pro: "[Ariana Huffington is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man – he made a good decision](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donald-trump-calls-arianna-huffington-365782)" - personal insults of this manner came across as petty, unpleasant, and unbecoming of a statesman, regardless of whether anybody perceived it as true.
1.5.4.2.5.1. Pro: "[If I were running ‘The View’, I’d fire Rosie O’Donnell. I mean, I’d look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, I’d say ‘Rosie, you’re fired.](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=7mtaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT22&lpg=PT22&dq=If+I+were+running+%E2%80%98The+View%E2%80%99,+I%E2%80%99d+fire+Rosie+O%E2%80%99Donnell.+I+mean,+I%E2%80%99d+look+at+her+right+in+that+fat,+ugly+face+of+hers,+I%E2%80%99d+say+%E2%80%98Rosie,+you%E2%80%99re+fired.&source=bl&ots=F9XsizRPLL&sig=ACfU3U23xyp-7tscUWUxLXgxfut4kAtV6w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjfv821nI_sAhWF3YUKHXRvDgkQ6AEwBHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=If%20I%20were%20running%20%E2%80%98The%20View%E2%80%99%2C%20I%E2%80%99d%20fire%20Rosie%20O%E2%80%99Donnell.%20I%20mean%2C%20I%E2%80%99d%20look%20at%20her%20right%20in%20that%20fat%2C%20ugly%20face%20of%20hers%2C%20I%E2%80%99d%20say%20%E2%80%98Rosie%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20fired.&f=false)" - similarly, to call anybody 'fat' and 'ugly' is not the conduct one expects from a public figure.
1.5.4.2.5.2. Pro: He did the same with [Hillary Clinton](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-via-twitter-hillary-clinton-cant-satisfy-her-husband-2015-4?IR=T), with "If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America". Campaign or not, this was very crude and problematic from a statesman.
1.5.4.2.5.3. Pro: Similarly with Rand Paul: "[I never attacked him on his looks, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-rand-paul-debate-2015-9)"
1.5.4.2.6. Pro: "[When Mexico sends its people,... they’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists…](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mexicans-rapists-remark-reference-2018-4)" - this was outright racist, to generalise an entire racial group in such negative terms.
1.5.4.2.6.1. Pro: This is also [inaccurate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/30/upshot/crime-immigration-myth.html). Immigration and criminality are not correlated as President Trump would have liked.
1.5.4.2.6.1.1. Pro: It has been shown that undocumented immigrants are actually half as likely to [be arrested for violent crimes as U.S.-born citizens](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/undocumented-immigrants-are-half-as-likely-to-be-arrested-for-violent-crimes-as-u-s-born-citizens/).
1.5.4.2.6.1.2. Con: He was talking about illegal immigration, which is by definition [criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States). It was therefore accurate.
1.5.4.2.6.1.2.1. Con: Even if we accept the premise that he meant the crime of illegally entering a country when referring to their criminality, this does not explain references to drugs and rape.
1.5.4.2.6.1.2.2. Pro: Illegally entering a country can be both convicted as a crime and held responsible for a civil violation under the [U.S. immigration laws](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/us-immigration/crime-enter-illegally.html).
1.5.4.2.6.2. Con: This quote didn't generalise to all illegal Mexican immigrants, because the quote had been truncated to cut out the part where he said that he assumed [some of the illegal immigrants were good people](https://scholarship.rollins.edu/honors/123/).
1.5.4.2.6.2.1. Con: President Trump has been known to generalise about other incidents in the past too.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Most politicians generalize. [Clinton also generalized about Trump's supporters](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/clinton-was-wrong-to-generalize-about-trumps-supporters/499499/).
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.2. Con: Generalising is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: In light of the protests and counter-protests in [Charlottesville](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/), he tarred both sides with the same brush, equating the protesters of ANTIFA on the left, with [White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) on the right. This drew a lot of criticism of President Trump.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: The rally was organised by [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer), a white supremacist. The rally was white supremacist, antisemitic, white separatist, and neo-fascist.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: President Trump later amended his statement to say that there were "[some fine, very fine people, on both sides](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/)", again a sweeping generalisation.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: These comments were seen by critics as implying moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and those who protested against them.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Although there were undoubtedly some innocent and/or peaceful protesters on the right, many of the marchers [chanted racist and antisemitic slogans](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/charlottesville-violence-from-nazi-slogans-to-counter-protests-heres-what-happened-in-the-virginia-city-4794475/), carried semi-automatic rifles, swastikas, Nazi symbols etc. Because of this, many feel he has said there are "very fine" Neo-Nazis/Nazi sympathisers.
1.5.4.2.6.2.1.3.2. Pro: In his first statement on the rally, President Trump did not denounce white nationalists explicitly, instead he condemned "hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides".
1.5.4.2.6.2.2. Pro: President Trump was expressly only talking about the subset of [Mexicans who choose to illegally sneak into the US](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12141/w12141.pdf), saying that they were not the best Mexico had to offer. \(p. 2\)
1.5.4.2.6.2.2.1. Pro: In 2019, [43% of the 11.6 million immigrants from Mexico](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/28/what-we-know-about-illegal-immigration-from-mexico/) living in the United States were in the country illegally.
1.5.4.2.6.2.2.2. Con: To generalise any group - even passingly - as [rapists is unacceptable](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916).
1.5.4.2.7. Pro: "One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace. Good people don’t go into government." - this was deeply ironic, and thus fairly ridiculous.
1.5.4.2.7.1. Con: This is a widely held belief, and it is unclear what is bizarre or ridiculous about this quote.
1.5.4.2.7.1.1. Con: What is ridiculous is the person who said it went into politics himself.
1.5.4.2.8. Pro: "[The point is, you can never be too greedy](http://uk.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-business-philosophy-from-the-art-of-the-deal-2015-6)." - this is self-explanatory insofar as President Trump's moral standards and priorities.
1.5.4.2.9. Pro: "I was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen, down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down” - mistake or not, to wrongly [post](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/americas/i-watched-our-police-and-our-firemen-down-at-711-donald-trumps-embarrassing-slipup-as-he-confuses-convenience-chain-store-with-911-34639665.html) in public about such a huge disaster is problematic for a President.
1.5.4.2.9.1. Pro: President Trump's statements regarding 9/11 have been [very disrespectful](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-bizarre-quotes-911-attacks-tallest-building-higher-ratings-muslims-cheering-george-w-a8530571.html) and at points seemingly self-serving.
1.5.4.2.9.1.1. Pro: This includes saying that he believes he "could have stopped it" through [immigration measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/us/politics/trump-911-speech.html), which is both implausible and disrespectful to the victims.
1.5.4.2.10. Pro: He also attributed "'Make America Great Again" to himself, despite it being [Reagan's campaign slogan](https://www.shortlist.com/news/most-ridiculous-trump-quotes-ever/54443).
1.5.4.2.11. Con: Not all of these quotes are wrong; President Trump said that he has a "[great relationship with African Americans" and" great respect for them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/23/donald-trumps-intriguing-comments-about-sandra-bland-yes-really/)." This was true with [opinion polls](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/16/trump-approval-rating-african-americans-rasmussen-poll/1013212002/) showing vastly elevated African-American support since his election.
1.5.4.2.12. Pro: His statement “[Why are we having all these people from shithole countries coming here](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/11/trump-pans-immigration-proposal-as-bringing-people-from-shithole-countries)?” was prejudicial and inappropriate for a President.
1.5.4.3. Con: Politicians not knowing what they are talking about is hardly unusual.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: Just because there is precident, doesn't mean that it is right.
1.5.4.4. Con: 39% of Americans thought [the US was on the "right track"](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/10/17147338/donald-trump-illiberal-undemocratic-elections-politics)(Despite 3.9 percent unemployment, a booming stock market, and relative peace abroad, only 38 percent of people say the country is on the “right track.” A Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found that 71 percent of Americans believe our “problems have reached a dangerous new low.) in 2018.
1.5.4.5. Pro: President Trump had [no understanding of climate change](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/climate-change/donald-trump-stupid-quotes).
1.5.4.5.1. Con: Climate science is exceptionally complicated, therefore it is not unreasonable to express skepticism.
1.5.4.5.1.1. Con: It is alarming that President Trump - who was in a position to [withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement) - was so patently not in possession of even basic facts.
1.5.4.5.2. Con: President Trump, like most politicians, was not a scientist, and like him, very few politicians have a reasonable understanding of climate change.
1.5.4.5.2.1. Pro: [Climate science](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/good-climate-science-is-all-about-nuance-good-politics-is-not/) is very hard to understand and integrate into politics.

1.5.4.5.4. Pro: President Trump attempted to argue that global warming was a [Chinese hoax](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidvolodzko/2019/02/23/manufacturing-climate-denial-is-a-threat-to-manufacturing/#3e19c9ad21b9)(The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\n\n — Donald J.

1.5.4.5.4.1.2. Con: President Trump admitted in 2018 that [climate change wasn't a hoax](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17977596/donald-trump-climate-change-hoax-60-minutes-interview).
1.5.4.5.4.2. Con: In 2009, Trump signed [a full-page advert in the New York Times](https://grist.org/politics/donald-trump-climate-action-new-york-times/), expressing his support for legislation [combating climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51213003).
1.5.4.5.5. Pro: President Trump denied that climate change is a lasting problem and believed it will "[fix itself](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/15/itll-change-back-trump-says-climate-change-not-a-hoax-but-denies-lasting-impact)", countering science and blaming scientists for having their own "[agenda](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45859325)".
1.5.4.5.5.1. Pro: President Trump's [denial of climate change](https://psmag.com/environment/trumps-impact-on-the-environment) was [globally harmful.](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)
1.5.4.5.5.2. Con: President Trump publicly acknowledged the [role of humans in climate change](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-politics-b5ae9468286d92f44c6a10d1e6d2cad0)(Trump said \[...\] that humans — their tailpipe exhaust, oil and gas production, and smokestack fumes — are just one of many culprits for the weather-disrupting deterioration of Earth’s atmosphere.).
1.5.4.6. Pro: President Trump had a [flawed](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/07/why-donald-trumps-trade-war-will-fail/564605/) [understanding](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-trade-war_us_5ac53929e4b09ef3b2432f64) of [economics](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-seems-confused-about-whos-paying-for-his-trade-war) and international politics.
1.5.4.6.1. Pro: President Trump thought that trade wars were [good things](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/trump-is-said-to-delay-decision-on-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs) and [easy to win](http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-trade-fight-20180625-story.html).
1.5.4.6.2. Con: Some of [President Trump's formulas for growing the U.S. economy](https://www.brookings.edu/research/trumps-formula-for-growing-the-u-s-economy-what-will-work-and-what-wont/) worked, which showed his understanding of economics.
1.5.4.6.3. Con: President Trump’s position towards [Brexit and towards the European Union showed opportunism](https://journals.openedition.org/lisa/10235?lang=en), which was a sign that he understood foreign affairs and international politics.
1.5.4.6.3.1. Pro: President Trump had a clear [foreign policy ideology](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/35011) which, like all American presidents, drew on nationalism and opportunism.
1.5.4.6.3.2. Con: His statements [regarding Brexit](http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-doesnt-understand-brexit-or-basic-trade-policy-2017-7?r=US&IR=T) suggested that he had a limited understanding of such issues.

1.5.5. Con: It is impossible to judge the public approval of President Trump by media charts and ‘expert’ panels.
1.5.5.1. Pro: [Before the 2016 election](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/), the media made it look as though Trump had little public popularity when compared with Clinton. This was proven false by the voter outcome.
1.5.5.2. Con: The 2020 election was the largest possible poll of approval and in that election Trump lost by a significant margin, becoming one of only [10 US presidents in history to fail to get reelected](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/how-many-us-presidents-lost-second-term-b1640998.html).
1.5.5.2.1. Con: Even though he lost the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump still earned the [second-highest number of votes](https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers)(Biden won 81,283,098 votes, or 51.3 percent of the votes cast. He is the first U.S. presidential candidate to have won more than 80 million votes. Trump won 74,222,958 votes, or 46.8 percent of the votes cast. That’s more votes than any other presidential candidate has ever won, with the exception of Biden. \(Third-party candidates picked up 1.8 percent of the votes cast.\)) of any presidential candidate in history.
1.5.6. Pro: He did not get the [majority of votes](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/). He won because of the [voting system in the US](https://www.usa.gov/election).
1.5.6.1. Con: This doesn't mean that he had low approval ratings, this means that he had enough approval to trigger the [exception of the voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College).
1.5.6.2. Con: Other candidates have won the presidency [without a majority of votes](https://time.com/5579161/presidents-elected-electoral-college/)(No matter whether the Electoral College changes or stays in place, however, the Electoral College has already left an indelible mark on some of the most consequential moments in American history, determining who was in power during the Sept. 11 attacks and the Reconstruction period after the Civil War.\n\nHere’s a full list of Presidents elected by the Electoral College without winning the popular vote.).
1.5.6.3. Pro: Hillary Clinton received [nearly three million more votes](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president) than Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
1.5.7. Con: This is an appeal to popularity or "[argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)(An argumentum ad populum \(Latin for "appeal to the people"\) is a fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: "If many believe so, it is so".)" \(appeal to the people\) which is a common logical fallacy.
1.5.7.1. Con: Effectiveness in terms of a democratically elected head of state can only be measured in the [representativeness of the public will](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053006.190533)(The topic of political representation hasbecome increasingly visible and importantwithin contemporary democratic theory fortwo reasons. The first is a disjunction betweenthe standard accounts of democratic repre-sentation, focused primarily on territoriallybased electoral representation, and an increas-ingly complex political terrain, which is lessconfined within state territoriality, more plu-ralized, and increasingly dependent on infor-mal negotiation and deliberation to generatepolitical legitimacy.). \(p. 388\)
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Political polarization has increased "[partisan motivated reasoning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-019-09539-8)(Due to changes in the US political environment in the last few decades, we suspect that the relative importance of these components has changed over time. In particular, we argue that polarization has increased partisan motivated reasoning when it comes to evaluations of the president.)" regarding any president's evaluations.
1.5.7.2. Pro: [People are influenced by the media](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spsr.12263)(Due to their role as intermediaries between the political system and the public, mediaorganizations and journalists who produce and relay content to citizens play a major rolein current democracies.), therefore public and expert approval can be manipulated. \(p. 1\)
1.5.7.2.1. Con: People are influenced by the media, however certains groups within the media overdefend Trump, which might have actually increased his popularity above what it would be in a more objective setting.
1.5.7.2.1.1. Pro: Media outlets, such as [Fox News](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/business/media/trump-fox-news.html), put out extremely positive material on Trump.
1.5.7.2.1.2. Pro: Trump was a master of mobilising the power of [ressentiment \(p. 81\)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321225465_Trump_Propaganda_and_the_Politics_of_Ressentiment) and applying it through mass and social media.
1.5.7.2.1.3. Pro: One America News Network has been accused of peddling pro-Trump propaganda to such a degree that [they are being threatened with legal action for defamation](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/trumps-biggest-propaganda-machine-doesnt-believe-its-own-lies).
1.5.7.2.1.4. Pro: With a final approval rating of just [34%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating#President_Donald_Trump), it is possible for a significant proportion of Trump's remaining support to come from media propaganda.
1.5.7.3. Con: However, [public](https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-opinion) [opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion) and [approval](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_american-government-and-politics-in-the-information-age/s11-01-what-is-public-opinion.html), as well as [public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll#:~:text=Opinion%20polls%20are%20usually%20designed,referred%20to%20as%20a%20pollster.) [opinion polls](https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-opinion/Public-opinion-and-government), are [good](https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-4-are-opinion-polls-useful-\(1946\)/is-it-important-to-know-public-opinion) [metrics](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/public-opinion-why-it-important-and-how-measure-it) as to whether someone is doing a good job and is, [subjectively](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/polling-public-opinion-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/), a "good" President.
1.5.7.3.1. Pro: Most democracies use public opinion polls, as well as popular vote for candidates in elections. This would represent public opinion and is the corner stone of a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#:~:text=Democracy%20\(Greek%3A%20%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%B1%2C%20d%C4%93mokrati%C4%81,to%20choose%20their%20governing%20legislators.).
1.5.7.3.2. Pro: Most respected and reputable opinion polls are conducted at random to try to get a representative sample and eliminate bias, thus giving a good indication of general public consensus and feeling.
1.5.7.3.2.1. Con: Many polls may be subject to [reporting bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporting_bias) and [non-response bias](https://delighted.com/blog/avoid-7-types-sampling-response-survey-bias), where only people motivated to answer do so, creating a skew in the results.
1.5.7.3.2.1.1. Pro: This was particularly evident in exit polls for both the 2016 and 2020 elections, where the media and pollsters regularly got it wrong and did not expect such tight or close races.
1.5.7.3.2.1.2. Pro: Many Republican \(and Trump\) supporters allegedly gave [false or misleading](https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/election-2020-poll-respondent-honesty/) answers, because they distrusted the pollsters and media.
1.5.7.3.2.2. Pro: Trump consistently [polled badly overall in a majority of polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/), and left office with the [lowest first-term approval of any President, ever](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/16/politics/trump-approval-analysis/index.html), with one of the lowest approval rates and one of the highest disapproval rates.
1.5.7.3.3. Pro: Public opinion and voting are used in popularity contests, pageants, and other forms of public voting. Public opinion is subjective but this is one way to realistically measure it.
1.5.7.3.4. Con: "Good" is subjective. Different people have different definitions of what is "good" compared to others.
1.6. Con: President Trump may not have been [loyal](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/could-donald-trump-really-be-spying-for-vladimir-putin-1.3604145) to the United States.
1.6.1. Con: President Trump tried his best to keep his word for what he promised his electorate.

Pro: President Trump tried his best to [build a wall](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/donald-trump-build-wall-191019103020859.html), stand up to [China](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/25/perspectives/china-trade-war-trump-winning/index.html), and bring back [jobs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/03/11/trumps-policy-magic-wand-boosts-manufacturing-jobs-399-in-first-26-months-over-obamas-last-26/#97022fc20a63), whether he succeeded in doing so or not.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: There is not enough evidence that he tried his best. Neither the amount of documentation worked through, nor work hours clocked \(and other Key Performance Indicators\) are available to the public.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Health stats are commonly available nowadays and this information is not available to the public.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: President Trump didn't care about human rights, as building a wall over the Mexican border would have been similar to the [Berlin Wall](https://www.icj.org/the-berlin-wall-a-defiance-of-human-rights/).

1.6.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.2.
1.6.1.2.5. Pro: President Trump promised to eliminate the federal debt "fairly quickly" [in an interview with Sean Hannity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jTxzmm7u8w). Instead, [the federal debt increased](https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-debt-and-how-it-got-so-big-3305778) by $3.1 trillion.
1.6.1.2.6. Pro: President Trump's infrastructure investment promises were not fulfilled.

1.6.1.2.7.2. Con: President Trump failed to cut the number of tax brackets from 7 to 3 [and later to 4](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/trump-tax-reform.pdf) as promised in his campaignplan. The final version of the tax bill was passed on Dec. 20th, 2017, and retains all 7 previous tax brackets.
1.6.1.2.7.3. Con: President Trump failed to repeal the alternative minimum tax as promised in his [tax plan](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/trump-tax-reform.pdf).
1.6.1.2.7.4. Con: Despite repeated pledges to \(eg: in [a speech](https://heavy.com/news/2016/08/donald-trump-economic-speech-detroit-michigan-full-transcript-read-text-prepared-remarks/) in Detroit\), President Trump failed to eliminate the carried interest tax loophole.

1.6.1.3.8. Con: President Trump delivered his promise [cut as many as 70% of US federal regulations if elected](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000)(The president has slashed through regulations on everything from labour to the environment.\n\nJust days after taking office he signed the Presidential Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which mandated that when government departments asked for a federal regulation, they had to specify two others they would drop.\n\nThroughout his term he has continued to slash back red tape. In January 2020 he scrapped protections for US wetlands and streams, and in July he announced changes to the National Environmental Protection Act in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects.\n\n"We are reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation that gets things done," he said.).
1.6.1.4. Con: President Trump failed to enact several promised constitutional changes.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: President Trump failed to bring back [waterboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding) or "[bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/donald-trump-waterboarding-republican-debate-torture)”. Waterboarding remains illegal.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: President Trump has failed to propose any specific action with regards to libel laws, despite promising to do so in a [rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vExmqVkv1ds) in Fort Worth, and further suggesting an intention to [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/847455180912181249).
1.6.1.4.3. Pro: Despite promising to at [a NEPBA meeting](https://youtu.be/wsLcQcjTG6k), President Trump failed to issue an executive order to mandate the death penalty for anyone who kills a police officer.
1.6.1.5. Pro: President Trump promised that he will appoint Supreme Court judges who "[respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000)(I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents.)". This was delivered by appointing [Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/trumps-two-supreme-court-justices-kavanaugh-and-gorsuch-diverge.html) to these positions.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: Respecting the Second Amendment means different things to different people.
1.6.1.5.1.1. Pro: Neither [Neil Gorsuch nor Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/judge-kavanaughs-record-on-second-amendment-gun-rights/) respected the Second Amendment in accordance with the far end of either the collective rights \(ie: banning all private ownership\), nor the individual rights \(ie: declaring all regulation of weapon-types or prohibition of criminals and the mentally ill from firearm possession as unconstitutional\).
1.6.1.5.1.2. Con: The law can't be based on [subjective interpretations.](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ucljurev12&div=22&id=&page=)

1.6.1.6.1.2. Pro: Despite [promising to do so](https://web.archive.org/web/20161110004206/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform), President Trump failed to add any price transparency provisions to the House GOP bill, nor implement any changes requiring price transparency from health care providers.
1.6.1.6.1.3. Pro: President Trump failed to allow individuals to deduct health care insurance premiums from taxes as promised on his [campaign website](https://web.archive.org/web/20161110004206/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform).
1.6.1.6.1.4. Pro: President Trump failed to administer Medicaid through block grants as promised in his campaign website's [health care reform page](https://web.archive.org/web/20161110004206/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform).
1.6.1.6.1.5. Pro: President Trump promised to [repeal Obamacare](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/?ruling=true)(“Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare."), but didn't.
1.6.1.6.1.5.1. Con: President Trump was responsible for [five big changes to Obamacare](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/14/768731628/trump-is-trying-hard-to-thwart-obamacare-hows-that-going).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.1. Pro: The [individual mandate](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/14/768731628/trump-is-trying-hard-to-thwart-obamacare-hows-that-going), by which all US residents were required to either have health insurance or pay a penalty, was eliminated by President Trump in 2017.
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Even though the $0 penalty didn't actually go into effect until 2019, it caused insurance premiums to [rise 32% on average in 2018](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/how-premiums-are-changing-in-2018/).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.2. Pro: President Trump allowed states to add "[work requirements" to Medicaid](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-what-does-the-data-say/).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: With this change, states could require Medicaid beneficiaries to [prove with documentation that they either work or go to school.](http://about:blank)
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.2.2. Con: Many [states didn't implement](http://accounts.google.com/) this change by the end of Trump's administration \(January 2021\).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.3. Pro: President Trump's administration significantly [cut federal funding](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announcement-aca-navigator-program-and-promotion-upcoming-open-enrollment) for [Navigator programs](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/navigator/).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: These programs [facilitated HealthCare.gov sign-ups](https://cdphe.colorado.gov/health-navigator/role) and helped people figure out the specifics of the new federally run insurance exchanges and sign up for coverage.
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.3.2. Con: Because of this change, the rate of uninsured Americans [increased by 7.9% in 2018](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.html)("In 2018, 8.5 percent of people, or 27.5 million, did not have health insurance at any point during the year. The uninsured rate and number of uninsured increased from 2017 \(7.9 percent or 25.6 million\).").
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.4. Pro: The limitations on [short-term insurance policies](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/03/2018-16568/short-term-limited-duration-insurance) were expanded by President Trump's administration.
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Some [states have passed their own rules](https://www.healthinsurance.org/so-long-to-limits-on-short-term-plans/#statebills) regarding these short-term or "skinny" plans, and they can either limit it or expand it.
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.4.2. Pro: The Trump administration expanded these short-term plans \(also called "skinny plans"\) to last [364 days and to be renewable for three years](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-expanding-health-coverage-options-small-businesses-workers/)("We took swift action to open short-term health plans and association health plans to millions and millions of Americans. Many of these options are already reducing the cost of health insurance premiums by up to 60% and, really, more than that." — President Trump, The White House, June 14, 2019.).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.5. Pro: [Cost-sharing reduction subsidies](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/14/557602613/trump-decision-to-end-insurance-subsidies-sparks-outrage-lawsuits) to insurers ended in 2017.
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.5.1. Con: This change forced insurers to offer subsidies to low-income people applying for insurance, however, [the federal government did not reimburse them anymore](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/14/768731628/trump-is-trying-hard-to-thwart-obamacare-hows-that-going).
1.6.1.6.1.5.1.5.2. Pro: According to President Trump, this change was applied because that money was used to [raise insurance companies' stock prices](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-prime-minister-tsipras-greece-joint-press-conference/)("I knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians. ... This is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. And they've had a record run. They've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate." — President Trump, the White House, Oct 17, 2017).
1.6.1.6.1.5.2. Pro: Instead of repealing Obamacare \([the Affordable Care Act](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-care-act/)("The comprehensive health care reform law enacted in March 2010 \(sometimes known as ACA, PPACA, or “Obamacare”\).·)\), [Republicans solidified it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/).
1.6.1.6.2. Pro: President Trump made promises with [no concern for the reality of fulfilling said promises](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/donald-trump-energy-proposals-coal-natural-gas).
1.6.1.6.3. Con: Biden already broke the promise of providing "[financially-strapped families with $2,000 stimulus](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/critics-say-bidens-covid-relief-plan-breaks-promise-of-2000-dollar-checks.html)" within the first month of his presidency.
1.6.1.7. Con: Donald Trump spent more time [golfing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/20/trumps-presidency-ends-where-so-much-it-was-spent-trump-organization-property/) during his presidency than a professional golfer.
1.6.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.11.1.
1.6.2. Pro: President Trump allegedly [colluded](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/russia-hacking-trump-mueller/565157/) with a [hostile foreign power](http://fortune.com/2018/02/17/how-russians-used-social-media-election/) to [hack US elections](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/26/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-june-2016-meeting-knowledge/index.html).
1.6.2.1. Con: Mueller [did not find enough evidence](https://www.politico.eu/article/mueller-refutes-trumps-no-collusion-no-obstruction-line/)(“We did not address ‘collusion,’ which is not a legal term,” Mueller added. “Rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy. It was not.”) to charge either Donald Trump or any of his allies with taking part in a criminal conspiracy.
1.6.2.2. Con: Allegations mean nothing without proof.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: One of the United States fundamental constitutional rights includes [Due Process](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process) \(5th and 14th amendments\). Saying a person is bad solely on an allegation is an attack on our constitution, on America, and on morality as a human race. Some of the worst examples of this can be seen in America's history when a [black man was sentenced to prison](https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/354) and even death solely on the allegations of a white woman.
1.6.2.3. Pro: A President is expected to uphold the Constitution and the law of the land. If he broke the law to become President, this should disqualify him from being considered good.
1.6.2.4. Pro: The coordination of [Russian-backed hackers](https://www.lawfareblog.com/russia-indictment-20-what-make-muellers-hacking-indictment) gaining access to Clinton's emails, and President Trump's public call is [a brazen smoking gun considering that the two events occurred on the same day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hladWr2ggAA)
1.6.2.4.1. Con: "Russia backed hackers" was plain speculation on part of the US government without any real proof.
1.6.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Wikileaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy), on multiple occasions, said that Russia had no part in accessing the Clinton illegal server.
1.6.2.4.1.2. Pro: The news organizations still have to use the word "allegedly" in their articles describing the Russian interference.
1.6.2.4.2. Con: What was said by President Trump was a try to point out how illegal was what Clinton had done and that if Russia had these emails, it would be a favor to the US if Russia handed them over.
1.6.3. Pro: He put more trust in [Vladimir Putin](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwiQtdekwcPpAhWXUs0KHX-GAEoQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-europe-44852812&usg=AOvVaw2jCnpDyyrMfceQCpPOLoyi) and [Kim Jong-un](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjfzZnkwcPpAhUIG80KHfoCCAUQFjAAegQIBRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftrump-sides-with-kim-jong-un-over-ally-2019-8&usg=AOvVaw0I1w8Ma2SzCSnqxYmIV-JM) than in [our own intelligence agencies](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=2ahUKEwiQtdekwcPpAhWXUs0KHX-GAEoQFjABegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fstory%2F2018%2F07%2F16%2Ftrump-russia-putin-summit-722418&usg=AOvVaw0nDWPdzQ3nMBnSKkNX03ly).
1.6.3.1. Pro: President Trump's deference to Putin and Russia indicated that he may have been [financially](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/10/does-trump-owe-russia-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-the-presidents-taxes-may-eventually-give-us-answers/) compromised.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: Putin is a strong personality that pulled a whole nation out of a [huge crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia_\(1991%E2%80%93present\)#Crisis). There is nothing wrong with respecting such a person. This claim suggests that any dealing with Putin or Russia is "evil", and this has become a cliche.
1.6.3.2. Con: US intelligence [failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) multiple times to provide proper evidence, leading to illegal wars.
1.6.3.3. Con: Such a claim suggests that listening to other nations outside the traditional alliance is some sort of crime. Previous presidents \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction)\] \[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya)\] did this and ended up with [multiple wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations#2000%E2%80%932009) today while President Trump didn't start any other war. Unless the point is to start more wars.
1.6.4. Con: In America, people are considered [innocent until proven guilty](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/presumption_of_innocence). In the case of President Trump, he was [not proven guilty](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/24/706318191/trump-white-house-hasnt-seen-or-been-briefed-on-mueller-investigation-report) at the end of his presidency.
1.6.4.1. Con: It is hard to be proven guilty when one directly intervenes into the investigation of his own abuse of power. President Trump stopped and tainted the process - and made this claim of unproven guilt empty and irrelevant in his case.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: President Trump [fired the director of the FBI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mccabe/former-fbi-no-2-mccabe-fired-says-trump-administration-targeted-him-idUSKCN1GT02J) who was responsible for the process of accountability.
1.6.4.2. Con: President Trump has been found guilty on [multiple accounts](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/).
1.6.4.3. Con: A [majority of Congress](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55642101) agreed President Trump was not innocent.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: President Trump was impeached in 2019 after being accused of pressuring Ukraine to find [damaging information on Joe Biden, and his son Hunter](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39945744).
1.6.4.4. Con: Multiple [Republican representatives agreed that President Trump was guilty](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/multiple-republicans-agree-trump-s-guilty-it-doesn-t-matter-n1130511), but choose not to hold him responsible.
1.6.4.5. Con: The term of his presidency is immaterial to Trump's guilt or innocence.
1.6.4.6. Con: If Trump committed a crime he would be guilty forever. The end of his term would make no difference.
1.6.4.7. Con: Trump can be proven guilty at any time.
1.6.4.8. Con: Trump has admitted his guilt. He has yet to be criminally prosecuted.
1.6.5. Con: President Trump [supported the US police](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-national-association-police-organizations-leadership/) because he knew their importance for ordinary people.
1.6.6. Con: He appointed Antifa as a [terrorist organisation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52868295), indicating that he was loyal to the United States and its safety.
1.6.6.1. Con: Being loyal means consistently doing things that are good for the country. Occasional good behavior doesn't prove anything.
1.6.6.2. Con: He attacked the left-leaning Antifa terrorists, but refused to do the same for the right-leaning [white supremacists](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-09-30/la-na-pol-2020-trump-white-supremacy).
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: President Trump never denounced white supremacists. Instead, he told them in September 2020 to ["stand down and stand by."](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/opinion/trump-proud-boys.html)
1.6.6.2.1.1. Con: President Trump condemned all white supremacists including the '[Proud Boys](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-proudboys-idUSKBN26N09B)(“I condemn all white supremacists, I condemn the Proud Boys. I don’t know much about the Proud Boys but I condemn that,” Trump told Fox News in an interview.)' in October 2020.
1.6.6.2.1.1.1. Con: President Trump didn't condemn white supremacists, he commanded them to ["stand back and stand by"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZk6VzSLe4Y).
1.6.6.2.1.1.2. Pro: President Trump stated in October 2020 that he [condemned all white supremacists](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54381500).
1.6.6.2.1.2. Pro: After President Trump's comment, "the far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group with a history of street violence against left-wing opponents", [Proud Boys](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54359993), posted the logo "Stand Back, Stand By" on their social media account.
1.6.6.2.2. Con: President Trump [denounced racism](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-40929627) in Charlottesville in 2017 by saying that "the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists were 'repugnant' to everything Americans held dear."
1.6.6.3. Pro: President Trump designated Antifa as a terrorist organization because it had [instigated violence and was connected with domestic terrorism](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-minneapolis-police-trump-antifa-idUKKBN2370LP).
1.6.6.3.1. Con: Antifa does not fit the [definition](https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/what-antifa-is-what-it-isnt-and-why-it-matters/) of a terrorist organization.
1.6.6.3.2. Pro: [Federal law enforcement](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/antifa-dangerous-and-its-time-the-feds-step) has an obligation to stop extremist organizations that participate in violent attacks.
1.6.6.3.3. Con: Media outlets and personalities defined them as such, however they were not a self identified group.
1.6.6.4. Con: America is not a fascist country, and Trump was not acting in accordance with its values.
1.6.6.5. Pro: America is a fascist country, and Trump was withholding its values.
1.6.6.6. Con: Antifa, as it is known in popular vernacular, is conflated with the practice of anarchists utilizing "black bloc" tactics, not an actual defined group.
1.6.7. Pro: The refusal of a president to commit to a peaceful transition of power disgraces the office.
1.6.7.1. Pro: On the night of the elections, President Trump threatened to go to the Supreme Court to [stop](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-election-b1672456.html) the counting of the vote.
1.6.8. Pro: President Trump repeatedly [attacked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/two-easy-wins-now-in-doubt-trump-renews-attack-on-sessions-citing-indictments-of-two-gop-congressmen-ahead-of-midterms/2018/09/03/e6f1356a-afac-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.95f86dc5f38d)(President Trump attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department on Monday in connection with the indictments of two GOP congressmen on corruption charges, saying they could hurt the Republican Party in the midterm elections.\n\n“Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,” he said on Twitter. “Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time.”) the Department of Justice, seeming to prefer defending political allies over allowing a department headed by his own Attorney General to follow its course.
1.6.8.1. Pro: President Trump engaging with the legal process in a [questionable way](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/404828-giuliani-trumps-legal-team-may-block-mueller-from-releasing-final)(President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani is claiming that the president’s legal team may invoke executive privilege to stop special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on the Russia investigation from being released to the public. \n\nGiuliani told The New Yorker that it’s likely the Trump administration would object to the memo being made public information. \n\n\[...\] “I’m sure we will,” he said, before adding that Trump would make the final call on a decision like that. \n\nGiuliani made the comments in reference to the impending report that Mueller will file to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at the conclusion of his investigation into Russian election interference.) consisted of his repeated questioning of the Special Counsel investigation despite the fact there was no concrete evidence incriminating him personally.
1.6.8.1.1. Con: The President pointing out [conflicts of interest](https://latesttimenews.net/politics/trump-criticizes-investigators-citing-unrevealed-conflicts-of-interest/) in the Special Counsel's investigation was completely reasonable.
1.6.8.2. Con: As the party leader, it was his job to support and endorse members of the Republican Party.
1.6.8.3. Con: The [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/) is part of the [Executive Branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice), so it is right and proper for the President to ensure it is following the right course, and to criticise it when it fails to live up to his standards.
1.6.8.3.1. Pro: Article II of the Constitution vests “the executive Power” in the person of the President, therefore [President Trump had “executive” federal function](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/trumps-doj-unitary-executive/607141/).
1.6.8.3.2. Con: The DOJ works for the US Government, not the President, and follows the standard of the law as they state in their [mission statement](https://www.justice.gov/about)(To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.).
1.6.8.3.2.1. Con: The Constitution gives the president authority “[to tell the Justice Department who to investigate and prosecute](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/12/an-interview-with-alan-dershowitz-on-trump-and-the-mueller-investigation.html)(The president’s authority to fire an executive branch official—such as James Comey—is unlimited, even if the official is investigating the president’s friends or allies.)".
1.6.8.3.2.2. Pro: It should not be about "Trump's" standards, but of those that are best for the betterment and running of the United States of America.
1.6.8.3.2.2.1. Con: As the elected President, it should absolutely be about Trump's standards. Anything else would be a direct assault on the Constitution.
1.6.8.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The Constitution provides [checks and balances](https://www.parlament.gv.at/ENGL/PERK/PARL/POL/ParluGewaltenteilung/index.shtml) for the smooth running of the Republic, not to empower a single individual as a supreme dictator. The Constitution's purpose along with the [Declaration of Independence](https://www.constitutionfacts.com/us-declaration-of-independence/fascinating-facts/) was to get away from exactly that.
1.6.8.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: The Constitution concentrates [executive authority on the elected President](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/irony-immense-presidential-power/603115/).
1.6.8.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The support of the people, and their agreement of his standards is also important, otherwise the president can be [impeached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_impeachment), which is also considered valid under the Constitution.
1.6.8.3.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: The powers of the president of the United States are included in those explicitly granted by [Article II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution) of the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution).
1.6.8.4. Con: Jeff Sessions was a political ally of President Trump, and indeed he was one of the first senators to [endorse candidate Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/sen-jeff-sessions-endorses-trump-219939). Therefore it does not appear that President Trump was criticising Sessions because he was not an ally, but rather because he didn't approve of his job performance.
1.6.8.4.1. Con: President Trump's criticisms of Sessions only began when Sessions refused to [shield](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/5/17429068/trump-sessions-tweet-russia-recusal-mueller) and [protect](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/30/donald-trump-expresses-regret-picking-jeff-sessions-attorney/) him from [FBI investigation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-trump-pressed-sessions-to-reverse-decision-to-recuse-himself-from/). They [intensified](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/us/politics/trump-sessions-tweet-russia.html) when [Sessions](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/30/how-trumps-view-sessions-has-changed-over-time.html) [recused](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-sessions-russia.html) [himself](https://www.axios.com/trump-tweets-jeff-sessions-mueller-investigation-recusal-7452ef1b-2ae7-472c-800a-bfd0ff4f1fc6.html) and [refused](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jeff-sessions-mueller-investigation-russia-attorney-general-us-president-a8504911.html) to [end](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tweets-russia-investigation-sessions-1.4769769) the [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/jeff-sessions-trump-justice-department-corruption-statement) [Election](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/25/trump-renews-criticism-of-sessions-over-mueller-investigation.html) [Tampering](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia.html) [Investigation](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/donald-trump-asked-jeff-sessions-to-un-recuse-himself-from-the-russia-investigation-report-says-9235544). This would indicate that his [criticisms](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sessions/trump-renews-criticism-of-sessions-over-mueller-investigation-idUSKCN1LA0GE) were based on his [perception](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions/index.html) that [Sessions](https://newrepublic.com/article/143997/donald-trump-loyal) was [not](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-hits-trump-criticism-180823213611611.html) [personally](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/24/trump-taunts-attorney-general-jeff-sessions.html) [loyal](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-attorney-general/index.html) [directly](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-russia-investigation-jeff-sessions-robert-mueller-stop-us-election-meddling-a8472956.html) to [him](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-sessions-hired-him-because-loyalty-supporter-2018-8).
1.6.8.4.1.1. Con: Sessions should have told President Trump he was going to recuse himself from anything to do with the Trump campaign. It would not have been unreasonable for Trump to select a different Attorney General who wasn't conflicted.
1.6.8.5. Con: President Trump's "attacks" on government agencies served to bring more transparency into what roles they actually played in a government.
1.6.8.6. Pro: President Trump [pardoned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/court-hears-arguments-in-sheriff-joe-arpaios-bid-to-erase-conviction-pardoned-by-trump/)(An appeals court in San Francisco will hear arguments Wednesday in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio's bid to erase his contempt of court conviction from his record after he was pardoned by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe former six-term sheriff of metro Phoenix had appealed a lower-court ruling that refused to expunge his conviction for disobeying a 2011 court order barring his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.) Joe Arpaio for contempt of court, disrespecting the rule of law.
1.6.8.7. Pro: President Trump wanted [immunity for himself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/justice-department-lends-its-firepower-to-defend-trump-in-investigations-into-his-private-finances/2019/10/03/e05c65f4-e542-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html) and his allies while he continued to ask the Justice Department to illegally prosecute Democrats.
1.6.8.7.1. Pro: President Trump encouraged his supporters to press for the arrest of Hillary Clinton by inciting chants of "[lock her up](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-justice-department/index.html)("Lock her up!" the crowd at President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday night chanted. "You should lock her up, I'll tell you," Trump agreed.\nThe "her" is Hillary Clinton. The crime for which the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee should allegedly be imprisoned isn't clear. But the chant has become a regular part of the circus-like atmosphere at Trump rallies, a sort of calling card for the movement.)" at his rallies.
1.6.9. Pro: President Trump has been impeached twice.
1.6.9.1. Pro: In 2019, President Trump was [impeached](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/trump-impeachment-house-vote-nancy-pelosi-latest)(Trump becomes third American president to be impeached as two articles approved, mostly along party lines), being only the third president in history to face charges.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: Party-line [impeachment](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-impeachment-vote-count-house-results/) and [acquittal](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/trump-impeachment-vote-count-senate-results/) is not a good way to measure a president's success.
1.6.9.1.1.1. Con: [Republican Mitt Romney](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/06/trump-impeachment-mitt-romney-braces-abuse-vote-convict/2859115001/), the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S. senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.
