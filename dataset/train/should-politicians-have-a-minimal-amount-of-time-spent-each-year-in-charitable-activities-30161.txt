Discussion Name: Should politicians have a minimal amount of time spent each year in charitable activities?

1. Politicians should spend a minimal amount of hours each year in charitable activities.
1.1. Pro: Politicians getting more involved in charitable activities will bring more spotlight to these activities.
1.1.1. Pro: Politicians run [enormous campaigns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/campaign-finance/) where they highlight all the work they do. This publicity will also bring light to the charity work that politicians are involved in.
1.1.2. Pro: Politicians have a huge voter base. If people see politicians taking part in charitable activities, they are likely to do the same.
1.1.2.1. Con: All of their voter base is not heavily involved in the their lives. Therefore, they are unlikely to know this about politicians.
1.1.2.2. Pro: [Politicians have large social media following](https://www.redherring.com/social/top-politicians-social-media/). Politicians are likely to post their charitable activities on social media which will be visible to millions of people.
1.1.2.3. Con: People see through politicians motivations for taking part in charitable activities. They are not motivated by guideline desire to support the charity but rather the chance to further their own PR and cause. This will not inspire people to replicatite the charitable support.
1.1.3. Con: It starts being a routine then it can stop being an effective way to make people support the cause.
1.1.3.1. Con: If people are forced to do something, they are likely to dislike doing it. Therefore, if politicians no longer run for office, they are unlikely to give charity.
1.1.4. Con: The spotlight generated by a politicians involvement may not always be positive. May bring negative association to the charity and damage overall perception the wider public hold of the charity.
1.2. Con: Politicians should be able to fully devote their time and energy to their office. With compulsory hours for charitable activities, they will have to face problems like fatigue and exhaustion which may make them less productive during their office hours.
1.2.1. Con: Politicians are flexible with restrictions, laws and regulations. Metaphorically, it is an opportunity to feed 3 birds with one portion \( politician, charity and society\). It will bring them closer to the nature action-reaction law.
1.2.2. Pro: It would be far more efficient to have politicians donate a part of their earnings instead.
1.2.2.1. Con: This will not draw attention to charitable causes in the same way that the regular presence of a politican who openly endorses a charity would.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Politicians spending money is more beneficial than doing charity hours.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: There's no reason to assume that is always the case. Spending time with volunteering could encourage more people to join in, so it will rail up more people to take action for the cause.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Any person has the capacity to put in hours of charity work. However, few people have large sums of money which they can donate to charity.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Politicians can lead by example and inspire more people to work. This helps bring the community closer.
1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Politicians can lead by example with monetary donations. More people are likely to donate if politicians do it.
1.2.2.3. Con: This will not help create a strong bound between politicians and their communities.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Donating money does not develop a close and personal relationship with the community.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Many politicians donate money as charity. If they are required to do charity hours, they are unlikely to donate money since hey would think their responsibility is fulfilled.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Politicians try to maintain a positive image compete against each other on the basis of that. Therefore, they have an incentive to out-do each other and give more to charity.
1.2.3. Con: These commitments to charitable work do not have to be regular or time-intensive. The minimal threshold can be set at a manageable amount for all politicians.
1.2.4. Pro: Exhaustion and fatigue will be even worse for older politicians who already go through these problems.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Following the General Election of 2017, the average age of a Member of Parliament \(MP\) in the UK is already high at [50 years old](https://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/members-faq-page2/#jump-link-10). Thus, politicians may be particularly susceptible to fatigue.
1.2.5. Con: In some contries politicians have more free time than a normal person with a normal job so if they have to complete the requesterd extra time and still be working less then the average worker.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Romania [politicians](http://business-review.eu/featured/romanian-mps-have-worked-in-parliament-less-hours-in-five-months-than-a-regular-employee-in-one-month-67426) doesn't work as much as an regular worker.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: In 5 months a Romanian [politician](http://business-review.eu/featured/romanian-mps-have-worked-in-parliament-less-hours-in-five-months-than-a-regular-employee-in-one-month-67426) works as many hours as one regular worker.
1.2.6. Con: Being able to create a balance is a basic concept that they should be have mastered before representing someone else.
1.3. Con: They stood to be elected as politicians and not as charity workers.
1.3.1. Pro: Politicians can use their charity work as a publicity tactic to cover up their failures as politicians.
1.3.1.1. Con: Politicians currently use charity work to cover up their failures. By making it a duty, it will no longer be a way for politicians to make themselves seem like they are inherently charitable.
1.3.1.2. Con: Even if politicians use charity work as a publicity tactic, there is still value in the charity work being done.
1.3.2. Pro: Ultimately, if politicians are mandated to spend working time engaging in charitable activties, they will be getting paid for this. This undermines their role as politicians who are paid a salary to carry out political duties.
1.3.3. Con: Charity work is not in tension with carrying out the role of politician because charity work tends to be linked with social and economic issues. These are [issues that are also political](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/11298/concepts/the-relationship-between-economics-and-politics/).
1.3.4. Con: Politicians are supposed to look out for the good of their populous and as a result they should be expected to be altruistic.
1.3.4.1. Con: When charity work is part of the job requirement for politicians, it ceases to be an altruistic act.
1.4. Con: Politicians should not support charitable giving.
1.4.1. Pro: Charities tend to focus on addressing ['symptoms' rather than addressing the causes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/charity/against_1.shtml) of widespread problems.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Assuming that charitable activties are sufficient solutions to problems diverts attention away from the need to address causal factors.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Wealthy people who create charities, [divert attention](https://www.varsity.co.uk/opinion/18451) from the core problem of large multi-billion dollar companies avoiding tax and thus being able to accumulate vast amounts of wealth in the first instance.
1.4.1.2. Con: Failing to address the symptoms would in effect be ignoring the \(often life-threatening\) consequences facing people today for an uncertain hypothetical future without any of these problems.
1.4.1.3. Con: Charity is the best solution workable solution available to reduce the impacts of socio-economic inequality today, even if the solution does not address the causes of this inequality.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: If we identify the root cause of extreme socio-economic inequality as 'capitalism', it would demand that we have a more robust system of politico-economic organisation to replace capitalism with. We do not, charity mitigates the effects of this [necessary evil](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/capitalism-kapil-sibal-india-today-conclave-vince-cable-96279-2012-03-18).
1.4.2. Pro: Charity work discourages the state from taking responsibility for social and economic welfare.
1.4.3. Pro: The encouragement of charity, via tax incentives, undermine social inequalities.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Tax incentives intended to encourage charity [reduces the revenue that the state would otherwise have](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/charity/against_1.shtml) \(via tax revenue\) avaialble to address social inequalities.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: There is no guarantee that the state would spend any additional money generated via tax on resolving social inequalities. There is a chance the state may spend the money on increasing the salaries of public officials or in funding a number of other governmental expenses.
1.5. Con: They can have fake documentation that say they did it but in actual fact didn't.
1.5.1. Pro: Politicians are [not trustworthy](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-least-trustworthy-jobs-a7454641.html), thus it is likely that their behaviour will be disingenuous.
1.5.2. Con: Politicians are unlikely to produce fake documentation since, if they get caught, they could be fined or have to face jail time.
1.5.3. Con: Checks and balances can be put into place to ensure that politicians cannot provide fake documentation.
1.5.4. Pro: Politicians can work at fake [non-governmental organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) they have set up or bribe officials working in non-governmental organizations to give them the papers proving they have done charitable work when they haven't.
1.6. Con: By making this as a law, you're effectively reducing the perceived value of voluntary work.
1.6.1. Pro: It should not be necessary to do charity to get a position in any place.
1.6.2. Con: By having a minimum bar of charity work, you're essentially creating a minimum amount of respect that politicians have show to the community, especially to people with less fortune in life.
1.7. Pro: It increases the overall charity work being done.
1.7.1. Con: Compared to the number of charities and volume of charitable work, the direct contribution of the relatively small number of politicians within the population is unlikely to be significant.
1.7.2. Pro: If more people do charity work, more vulnerable groups are likely to be benefited from it.
1.7.2.1. Con: If people with strict views \(like kkk members\) do charities works maybe they'll try to enforce there views on to others.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: It is difficult to determine whether or not people with 'strict views' necessarily have a negative impact.
1.7.3. Con: Quality maybe be an issue because of low qualifications that they might have to fulfill their role.
1.8. Con: Charity shouldn't be imposed.
1.8.1. Pro: Charity, by definition, is the [voluntary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity) act of giving to those in need.
1.8.1.1. Pro: People should be able to give charity out of the goodness of their hearts.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Some politicians do not give charity out of the goodness of their heart. Therefore, in order to make them, it is important to make it compulsory.
1.9. Con: Creates a need to monitor all the activities of politicians.
1.9.1. Con: It should not be difficult to monitor a politicians charity work. All this requires is for them to clock in and out where ever they are volunteering.
1.9.2. Pro: Adding a new bureaucratic layer should be avoided. Adding new needs creates new layers of bureaucracy.
1.9.3. Pro: Monitoring the activities is likely to be expensive.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Adding more layers of bureaucracy can be [costly](https://www.cato.org/blog/mirror-mirror-wall-which-country-has-most-expensive-bureaucrats-all) and an unnecessary waste of taxpayer money.
1.9.4. Con: The new system will show politicians' preferred charitable activities. People with similar charitable interests are likely to relate to them more.
1.9.5. Pro: Their [right to privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy) is likely to be violated.
1.9.5.1. Pro: When the personal lives of politicians are constantly monitored, it can also end up compromising the privacy of the politicians' families.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: Politicians' families tacitly consent to having their privacy breached.
1.9.5.1.1.1. Pro: Families benefit off the family member's political career.
1.9.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Families enjoy perks and high [salaries](https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/pay-mps/) of their family members if they get elected into office.
1.9.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Since politicians are likely to be famous and have dedicated followers, their family is likely to gain popularity as well.
1.9.5.2. Con: The right to privacy is not absolute and is sacrificed in standing for public office.
1.9.6. Con: Politicians' lives are often under the spotlight and scrutinized anyways. This way, at least the less fortunate will benefit as a result.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Since 1976, [most Democratic and Republican presidential](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/charitable-judgment-candidate-philanthropy/497738/) nominees have released their income-tax returns, allowing the press to poke around in them.
1.10. Pro: Making charity hours compulsory can help politicians better understand the interests of the people they want to represent.
1.10.1. Pro: Spending more time with people allows politicians to have better a sense of their needs and grievances.
1.10.1.1. Pro: People will be able to access politicians more easily and voice their grievances.
1.10.1.2. Pro: This in turn can help them make better policies and pass legislature that adheres to the actual needs of the people.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: Elected officials are already enacting policies that are reflective of the opinions held by people in their districts.
1.10.1.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/upshot/politicians-mostly-follow-voters.html) found the way that residents were taxed in districts was in line with the voters' ideologies.
1.10.1.2.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://politicalsciencenow.com/policy-preferences-and-policy-change/) found that changes in economic and social issues are determined by how liberal the public is.
1.10.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The study found that the greater the share of liberal voters in a city, the [greater](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/upshot/politicians-mostly-follow-voters.html) the benefits offered through the federal welfare program Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \(TANF\).
1.10.1.3. Pro: Time spent between members of the community and politicians is a way to develop the community bonds.
1.10.1.3.1. Pro: Politicians should be the voice of the people who voted for them. By building this bridge, they can better represent voters.
1.10.2. Pro: Politicians receive votes from people on the basis that they will represent their interests. Therefore, they have a duty to make sure they are aware of the people's interests.
1.10.3. Pro: A [majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/29/many-across-the-globe-are-dissatisfied-with-how-democracy-is-working/pg_2019-04-29_global-views-of-democracy_0-04/) of people believe that elected politicians do not care about what people want. Such an act could correct this perception.
1.10.4. Con: Politicians do not need to directly interact with people to understand their interests. Instead, they can rely on polls, surveys, and other data gathering techniques to find out what the people want.
1.10.4.1. Con: A [study](https://osf.io/c2sp6/) found that politicians intentionally misperceive their constituents' opinions in order to resist responding to these changes.
1.10.5. Pro: A [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/politicians-voters.html) found that the majority of legislators were not interested in learning about the opinions of their constituents. This is the best way to ensure that politicians are exposed to these opinions regardless.
1.10.6. Con: If a politician doesn't understand their constituents, the greater question is how they were elected/keep getting elected to begin with.
1.10.7. Con: The portion of a constituency who benefit from charity may be minimal, doing charitable work therefore is unlikely to provide greater understanding of a politicians broader electorate.
1.11. Pro: It's a way to weed out selfish people out of representing others.
1.11.1. Pro: The remaining politicians will fundamentally be decent role models for people.
1.11.2. Con: Politicians might only choose to promote charities that they feel a personal affiliation for. Such an action would still be self-motivated.
1.11.3. Pro: This will act as a disincentive for politicians who are dishonest and uninterested in working for the welfare of the people.
1.11.3.1. Con: Dishonest people are still likely to run for office.
1.11.3.1.1. Pro: A few hours of charity is a small price of pay for enormous amounts of money politicians can embezzle.
1.11.3.1.2. Con: By creating a cost even if it is small it creates a reflection time on it thus people are less likely to run for office then with no cost involved.
1.12. Pro: Compelling politicians to engage with charitable events helps bring them closer to the people.
1.12.1. Pro: When people get involved with charitable work, they would get closer to the most unfortunate in society and understand their conditions better.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Understanding the deplorable conditions some people in their neighborhoods have to live in will encourage these politicians to have better policies that protect the most underprivileged.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: Many politicians are [corrupt](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa6f/3b2af0385b6d4bece84c4733c922b4ef5199.pdf). Even though they will complete their charity hours, they will care about accumulating wealth as opposed to caring about the welfare of the poor.
1.12.1.1.1.1. Con: These selfish politicians will likely waste time accumulating wealth in either scenario. At least now they would be forced to spend a few hours doing charity.
1.12.1.1.1.2. Con: Most humans change over time so by doing the hours there is a slight chance that they will become more community oriented or maybe just give up an politicians.
