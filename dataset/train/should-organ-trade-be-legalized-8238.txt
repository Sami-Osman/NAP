Discussion Name: Should Organ Trade Be Legalized?

1. Organ trade should be legalized.
1.1. Pro: Any trade implies that both parties agree on something which benefits them both.
1.1.1. Con: That's assuming that both parties are well informed on the consequences of the given trade, which in this case they tend not to be.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Donors in the black market in India, for instance, are often [tricked or misinformed](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/living-cadavers-how-the-poor-are-tricked-into-selling-their-organs/254570/) about the consequences that donating their organs could have on their lives.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Legalisation would ensure that the proper information was distributed to donors.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Education about the consequences can be provided without first legalizing the trade. It can dramatically improve the current situation with the black market and is also a requirement before legalizing is even considered.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The information provided while trade is illegal will be centered about the risks of organ trade and discouraging it, not helping people that wish to donate safely.
1.1.2. Pro: People in economic need that can sell their organs normally do it to support their loved ones. There is virtue in sacrificing yourself for others.
1.1.2.1. Con: This is a virtue if you sacrifice yourself for something that you think is right. Giving part of you to someone else only for money is abuse of someone who is in a difficult situation.
1.1.3. Con: It assumes both parties are willing participants.
1.2. Con: Legalizing organ trade would put unsuspecting people in danger.
1.2.1. Con: Non-consentual organ harvesting would actually decrease if organ sales were legalized. This is because organ sales would be regulated to ensure transplanted organs come from legitimate sources and organ recipients would no longer have to obtain organs from a black market with no such regulatory oversight.
1.2.2. Pro: Legalizing organ trade may increase the number of criminally acquired organs, because it is a highly lucrative business and it is almost impossible to detect coersion-free consensus from the donors.
1.2.3. Pro: A person will sell organs only if very poor or in a desperate need for money. So his will to sell organs would not be free, but instead forced by condition. So it would not be a trade but a a blackmail.
1.2.3.1. Con: There is no supporting argument or evidence for why only poor people would be willing to sell organs at the market rate, and thus the above point should be disregarded by the reader.
1.2.4. Con: The illegal trade of organs carries far greater dangers than under a legalised system.
1.2.4.1. Con: Sellers who obtain organs illegally can access a legal market to sell them in, making it easier to conduct highly profitable illegal organ harvesting with lesser chances of being caught.
1.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Unsuspecting people are placed in financial danger when the organ trades are illegal \(people [illegally cannot make an income off donations but will still be taxed as so](http://www.weareeggdonors.com/blog/2015/11/13/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-donated-my-eggs), making them lose money in the end\)
1.2.4.4. Pro: The illegal status allows for greed through various schemes \(such as the [kidney trade](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/living-cadavers-how-the-poor-are-tricked-into-selling-their-organs/254570/)\). Greedy people take the organs without letting donors know the legalities of it.
1.2.4.5. Pro: The black market is strife with [organised crime syndicates and brokers](http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/what-you-need-to-know-about-human-organ-trafficking) that exploit unknowing victims.
1.2.5. Pro: Giving economic value to people's bodyparts is the same as making vulnerable people targets for thieves and murderers.
1.2.5.1. Pro: There are a limited number of organs in the human body that can be removed for sale without killing the donor.
1.2.5.2. Con: The term 'legalised' is being conflated with 'unregulated'. Nobody is arguing that organs of unknown origins should be able to be bought and sold legally.
1.2.5.3. Con: Organs already have economic value but it's expressed in the black market.
1.3. Pro: People should have the freedom to do what they want with their bodies, including selling parts of it.
1.3.1. Pro: If we accept that people have the right to perforate their bodies, tattoo them or sell use of a body then it follows that we accept people have the right to do whatever they want with it.
1.3.1.1. Con: Plastic surgery and tattoos are cosmetic and primarily benefit and impact the customer themselves. By contrast, an organ donor could be exposed to massive economic, social, and moral pressure to sacrifice a part of themselves for no intrinsic benefit. Thus, they are not analogous.
1.3.1.2. Con: By contrast to organ donation, sex work is reversible insofar as they can stop. An organ donor cannot get their organs back.
1.3.2. Con: That would bring more problems rather than solve them. For instance, a pregnant women could say that a fetus is her property, and therefore she could do anything she wants with it.
1.3.3. Con: People will not always make the right choices about their bodies. It is wrong to influence such a decision by luring them with money.
1.3.4. Con: There is a precedent of the government banning practices involving the sale of individuals' bodies when there is a risk that it could put people in harm's way.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Slavery and working below minimal wage is illegal in many countries to prevent economically challenged people to be coerced or tricked into slavery.
1.3.4.2. Pro: [Prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_law#General) is illegal in many countries to protect people in economic desperation from victimisation.
1.4. Pro: Legalising organ trade could save lives.
1.4.1. Con: In the US many kidneys are [wasted](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2017/12/07/us-wasting-kidneys/) and could instead be put to good use.
1.4.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that the problem leading to these kidneys disposals will be rectified easily.
1.4.1.2. Con: Even if the US didn't waste any kidneys, that's 5000 more kidneys for the 100000 patients waiting for one just in the US, which is only [5% of the total demand](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2017/12/07/us-wasting-kidneys/#.WmF5IK7ia00).
1.4.2. Pro: [Iran](http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/1/6/1136.full) made it legal to sell one's kidney in 1988 and they are now one of the only nations that is not suffering from an organ shortage.
1.4.3. Pro: Market economics would allow for greater efficiency in matching suitable donors to recipients in need than under the current donation-based system.
1.4.4. Pro: There's an overwhelming [shortage](https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/06/opt-solution-organ-shortage/) of viable organs that could be alleviated by offering economic incentives.
1.4.5. Con: Saving the most lives may not maximise happiness, quality of life, etc. for humanity. Alternatively recognising mortality, being supported through it, having a strong community, etc. may lead to greater happiness, mental health, wealth, etc.
1.4.6. Con: There may be fewer voluntary free donors if they could get paid instead.
1.4.6.1. Con: People could donate money to enable poorer people to afford the organ they are in need of. Given people are more likely to donate money to strangers than organs, this will increase the amount of people able to receive a life-saving transplant.
1.4.6.2. Con: People would still donate their organs to families or close friends in need, which is what they already do.
1.4.7. Pro: On average, [20 people](https://unos.org/data/) die each day waiting for an organ to become available.
1.4.8. Con: This policy would make the development of artificial organs less likely, thereby increasing the chances of organ shortages in the future.
1.4.8.1. Pro: We cannot make sure that the body accepts the organ of another person, which is why we should put more money in making artificial organs, cheap and accessible.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Only in times of scarcity will innovation be pushed towards creating artificial organs, since [necessity is the mother of invention](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention).
1.4.8.3. Pro: People will buy what is readily available \(human organs\) and not think about artificial ones.
1.5. Pro: Making organ trading legal would allow for protective regulation, which is impossible in a black market.
1.5.1. Pro: Those who participate in organ trade should be protected to ensure each party gets what they bargain for.
1.5.2. Pro: Being able to take organ traders and middle-men to court in the case of malpractice offers a protection to organ donors.
1.5.3. Pro: [The WHO](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/27/kidney-trade-illegal-operations-who) estimates that 10,000 kidneys are traded on the black market annually. Prohibition is clearly not working, arguably opening up to further abuse than under a policy of legalisation.
1.5.3.1. Con: The fact that something becomes 'legal', actually doesn't stop the black markets. For example, cigars and [alcohol](https://www.havocscope.com/tag/alcohol-smuggling/) are legal in most countries and the black markets doesn't seem to come to an end.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Some bootleggers trade on the black markets to [avoid tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackmarket.asp) and regulations imposed by the government in the legal markets.
1.5.4. Con: There are things that couldn't be regulated, like the influx of new poor people wanting to sell their organs.
1.5.4.1. Con: Although it wouldn't be possible just to forbid it, measurements like [mandatory waiting periods](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.21.3.3) for donors would reduce the risks of rushed decisions.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.5.6. Con: In countries where corruption is high, regulation would be less likely to be applied effectively.
1.5.6.1. Con: Less effective regulation is better than no regulation.
1.5.6.2. Pro: A good example is [India](https://www.thenational.ae/world/india-s-dire-need-for-organs-still-fuels-a-deadly-trade-1.195654), which has high rates of both organ tourism, corruption in their institutions, and "willing" donors.
1.6. Con: Such a policy would lead to further social inequality, whereby rich people can save their lives and the poor cannot.
1.6.1. Pro: The current system does not provide enough organs for everyone who needs them, so the only options for people in need of organs are the black market or international travel, both of which are prohibitively expensive to lower income earners.
1.6.2. Pro: Poor people would be more often obliged to offer organs due to economic difficulties.
1.6.2.1. Con: Nobody in this situation is "obliged" to do anything.
1.6.3. Pro: Anybody with enough money would avoid selling an organ, given the potentially life-threatening [consequences](https://www.americantransplantfoundation.org/about-transplant/living-donation/about-living-donation/) that type of operation could have.
1.6.4. Con: Making organ trade legal would give poor people a way of making money.
1.6.4.1. Con: The organ trade industry that would emerge would be profiting from others' economic desperation, which is unethical.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: That could be said of any market that deals with medical necessities, like insulin or rare drugs
1.6.4.2. Con: This may be one of the least safe ways of making money. It's a major surgery and a one-off method, and produces live-long consequences.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: Most studies report death rates for donor nephrectomy in the range of [1 or 2 per 10,000](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/nephrectomy) donor surgeries, which is comparable with motor vehicle deaths \([around1.1 per 10,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year)\)
1.6.4.2.2. Con: That's a factor for the donor to consider but it shouldn't be up to others to decide what level of risk is acceptable.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Organ trade is no different to other ways in which the poor make money; in practice, [miners](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/pneumoconiosis)(Pneumoconiosis is one of a group of interstitial lung disease caused by breathing in certain kinds of dust particles that damage your lungs. Because you are likely to encounter these dusts only in the workplace, pneumoconiosis is called an occupational lung disease \[...\] One of the most common forms is black lung disease, also known as miner's lung.) trade in their lung health to earn a living.
1.6.5. Con: People should be allowed to try and save their lives if they have the economic means to do so.
1.6.5.1. Con: They should also be allowed to try and save their lives if they don‘t have the economic means.
1.6.6. Con: Laws should not be designed around forced equality. Laws should be focused on maximizing individual freedom and managing disputes between parties in a fair and non-violent manner.
1.6.6.1. Con: Where market conditions are such that there is urgent demand and unreliable supply, maximizing one person's freedom to access a life-saving organ transplant indirectly impacts another's prospects of survival and, consequently, their freedom.
1.6.7. Con: Governmental institutions could offer social programs or subsidies for people who need them.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Some countries already have the infrastructure to implement this, such as the UK which has a [national health service \(NHS\)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Health-Service).
1.6.7.2. Con: It would make more sense that we all become organ donors rather than paying for this social programs. That would make the transactions more direct and more efficient.
1.6.7.2.1. Con: Particularly in large countries, arranging organ transplants is a complicated and high stakes operation best run by an overarching governmental body which has information on who is most in need, blood types, and so on.
1.6.8. Con: Allowing people to sell organs would flood the market with many additional organs. This would help rich and poor alike.
1.6.9. Pro: Donors are likely to be impoverished and in difficult situations, while wealthy individuals are the ones that can afford to buy organs in the first place, giving these transactions and inherent imbalance of power.
1.6.10. Pro: Given the high stakes involved in organ purchases, elasticity of demand would be low meaning suppliers could get away with charging extortionate prices that poor people would struggle to afford.
1.7. Con: It is unethical to put a price on a human life.
1.7.1. Con: Attaching measurable value to human lives [is part of an ethical duty](http://lesswrong.com/lw/n3/circular_altruism/) to do as much good as possible.
1.7.2. Con: You are just putting a value on the use of an organ, not a human life.
1.7.3. Con: Everything a person is or can produce is already commoditized under capitalism, meaning the price is already implicitly there, an open market organ trade would just be more granular in defining those prices.
1.7.3.1. Con: Putting a life on an entire human and the work they can produce is not the same as putting a price on their constituent parts. The latter is much more commodifying.
1.7.4. Pro: Human bodies are a gift from God and we hold them in trust. You cannot justly sell what belongs to someone else.
1.7.4.1. Con: There is no logical argument for God. If there was, one person's beliefs shouldn't decide another's rights.
1.7.4.2. Con: You are not selling the organs, but rather just leasing them to someone else, for the limited period of their life.
1.7.4.3. Con: God is not a legal admitted being, therefore no one can make recognized contracts with it.
