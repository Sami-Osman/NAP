Discussion Name: Should the death penalty be abolished?

1. Death penalty should be abolished.
1.1. Con: The death sentence provides an effective deterrent in terms of stopping other people from committing the same crime.
1.1.1. Con: Life sentences are a sufficient deterrent of crime such that the death penalty is rendered unnecessary.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Prisons in Scandinavian countries are not harsh and have some of the lowest [recidivism rates](https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/prison-life-in-scandinavia/) in the world.
1.1.2. Con: The "[brutalization hypothesis](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/JLpaper.pdf)" suggests that capital punishment may actually encourage homicide by legitimizing the killing of other individuals \(p. 8\).
1.1.2.1. Pro: Studies from London and New York have shown [an increase](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/JLpaper.pdf) in homicides after highly publicized executions.
1.1.3. Pro: Research by [Isaac Elrich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Ehrlich) in the 1970s [suggested that](https://www.heritage.org/testimony/the-death-penalty-deters-crime-and-saves-lives) the death penalty had a strong deterrent effect.
1.1.3.1. Con: Countries that abstain from the death penalty and instead use life sentences have a lower [homicide rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate).
1.1.3.2. Con: US States with the death penalty consistently yield [higher murder rates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states) than states with no death penalty.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: It is possible that places where there is no death penalty have stronger firearm control initiatives or more robust social services, reducing their rate of murder in place of the death penalty.
1.1.4. Pro: Most people fear death; the death penalty therefore imposes a far higher cost than typical imprisonment.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Prisoners serving life sentences can adjust to their circumstances and find a measure of solace in prison, reducing the efficacy of the deterrent to others.
1.1.4.2. Con: Even with life imprisonment, people live separately from their loved ones. Knowing this is a sufficient deterrent in most cases.
1.1.4.3. Con: Poor [prison conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/27/prisoners-dying-poor-care-services-prisons-mental-health-care-quality-commission-report) act as a disincentive for people to commit crime.
1.1.4.4. Con: The [majority](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/health/mass-murderers-mental-illness.html)(It is true that severe mental illnesses are found more often among mass murderers. About one in five are likely psychotic or delusional, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of 350 mass killers going back more than a century. The figure for the general public is closer to 1 percent.\n\nBut the rest of these murderers do not have any severe, diagnosable disorder. Though he was abusive to his wife, Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub, had no apparent serious mental illness. Neither did Stephen Paddock, who mowed down 58 concertgoers from a hotel window in Las Vegas.) of murderers are [mentally unstable](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/12/are-all-murderers-mentally-ill/67295/)(Certainly the evidence, or perhaps just awareness, of how widespread mental illness is among criminals, and especially those incarcerated for violent crimes, seems to be growing. In 1999, the Bureau of Justice Statistics \(BJS\) estimated the percentage of inmates suffering from a significant mental condition at 16 percent. In a comparable report issued in 2006, the BJS revised that number upward to over 50 percent.) so the death penalty is unlikely to be a deterrent for them.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: A sufficiently large group of murderers are not mentally unwell and so can still be deterred by the death penalty.
1.2. Con: It is cheaper for the society to execute people than keep them in jail for life \([p. 3](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050046/costs-per-place-costs-per-prisoner-2020_-2021.pdf)\).
1.2.1. Con: It is immoral to value saving resources at the cost of the life of a human being.
1.2.1.1. Con: The resources used to fund the death penalty could be put to better use, for example, by giving food to the poor.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Human life is intrinsically valuable, even if someone has committed an atrocious act. The death penalty undermines this.
1.2.2. Pro: The death penalty reduces the amount of resources, such as prison space and food, that are dedicated to prisoners.
1.2.2.1. Con: It is [more expensive](https://deathpenalty.org/facts/5-myths-death-penalty/) to seek the death penalty than sentence someone to [life imprisonment](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty).
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Capital trials [automatically](https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/resources/dpappealsprocess) receive an appeal at the state appellate courts, increasing the costs of a trial.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The jury selection process for a capital case is more [complex](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/jury-consultant-2164304) than for a non-capital case. Each juror must be able to consider the evidence and render the death sentence, if warranted.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: [Lethal](https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/virginia-s-lethal-injection-costs-set-to-skyrocket-as-secret/article_cedb7db1-e2a3-596f-9350-63b991a11c26.html) injections are [expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/13/lethal-injection-drug-blocked-by-judge) and impose an undue cost on the justice system.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: In times of budgetary crisis, the expense of lethal injections can impose a [severe](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/arizona-doc-paid-1-5-million-for-execution-drugs-while-facing-a-budget-shortfall)(At a time in which the Arizona Department of Corrections is facing criticism for crumbling infrastructure, substandard medical care, and understaffing, the department has spent $1.5 million to purchase the lethal-injection drug pentobarbital from an undisclosed source. The exorbitant price, experts say, is a function of the questionable use of the drug for non-medical purposes and the secretive nature of the transaction.) financial burden. It is better to forego this in favor of more humane punishments.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: If the death penalty was regularly used, it could be made more efficient and lower in cost.
1.2.2.1.2.3. Con: The cost of an execution could be as low as [$1286.86](https://www.vice.com/en/article/znq399/whats-the-cheapest-way-to-execute-evildoers)(Lethal injection is normally a three-step process: The prisoner must be sedated and then paralyzed, before being shot up with potassium chloride, which stops the heart. In 2009, it cost prisons as little as $168.03 to knock off a wrongdoer thanks to the inexpensive, and now unavailable \(thanks to some soft-hearted judges\), sedative thiopental sodium. The replacement chemical became pentobarbital, which is $861.60 a pop, and raises the price of execution to $1,286.86 per person.); this is [significantly less](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/01/2021-18800/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration-fee-coif)(Based on FY 2019 data, the average annual COIF for a Federal inmate in a Federal facility in FY 2019 was $35,347 \($107.85 per day\). The average annual COIF for a Federal inmate in a Residential Reentry Center for FY 2019 was $39,924 \($109.38 per day\). \(Please note: There were 365 days in FY 2019.\)) than the cost of maintaining a prisoner for even a year.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: The additional costs of the death penalty are contrived. If the same burdens were guaranteed for all cases, then sustaining a criminal in prison for life would cost more.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: If all motions and appeals raised against a death penalty sentence are necessary to provide an adequate defense, the same should be afforded to those facing life in prison. This would make the costs equal.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The average cost per prisoner at HMP Nottingham in 2017/18 was [£35,673](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/how-much-costs-keep-prisoner-2155732).
1.2.2.3. Pro: In the US, the cost of keeping an inmate in jail is [$31,000](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/05/19/how-much-does-it-cost-send-someone-prison/) per year.
1.2.2.4. Con: On average, in the US, a death row inmate costs $1.12 million more than a general population inmate \([p. 46](https://scholarlycommons.susqu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=supr)(In the 32 states in the Union where the death penalty is legal, as well as the federal government, the death penalty has grown to be much more expensive than life imprisonment, whether with or without parole. This greater cost comes from more expensive living conditions, a much\nmore extensive legal process, and increasing resistance to the death penalty from chemical manufacturers overseas. These costs could even become higher, pending the outcome of various lawsuits against various states for their “botched” executions. Each death penalty inmate is approximately $1.12 million \(2015 USD\) more than a general population inmate.)\).
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Death row inmates spend a significant time of their lives on death row, so they are older than the average prison population. That leads to higher health care costs that come from age-related illnesses \([p. 320](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3138/44c9ac34dce4f54cd6c995bbd4fc4606562f.pdf)\).
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Death row inmates are more likely to suffer from serious mental health disorders. More resources have to be spent on them to allay their distress \([p. 192](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/CunninghamDeathRowReview.pdf)\).
1.2.2.4.3. Con: Executions could be hastened to save more money.
1.2.3. Con: Capital punishment does not address the root cause of crime; by continuing the death penalty at the expense of early intervention, society spends more as crime continues to occur.
1.3. Pro: Life cannot be given back so the death penalty carries the risk of ruining innocent people's lives.
1.3.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/) has estimated that many death row inmates were wrongly convicted and could have been exonerated.
1.3.1.1. Con: People who have been wrongly sentenced to death can appeal their convictions.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Given that trials take a long time, many prisoners [die](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/06/12/the-man-who-spent-35-years-in-prison-without-a-trial) before their conviction is overturned.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Many defendants do not have the necessary [financial resources](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/costs) to fight the legal battle to overturn a wrongful conviction.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: [Public defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_defender) can represent defendants who do not have the money to hire a lawyer. This makes it easier to appeal a conviction.
1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Public defenders are [overworked and underfunded](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/poor-rely-public-defenders-too-overworked) because of which they cannot represent defendants very effectively \([p. 13](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/spdp07.pdf)\). This decreases their likelihood of receiving fair representation and makes it more likely that they will be wrongfully convicted.
1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Many dedicated public defenders are competent and concerned public servants who work diligently to ensure their clients receive adequate counsel.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Only [25%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml)(Out of all offenders who are sentenced to death, three quarters of those who are allocated a legal aid lawyer can expect execution, a figure that drops to a quarter if the defendant could afford to pay for a lawyer.) of defendents who can afford to pay for a lawyer receive the death penalty, compared to 75% of those who receive legal aid.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Poor representation was the reason for [68% of reversed convictions](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/00/06/lawStudy.html). Thus, appealing a conviction could help many who have been wrongly sentenced.
1.3.1.2. Con: The institution of state execution cannot direct how it is used. It is possible for the system to be reformed, and given this, the death penalty would then be legitimate.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Wrongful convictions are increasingly less likely as technological advancements, such as DNA testing and modern [criminal justice procedures](https://johnhoward.ca/blog/fewer-wrongful-convictions/), improve criminal science.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The death penalty is often used [disproportionately against](http://www.icomdp.org/arguments-against-the-death-penalty/) the poor, ethnic and racial minorities, and members of other marginalized groups.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: People of colour [have accounted for](https://www.aclu.org/other/race-and-death-penalty) 43% of the executions in the US since 1976, and around 55% of those currently awaiting execution.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Administrators of the death penalty are racially biased, not the punishment. This can be reformed with proper due diligence.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: It takes time to eliminate racial bias, especially if it is long embedded. In the meantime, it is too dangerous to allow racists to wield the death penalty.
1.3.1.4. Pro: All punishments should be reversible, in case they are later found to be based upon flawed criminal convictions.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Researchers estimate that more than [340 U.S. inmates](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/) that could have been exonerated were sentenced to death since 1973.
1.3.1.4.2. Con: There is no need for posthumous pardons or reversible death sentences for cases where the criminal is guilty without doubt. There are many such cases wherein the death penalty is appropriate.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Samuel Little](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/samuel-little-most-prolific-serial-killer-in-us-history-100619) confessed to 93 murders over the course of 35 years, 50 of which have been corroborated.
1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: [James Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Holmes_\(mass_murderer\)) shot and [killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora,_Colorado_shooting) 12 people in a cinema and injured 70 others. The killings were witnessed by 400 people.
1.3.1.4.2.3. Pro: [Dylann Roof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylann_Roof), a self-professed white supremacist and neo-Nazi, murdered nine people during a Bible study. Roof confessed, plead guilty, was convicted and is awaiting execution. He is guilty beyond doubt.
1.3.1.4.2.4. Con: Cases wherein people are guilty beyond doubt are few and far between. It is better to abolish the death penalty to reduce the number of innocent people who are killed, than keep it in service of such rare instances.
1.3.1.4.2.5. Con: In cases where guilt is evident, defendents can still avoid the death penalty on the grounds of [criminal insanity](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/federal-appeals-court-reverses-south-carolina-death-sentence-finding-sentencing-judge-ignored-uncontested-evidence-of-defendants-mental-illness)(The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has overturned a South Carolina death-row prisoner’s death sentence after finding that the sentencing judge in his case had ignored uncontested evidence of the defendant’s mental illness and history of severe childhood abuse and neglect.). Given this, the death penalty offers little utility.
1.3.2. Con: Murderers have already ruined innocent lives and should be prevented from killing again. Their life is worth less than that of the innocents they may harm.
1.3.3. Con: No one should be executed unless they are guilty beyond question. If positive culpatory evidence surfaces, a formerly spared criminal could then be executed.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Killing someone is irreversible, whereas someone in prison can always commit suicide.
1.3.4. Pro: No justice system can be perfect, so there is always the possibility of executing the innocent.
1.4. Pro: The death penalty goes against our most basic human right, the right to life.
1.4.1. Pro: Each person has [human dignity](https://cbhd.org/category/issues/human-dignity) and subjecting them to [cruel and unusual punishment](https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a9dd4.html) is inhumane.
1.4.1.1. Con: It is more humane to kill people than to restrain their liberty for life.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Prisoners in many parts of the world are kept in [miserable](https://list25.com/25-most-brutal-prisons-in-the-world/) [conditions](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/the-world-s-worst-prisons-thailand-russia-and-china-top-our-list).
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Many argue that prisons are too [comfortable](https://www.prisonfellowship.org/2015/09/when-prison-becomes-too-comfortable/) for convicts, and therefore not punitive enough for those who have committed heinous crimes.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Prisons in the United States [struggle](https://www.aclu.org/issues/prisoners-rights#current) to provide humane conditions for the prison population.
1.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Prisons can be [improved](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/justice-and-prison-reform/prison-reform-and-alternatives-to-imprisonment.html)(Central to the arguments to promote prison reforms is a human rights argument - the premise on which many UN standards and norms have been developed. However, this argument is often insufficient to encourage prison reform programmes in countries with scarce human and financial resources. The detrimental impact of imprisonment, not only on individuals but on families and communities, and economic factors also need to be taken into account when considering the need for prison reforms.) to preserve people's liberty, even as they serve life sentences
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Restraining liberty is done to protect the well-being of others. Once someone is restrained, the decision to live or die should be theirs alone.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Even in so-called [humane](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/18/halden-most-humane-prison-in-world)(Halden is one of Norway's highest-security jails, holding rapists, murderers and paedophiles. Since it opened two years ago, at a cost of 1.3bn Norwegian kroner \(£138m\), it has acquired a reputation as the world's most humane prison. It is the flagship of the Norwegian justice system, where the focus is on rehabilitation rather than punishment...\n\nObviously the hotel comparison is a stupid one, since the problem with being in prison, unlike staying in a hotel, is that you cannot leave. Even if the prison compound has more in common with a modern, rural university campus, with young and enthusiastic staff \(who push themselves around the compound on fashionable, silver two-wheel scooters\), the key point about it is that hidden behind the silver birch trees is a thick, tall concrete wall, impossible to scale.) prisons, people are cut off from their support structures and other aspects of meaningful life.
1.4.1.2. Pro: A person sentenced to death has no way to rehabilitate themselves, unlike if they were merely imprisoned.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: It is unfair to sustain criminals who cannot reform while unable to help good people. By implementing the death penalty, more help can be offered to the latter group, increasing society's humanity.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: In prison, criminals can receive [support](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug03/rehab)(Until the mid-1970s, rehabilitation was a key part of U.S. prison policy. Prisoners were encouraged to develop occupational skills and to resolve psychological problems--such as substance abuse or aggression--that might interfere with their reintegration into society. Indeed, many inmates received court sentences that mandated treatment for such problems.) to resolve psychological issues. Such rehabilitation could help them make amends to their victims and others.
1.4.1.3. Con: The death penalty can be adminstered using painless methods, just like [euthanasia](https://www.britannica.com/topic/euthanasia).
1.4.2. Con: Some crimes deserve the death penalty, no other punishment sufficiently acknowledges the pain caused to the victim\(s\) and society.
1.4.2.1. Con: The death penalty [negatively affects](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6539) the families of the victim\(s\) as well as the defendant\(s\).
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: People have family or loved ones who are financially dependent on them. Taking their life deprives a family of the means to sustain themselves.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: If a criminal is found guilty, they will not be free to support their family as work in prison is [not typically well-paid](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/)(One major surprise: prisons appear to be paying incarcerated people less today than they were in 2001. The average of the minimum daily wages paid to incarcerated workers for non-industry prison jobs is now 86 cents, down from 93 cents reported in 2001. The average maximum daily wage for the same prison jobs has declined more significantly, from $4.73 in 2001 to $3.45 today. What changed? At least seven states appear to have lowered their maximum wages, and South Carolina no longer pays wages for most regular prison jobs – assignments that paid up to $4.80 per day in 2001. With a few rare exceptions, regular prison jobs are still unpaid in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas.).
1.4.2.1.2. Con: The study claimed that family members of the victim of a murderer received more "closure" from the unending life in prison rather than the finality of execution. It is not clear at what point this closure occurred.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: While the victims mentioned in the study found the execution of the killer of their relative did not help them heal, neither did the alternative sentence.
1.4.2.2. Con: The death penalty does not sufficiently punish criminals as they will not experience the long-term struggles of imprisonment.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: The death penalty encourages the continuation of violence and brutality that would be better for society to move past.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The point of punishment is to satisfy the [vengeful spirit of victims](https://www.upcounsel.com/lectl-retribution-and-punishment-criminal-law-basics) in a organized, reasoned way. Without this, people may be led to vigilantism.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: If criminals receive the death penalty then families of victims will no longer have the opportunity to receive an apology.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Humanity kills millions of animals for the sole purpose of sustenance, demonstrating the value of life. The death penalty offers far greater utility and, thus, is a legitimate extension of this principle.
1.4.2.4. Pro: People responsible for crimes against humanity should not be allowed to live, given how their acts have degraded the human condition and moral fabric of society.
1.4.3. Con: The right to life is not absolute; it is legitimate to trade-off someone's life to keep others safe.
1.4.3.1. Con: No person has the moral authority to determine that another person deserves to die.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: This is a moral judgement that shouldn't be applied to the law; what deserves different penalties should not be left to perceived morality as it is so subjective.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The death penalty creates a vicious circle; everybody involved in another's death subsequently becomes a murderer, and on and on.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: Killing in defense of others is typically considered moral; this can be extrapolated to apply to the death penalty as it prevents future harm.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: Winners of nations' highest military honors are often those that have killed [large numbers](https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/15/us/adkins-medal-of-honor/index.html) of enemy troops in battle.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Since murder is justified in [self defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justifiable_homicide), the right to life is not particularly sacred.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: People are awarded with rights as long as they respect the [rights of others](http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/peace-means-respect-rights-others). Since the death penalty is often given to murderers, it is legitimate to infringe on their right to life.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Self defense is only legitimate as a last resort. In the case of the death penalty, there is time to act due to a lack of imminent threat. Thus, killing is unjustified.
1.4.3.3. Con: Properly restraining a criminal ensures others will be safe. Killing them is unnecessary and undermines the moral authority of the state when it condemns the immorality of murder.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: There are many ways a convicted killer, during the course of their life, [can find a way](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/i-am-a-killer/articles/jail-murders-why-inmates-kill-behind-bars) to kill another person either [within](https://www.newsweek.com/sheriff-deputy-wilson-knight-georgia-inmate-stab-death-1581533) the prison or outside.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Convicts can kill [while receiving medical treatment](https://www.iheart.com/content/2021-03-24-inmate-kills-nurse-and-correctional-officer-in-violent-assault/) or a [legal procedure outside of prison](https://www.wfsb.com/judge-assaulted-inside-courtroom-after-sentencing-defendant-to-life-in/article_3a063fc4-9677-577d-999f-52317c7b486c.html).
1.4.3.3.1.2. Pro: It's possible for convicted murderers to be released [due to administrative mix-up](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/us/florida-inmate-coronavirus-murder.html).
1.4.3.4. Pro: Giving a killer the death sentence will ensure that they do not do it again and hence saves innocent lives.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Self-preservation is a basic [human instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation). People want to prevent pain being inflicted on them and so it is only just that governments facilitate this with the death penalty.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: Punishing people for crimes they might commit in the future is unethical.
