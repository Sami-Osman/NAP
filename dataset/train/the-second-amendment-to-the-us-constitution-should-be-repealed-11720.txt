Discussion Name: The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution should be repealed.

1. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution should be repealed.
1.1. Con: Not having a guaranteed right to bear arms puts potential victims at risk of being unable to defend themselves.
1.1.1. Con: The Second Amendment can be repealed without taking away the right to defend themselves from American citizens.
1.1.2. Con: [Guns kept in the home](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/guns-in-the-homesafe-storage-statistics/) are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal unintentional shooting, criminal assault or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The risk of dying from an unintentional gunshot injury is [3.7 times higher for adults living in homes with guns](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/guns-in-the-homesafe-storage-statistics/).
1.1.2.2. Pro: Gun owners are more likely to successfully commit [suicide](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death) than non-gun owners.
1.1.2.3. Pro: States with more guns have higher [rates](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death) of accidental gun death.
1.1.2.4. Pro: The absence of guns from children’s homes and communities is the most [reliable](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death) and effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries in children and adolescents.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: Firearms accidents are not considered a [leading cause of childhood injury and death](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/pediatric/conditioninfo/causes). The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/safechild/pdf/cdc-childhoodinjury.pdf)doesn't even put firearms deaths in its own category for children.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Nearly [1300](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/1/e20163486) children die and 5790 are treated for gunshot wounds each year.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Mass shootings represent a tiny share of all shooting deaths. Suicide is a much bigger [deal](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000524/mass-shootings-rare).
1.1.2.6. Con: You do not have to kill or injure somebody to successfully use a gun to defend yourself. There are no reliable metrics for defensive gun uses. Estimates range [from 500,000 per year to 3 million a year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#2f88c2e6299a).
1.1.2.7. Pro: Unless extensively trained like law enforcement, [trying to use a gun as a defense during an attack is more likely to get you killed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=574&v=8QjZY3WiO9s) than if you did nothing.
1.1.2.7.1. Con: The lowest estimates of annual defensive gun use in the US is [55,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use). The total number of annual murders in the US is around [17,000](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/murder). If defensive gun use is "likely to get you killed", then a significant portion of those 55,000 would have swelled the murder total well above only 17,000.
1.1.2.7.2. Pro: Even highly trained law enforcement officers often accidentally injure or kill themselves or others with firearms.
1.1.2.7.3. Pro: Gun owners are more likely to be the victim of a [homicide](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death) than non-gun owners.
1.1.2.7.3.1. Pro: Guns are a significant [risk factor](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death) for domestic violence.
1.1.2.7.4. Pro: To shoot at an adversary one must put himself in the line of fire. It's physically impossible to fire at an enemy unless the weapon is placed into a position where the weapon \(and hence the shooter\) would be exposed to fire from that enemy's position.
1.1.2.7.5. Pro: Experts advise that potential victims have a better chance of survival if they try to run away or play dead than if they try to fight back.
1.1.2.7.6. Pro: Shooting at an adversary would risk drawing the adversary's attention to oneself.
1.1.2.7.7. Pro: People have an innate bias to believe that they're better at operating a firearm than they actually are; it's just like the standard bias that one is smarter or a better driver than one really is.
1.1.2.7.8. Pro: Until you're actually shot and/or killed, it's never too late to at least try your luck in running away or laying down/behind cover. That's almost always your best bet for survival unless you're a well-trained fighter.
1.1.2.7.9. Pro: Running away reduces the chance that a shooter will target you; it also dramatically reduces the likelihood that they'll hit you if they do choose to fire.
1.1.3. Con: Prevention is always more effective than cure. Investing in building strong local communities, coupled with strong deterrence measures, [takes away the likelihood of aggression](https://www.crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=448).
1.1.4. Con: Running away, calling police or using a baseball bat are just as effective a means of protection as using a [gun](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/25/self-defense-gun-debate/1945591/).
1.1.4.1. Con: Despite the opinion quoted in the parent's source, the article actually provides [evidence](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/25/self-defense-gun-debate/1945591/) that a gun is good protection.
1.1.5. Con: Without the Second Amendment, the number of arms in society as well as the threats faced by individuals would be lower, thus there would be less need for defense with guns.
1.1.5.1. Con: The threats faced by individuals are the crimes, not the means of forcing those crimes. Standard practice is to assume a robber has a weapon, regardless as to whether it can be seen.
1.1.5.2. Con: In the case of both victim and aggressor not having access to guns, the aggressor will be emboldened rather than discouraged, as they tend to already be physically stronger and now do not face the threat of being shot.
1.1.6. Pro: Those who are willing to break the law through either aggravated battery or other violent crimes will not be deterred from owning guns simply because it is made illegal. This will effectively guarantee that only criminals will own guns, giving them a distinct advantage over unarmed, law abiding citizens.
1.1.6.1. Con: Making such a thing illegal, or at least have more restrictions, would make it significantly harder for criminals to get guns. Obviously there will still be gun violence, but reducing the overall amount is better than leaving it as it is.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Making guns illegal purely makes it harder to get legal guns, though many can continue to gain access to illegal guns, despite restrictions. [6000](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Quick_Facts_Felon_in_Possession_of_a_Firearm.pdf) felons a year are arrested with illegal guns.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The majority of [gun crimes](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/)(Experts say most gun crime is likely committed by those who illegally possess guns.) are committed by those who illegally acquired their gun.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Between 1988-1997, there were [427](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16130640) bomb related deaths in the US and [more than 100,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Ushomicidesbyweapon.svg) gun related deaths. As acquiring bombs requires dealing with greater regulation than guns, this suggests that greater regulation resulted in fewer deaths.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether this difference can be explained with regulation. Various other factors make bomb-related deaths less common than gun-related deaths. Bombs, for example, are less easy to carry and not suitable for purposes such as self-defense.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: Heavy regulation of bombs has not prevented "good guys with bombs" from stopping "bad guys with bombs." Instead, it has largely prevented bad guys getting bombs in the first place.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1. Con: At an individual level, "good guys with bombs" can't stop "bad guys with bombs", regardless of legality. The logistics of this idea are false.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Firearms give equality to those who otherwise may not be able to defend themselves against a larger, stronger assailant. Taking away a tool used for self defense would further create more victims.
1.1.7. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment would not make gun ownership illegal.
1.1.7.1. Con: It would open the door to making gun ownership illegal.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: This is a slippery slope fallacy. Doing something does not necessitate doing a more extreme version of that thing.
1.1.7.2. Pro: It is highly unlikely that the federal government would or could enact an outright ban of weapons in the US.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: This step would go against a hallmark of America's identity and the country's historical origins in a revolutionary struggle.
1.1.8. Pro: The best equalizer in a fight is a firearm. A 250lb man will win almost all physical confrontations with a 120lb woman, but a firearm equalizes the fight. The same can be said of any physical advantage.
1.1.9. Pro: By refusing to allow citizens the right and responsibility to protect themselves, the government [becomes responsible](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/JLPP/upload/Rizzi-note-final.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjI7Oy_ptvbAhVRuVkKHTNTD6EQFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw259Qgr3w-odVM0dYwBnlP9) for their protection. This opens the floodgates to allow the government to be liable for every criminal act that could have reasonably been prevented with the ownership or use of a firearm.
1.1.10. Con: Since the [Dickey amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment) limits gun related research, and local to federal LEO’s don’t collect data on defensive uses of firearms starting with draw and threaten, there is no way to know if defensive uses are even relevant.
1.1.10.1. Con: This amendment applies to the sole Center for Disease Control and Prevention and public funding. This is not a strong limitation on the relevant research in general.
1.1.10.2. Con: Defensive use of firearms remain relevant regardless of the ability to demonstrate that use through statistical data.
1.1.11. Con: There are plenty of alternatives for self-defense apart from guns.
1.1.11.1. Con: Common methods of self defense \(pepperspray, tasers/stunguns, batons, martial arts\) offer an alternative in some instances but lack the efficacy, range, reliability and repeatability of a gun.
1.1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Guns require a homeowner to both hear and see an intruder. But these aren’t a problem for [guard dogs](https://www.offthegridnews.com/extreme-survival/better-than-a-gun-the-secret-to-finding-the-best-guard-dog-for-your-home/). They will smell and spot an intruder long before you. They can alert you to an unfamiliar presence before it comes close enough to cause harm, and should harm become imminent, the guard dog will naturally escalate its own response, barking, shielding its family and attacking if necessary.
1.1.11.3. Con: Guns act as an equalizer. Most people, regardless of physical stature or athletic ability, can train to defend themselves competently with firearms.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: Guns are not equalizers, since not all guns are equal.
1.1.11.3.1.1. Con: Not all guns are equalizers in all cases, but guns can eliminate the biggest discrepancy in combat- the physical abilities or their absence.
1.1.11.3.2. Con: If one person has a gun and another doesn't, those two are even more unequal in power than if both were unarmed. So unless you want a mandate to carry guns, there is no equalizing effect.
1.1.11.3.2.1. Con: There is absolutely and irrefutably an equalizing effect. If a person is armed they will be able to defend themselves in a wide variety of scenarios they otherwise may be completely defenseless in. Obviously, a prerequisite is that one must actually be armed, and perfect equality in outcomes cannot be obtained.
1.1.11.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.2. Con: Most Americans don't want to repeal the Second Amendment.
1.2.1. Con: Policy decisions shouldn't be made based on public opinion in a representative democracy.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Members of Congress have a free mandate which they receive through elections. Beyond that, they are bound solely to their conscience.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Politicians are heavily beholden to their donors and, to a somewhat lesser degree, their constituents.
1.2.1.2. Pro: The public is notoriously un- and misinformed. Its opinions should therefore not be the foundation of day-to-day decision making.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: According to a 2013 survey, the average American over-estimates the amount spent by the US on international aid [by a factor of 28](http://kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/2013-survey-of-americans-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/).
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Studies [show that](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413001522) "uninformed voters systematically vote out of line with their preferences." Public opinion is therefore not representative of public preferences.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Many Americans [hardly know](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/americans-are-poorly-informed-about-basic-constitutional-provisions/) their constitution. A third cannot say which rights the First Amendment protects, only a quarter can name the three branches of the government, and half think that illegal immigrants have no constitutional rights.
1.2.2. Pro: There's a [glamour](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-portraiture-gave-rise-glamour-guns-180968559/) to guns, created by pictures and decades of films and television.
1.2.2.1. Pro: It's rooted in the portrayal of the [hero with a gun](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-portraiture-gave-rise-glamour-guns-180968559/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-portraiture-gave-rise-glamour-guns-180968559/) and bolstered by real life examples.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The actual chance of being the [hero with a gun](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251894/number-of-justifiable-homicides-in-the-us/) is akin to being [struck by lightning](https://www.erieinsurance.com/blog/struck-by-lightning). Thus the [net benefits of owning a gun don't justify the risks](https://www.thetrace.org/2020/04/gun-safety-research-coronavirus-gun-sales/).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: There are people who understand that some fictional examples of gun use [aren't all they're made out to be](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring).
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The realistic chance of surviving a gun-fight against multiple opponents, however good a shot you are, is often [exaggerated](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring) in action movies.
1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Gun fights are sometimes [parodied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr2GeWiDrdY) on screen.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Glamor is attached to shootings by any protagonist, by their success at killing people, without any regard for whether the protagonist killing those people was justified or even if there was a good end to justify the means. For instance, the protagonist of movies or TV shows are frequently [villains, vigilantes](https://screenrant.com/best-movie-antiheroes-in-history/) or [traitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alamo_\(1960_film\)).
1.2.3. Pro: The vast majority of Americans would not repeal the Second Amendment. There is only 21% support for a [repeal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/27/one-in-five-americans-want-the-second-amendment-to-be-repealed-national-survey-finds/?utm_term=.964be661d861).
1.2.3.1. Con: The same [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/27/one-in-five-americans-want-the-second-amendment-to-be-repealed-national-survey-finds/?utm_term=.ae2f6d37a5cd) discusses surveys that "showed that a plurality of Americans do not see the Second Amendment as something set in stone."
1.3. Con: Several industries in America benefit from the Second Amendment and its implications. Repealing the Amendment would hurt those industries.
1.3.1. Pro: The sale of guns for sports and hunting fuels a major industry in the United States.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The industry for sporting arms and ammunition employs some 150.000 people directly and keeps the same number indirectly busy. It is responsible for about $52 billion in economic activity per year \([NSSF, p. 3](https://d3aya7xwz8momx.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-Economic-Impact.pdf)\).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Americans spend [some $25.6 billion](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/new-5-year-report-shows-1016-million-americans-participated-hunting-fishing-wildlife) per year on hunting.
1.3.1.3. Con: Scholars [argue that](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/3649/) hunting is "simultaneously protected and regulated without the direct involvement of the Second Amendment". Repealing the Amendment would, therefore, have little or no effect on hunting.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The gun ownership of Americans is tightly linked with hunting. About half of all gun owners take part in hunting at least once per year \([DeBell, p. 494](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=H_RrLyV9rDUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=GUNS+IN+AMERICAN+SOCIETY:+AN+ENCYCLOPEDIA+OF+HISTORY,+POLITICS,+CULTURE,+AND+THE+LAW&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLy9SUrvfiAhUcK6YKHZvxC7gQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.3.2. Pro: The annual revenue of the gun and ammunition manufacturing industry was [$13.5 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/02/americas-gun-business-by-the-numbers.html) and the gun industry as a whole employed [287,986](https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/18/news/economy/guns-jobs/index.html) people in 2015.
1.3.3. Con: This suggests that other industries wouldn't arise. The Second Amendment wasn't written to create or protect industries, but to protect our freedoms as citizens.
1.3.4. Con: A balance between industry and the positive outcomes of that industry for society needs to take a precedence. The same argument can also be applied elsewhere: we should legalise heroin because it would create a successful industry.
1.3.5. Pro: Ballistic experts and many forensic technicians owe their jobs to guns.
1.3.5.1. Con: No one has a right to have a particular job.
1.3.6. Con: People have rights; industries do not. Industries come and go as a function of the people's demands, and what may help or harm one in particular cannot take precedence over the rights of the people.
1.4. Pro: The Second Amendment was written in a context that is no longer relevant today.
1.4.1. Pro: It is not just the power of individual firearms that has advanced dramatically, it is the ability of manufacturers to generate a much larger number of weapons. Small fire arms per capita in civilian hands today far exceed the 1780s.
1.4.2. Pro: The Amendment is a product of its time. It refers to firearms that were far less powerful than what is widely available today.
1.4.2.1. Con: The Second Amendment refers to the Militia. The reference to "keep and bear arms" is a characteristic of the militia.
1.4.2.2. Con: The framers of the Second Amendment were well aware of the previous advancements in weapons systems; i.e. stones to spears to swords to bow and arrows to gunpowder and the resulting muskets of their day. They had to know there would be great advancements and inventions of fire power in the future.
1.4.2.3. Con: Yet the Framers wanted to guarantee to the American people the same level of firepower as the contemporary military powers of the time. A single shot musket in the late 18th century was at least the equivalent of an AR-15 today. The 2nd Amendment is therefore not conditioned upon the destructive power of the arms in question.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: If the Framers' intent was matching the level of firepower, then the Second Amendment guarantees citizens' ownership of nuclear weapons as well. The danger this alone [presents](https://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-bomb8.htm) is a good reason to repeal or amend the amendment.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: The danger posed by nuclear weapons is not a good reason to repeal the Second Amendment because even with the Second Amendment, the materials used in a nuclear weapon are already heavily regulated.
1.4.2.4. Con: There are multiple examples of weapons closer to the firepower of today that the Founders knew about.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: [Pepper-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper-box) revolvers could hold over 20 rounds and were developed hundreds of years before the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution..
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: The [Puckle gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puckle_gun) \(early gatling gun\) was created 60 years before the Revolutionary war.
1.4.2.4.2.1. Con: The Puckle gun was [nothing but a prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puckle_gun) that never saw combat usage and production on a large scale. It is unlikely that it made much of an impression on the framers of the Constitution, assuming they even knew about it.
1.4.2.4.3. Pro: The [Girandoni air rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_air_rifle), developed during the Revolutionary war, contained a 22 capacity magazine which could be fired within 30 seconds.
1.4.2.4.4. Pro: The [Belton flintlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belton_flintlock), developed during the Revolutionary War, could fire 20 or so rounds in 5 seconds with one pull of the finger.
1.4.2.5. Con: The variety of weapons in existence at that time and the failure of the founders to specify single-shot muskets or similar indicated their belief that all types of weaponry were valid for personal ownership.
1.4.2.6. Con: The Second Amendment allowed citizens to own [cannons](http://www.1812privateers.org/United%20States/PRINCE/usmarq.html) and even gatling guns \(after their invention\). These weapons were much stronger then single-shot muskets. It stands to reason that modern firearms would still be protected just the same.
1.4.2.6.1. Con: The potential lethality of today's most dangerous weapons could not have been foreseen when the constitution was written. Therefore, you cannot deduce that the writers of the constitution would allow all weapons today.
1.4.2.7. Con: The Amendment was written in the context of an era during which guns were widely available and gun ownership was very common.
1.4.3. Pro: The Second Amendment has to be understood in its historical context which involved militias - this context has changed.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Militias as they existed at the time of the Second Amendment were disbanded and no longer exist today.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The Framers of the Constitution [did not intend the US to operate a full-time professional army during peacetime](https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/52/army-clause) like the one we now have today. In the event of war, a national army takes time to stand up so Article I grants Congress the authority to "call forth" the militia to fill in the gap. The 2nd Amendment was written to ensure that the civilian population would have the capacity to fulfill Congress's demand if and when such forces were needed.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The Framers' [discussion](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1422048) of the right to bear arms at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted was almost invariably linked to discussion of the virtues of the militia and the dangers of standing armies in the late eighteenth century.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: [Twelve](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1422048) members of the House of Representatives spoke when the Amendment was under consideration in 1789; all discussed militia- and military-related issues, principally conscientious objection. Not one mentioned private self-defense, hunting, or gun collecting.
1.4.3.4. Con: Some functions of the militia are [still performed by organized volunteer and professional forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_\(United_States\)#Twentieth_century_and_current) under direct State and Federal command in addition to civilian militias which resemble armed political interest groups and have their own command structure.
1.4.3.5. Pro: The [crucial](https://medium.com/david-grace-columns-organized-by-topic/congress-rendered-the-second-amendment-obsolete-on-june-3-1916-c596671322a0) change made to the militia system by the Dick Act of 1903 was that members of the National Guard no longer furnished their own guns. From now on the National Guard would be armed with modern Army weapons at the expense of the Federal Government. Not only were NG no longer tasked with providing their own guns in the event of being called up, they were not allowed to bring their own guns even if they wanted to.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: The Dick Act continued the existence of the self-arming [Unorganized Militia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Act_of_1903). No crucial change to this institution occured.
1.4.3.6. Pro: The founding fathers [imagined](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) a militia as "little, if at all, inferior to \[the military\] in discipline and the use of arms" and on eye-level with it. Such a militia does not exist in the US.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: Even if armed, many Americans could hardly put up much of a fight [for physical reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States). In most states, a quarter to a third of adults are obese; another third of the population is overweight.
1.4.3.6.1.1. Con: Most Americans are not obese and even one-third of Americans would still vastly outnumber any military force on Earth.
1.4.3.6.1.2. Con: While physical fitness is helpful in combat situations, the primary purpose of firearms is to compensate for physical disparities. The American obesity rate is further justification for more people to own firearms.
1.4.3.6.1.3. Pro: The fatness of Americans is already [posing a problem](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/10/15/too-fat-to-fight-military-threatened-by-childhood-obesity.html) for military recruiting as overweight and obesity reduce the pool of candidates capable of joining.
1.4.3.6.2. Pro: James Madison [spoke of](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp) the militia as a force for which it "may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by \[...\] regular troops".
1.4.3.6.2.1. Con: America has over 300 million guns. James Madison was not wrong when he [wrote](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp), an oppressive army "would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops."
1.4.3.6.2.2. Con: In America, there are 1.3 million [troops](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/22/us/is-americas-military-big-enough.html) but among civilians there are 20 million military [veterans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/10/the-changing-face-of-americas-veteran-population/) including 5 million veterans under the age of 50. As Hamilton [wrote](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp), these civilians form "a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior... in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens" as long as civilians have the right to bear arms.
1.4.3.6.2.2.1. Con: Since 1788, the disparity between military grade weapons and civilian small arms has grown to the point that no body of civilians, regardless of size, could possibly defend against a military attack.
1.4.3.6.2.2.1.1. Con: The current trend is towards asymmetrical warfare, where larger weapons of mass destruction are not as useful in fighting the opposing forces.  In asymmetrical warfare the technology disparity is not as relevant as the total count of participants.
1.4.3.6.3. Pro: Alexander Hamilton [spoke of](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) the militia as troops for which it would be "necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year" to ensure at least a minimum of capability and preparedness. This does not happen in the US.
1.4.3.6.3.1. Con: The [USTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academi#United_States_Training_Center) operated by Academi in North Carolina is the largest private firearms training center in the world. USTC offers tactics and weapons training to military, government, and law enforcement agencies as well as several open-enrollment courses periodically throughout the year for civilians.
1.4.3.6.3.2. Con: Hamilton [wrote](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp), "the project of disciplining ALL the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious" \[emphasis mine\]. Hamilton was advocating, for a "select core" of militia that would assemble often and would develop "a tolerable expertness in military movements" because that "is a business that requires time and practice." Hamilton was describing [privatized military](https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Warriors-Privatized-Military-Industry/dp/0801474361) groups which does happen in the US.
1.4.3.6.4. Pro: American gun owners are not necessarily qualified to use their guns. [About 40%](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/24/2/161) report not having received any formal training. In most cases, this training covered safety and gun handling but not necessarily actual combat.
1.4.3.6.4.1. Con: A [majority](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/24/2/161) of US firearm owners have received formal firearm training. Over 125,000 certified [NRA](https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/) instructors train about 1,000,000 gun owners a year. Nearly 6,000 people annually compete in NRA National Matches which is one of the biggest sporting events held in America. More than one million youth are also participating in NRA shooting events.
1.4.3.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.2.2.
1.4.3.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.4.1.
1.4.3.6.6. Con: The "[Privatized Military Industry](https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Warriors-Privatized-Military-Industry/dp/0801474361)" encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of civilians, and billions of dollars. Such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. They have become a key element in U.S. military operations. They are not considered significantly inferior to the military in discipline or use of arms.
1.4.3.6.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.2.1.
1.4.3.6.8. Pro: Permissive as American gun regulation may be, the limitations it imposes on gun ownership make it hard to imagine that armed civilians could effectively counter military forces.
1.4.3.6.8.1. Pro: There are various examples that show how even well-armed non-government forces fare badly against government forces.
1.4.3.6.8.1.1. Pro: We can witness how well an armed resistance against an [extremely advanced army](https://imeu.org/article/comparison-of-millitary-strength-of-israel-and-the-palestinians) works in the Israel-Palestine conflict, where Israel clearly has the upper hand.
1.4.3.6.8.1.1.1. Pro: Palestinians have no shortage of RPGs, ammunition and AK47s and still do not stand any chance against Israel.
1.4.3.6.8.1.2. Pro: We can witness how well the Kurds have fared against the Turks. They have never been able to establish their independent country within the border of Turkey.
1.4.3.6.8.1.2.1. Pro: The majority of casualties in the Turkish-Kurdish conflict have been [Kurdish civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict_\(1978%E2%80%93present\)). This illustrates that they are clearly consistently losing military exchanges.
1.4.3.6.8.1.2.2. Pro: After decades of conflict, the PKK announced that it would be [withdrawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict_\(1978%E2%80%93present\)) all of its forces from Turkey to Iraq in 2013. This indicates that the PKK has been incapable of making any territorial gains and has instead been forced to retreat.
1.4.3.6.8.2. Pro: Although legal, it is [very difficult and highly expensive](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/its-still-legal-to-own-a-machine-gun-its-also-extremely-difficult-and-especially-expensive) to acquire fully-automatic weapons in the US. In contrast: the standard rifles of most American soldiers - [such as the M4A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_carbine#M4A1), are fully-automatic.
1.4.3.6.8.2.1. Con: While it is expensive to own fully-automatic weapons in the US, machine guns are widely available [for rent](https://www.smokinggunsd.com/firearms/machine-guns.html) making it possible for large numbers of the militia to train using fully-automatic weapons.
1.4.3.6.8.2.2. Con: Despite the expense of legally owning fully-automatic weapons, the ATF reports there are [630,019](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/undefined/firearms-commerce-united-states-annual-statistical-update-2017/download) registered machine guns in the US. That means, civilians own 1 machine gun for every 2 active duty soldiers.
1.4.3.6.8.2.3. Con: While it is difficult and expensive to legally purchase fully-automatic weapons in the US, the [STEN gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten) proved that it's not difficult or expensive to construct a machine gun anywhere that has a rudimentary machine shop.
1.4.3.6.8.3. Con: There are many examples of armed civilians fighting effectively against military forces, from one-on-one encounters such as [Ben Kanahele](http://www.historynet.com/the-niihau-incident.htm) in Niihau to 100,000 civilians in [Private Military Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company) in Iraq.
1.4.3.6.8.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.8.2.1.
1.4.3.6.8.5. Con: If the government decided to start an all-out war against its citizenry, then they would likely have no economy left to stand on and would quickly be conquered by another world power. There is no incentive for the government to go against the majority.
1.4.3.6.8.6. Con: The U.S. military has a horrible track record of winning fights against armed insurgencies, all of which have had vastly inferior equipment to the U.S. military.
1.4.3.6.8.6.1. Con: All of these armed insurgencies took place on foreign soil, where America was unfamiliar with the terrain, customs, and/or language of the people they were fighting. This wouldn't be true in an American insurgency.
1.4.3.6.8.6.1.1. Con: America has so much more private production, personal vehicles, territory, population, money, arms and ammunition that a fight in the US would be much worse than Afghanistan or Vietnam. It is a problem of scale - the Vietcong never had a weapon for every man, woman and child.
1.4.3.6.8.6.2. Pro: After two decades of fighting a Taliban insurgency for control over Afghanistan, the United States is generally not seen as a victor and oftentimes described [as losing ground](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/03/afghanistan-war-helmand-taliban-us-womens-rights-peace).
1.4.3.6.8.6.3. Pro: America proved largely unable to achieve its goals in Vietnam and saw South Vietnam fall in 1975, in part because of its inability to deal with insurgencies.
1.4.3.6.8.7. Con: If expected to fire upon American civilians en mass, some of the U.S. military personnel would desert, thus reducing military strength.
1.4.3.6.8.8. Pro: We know how even a pretty well equipped Iraq army, was twice easily squashed by US military might.
1.4.3.6.8.9. Pro: Even if a sufficiently large advanced 21st century military could never force an armed civilian population to surrender, they could definitely subdue them to the point where they would successfully control and occupy the country, bending the will of the civilian population to do as the military wants.
1.4.3.6.8.10. Pro: As modern armed forces are moving towards autonomous fighting machines, humans will become less and less effective at fighting [them](https://www.kialo.com/autonomous-fighting-machines-the-future-of-warfare-486/486.0=486.1+486.475).
1.4.3.6.9. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.2.2.
1.4.3.6.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.4.3.6.11. Con: Hamilton considered the militia to include every able bodied man, not just the men disciplined in the use of arms. In [The Farmer Refuted](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-01-02-0057), Hamilton estimates the size of the militia response to a foreign invasion by "computing the number of men, capable of bearing arms in any nation, is by taking a fifth part of the whole people. By the best calculations we are supposed in America, to exceed three millions. The fifth part of three millions is 600,000."
1.4.3.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.6.
1.4.3.8. Pro: The phrase "well regulated militia" was intended to mean something similar to the current [National Guard](http://prospect.org/article/well-regulated-militia). It didn't mean that everyone should have a gun for self defense. America already has a National Guard, so the Second Amendment is no longer needed.
1.4.3.8.1. Con: This argument is predicated upon a premise of interpretation which is at odds with the [Supreme Court's](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/second-amendment.php) interpretation.
1.4.3.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.5.
1.4.3.8.3. Con: [Kopel writes](http://www.davekopel.org/2A/LawRev/Great-gun-control-war-20th-century.pdf), "In 1903, the same year that Congress established the modern organized militia as the National Guard, Congress also acted to bolster training for the unorganized militia-defined by statute as all able-bodied males aged eighteen to forty-five, with a few exceptions. See 10 U.S.C. § 311 \(2006\)."
1.4.3.8.4. Con: [Kates writes](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=133113085074065112103127065107029112006064056058069029104004017119110007112028125067098033019101022122010127084076082064102112059052014001081099125025064064122116100018049010096029096122095009100074013098080116071007111067019124103025029025093101025103&EXT=pdf), "if they focus on the amendment's wording at all, it is only on the word 'militia,' assuming that the Framers meant 'militia' to refer to 'a particular military force,' i.e., the states' home reserve, now federalized as the National Guard. In fact, though not unknown in the 18th Century, that usage was wholly secondary to the one Webster classifies as now least used. 'The whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service.'"
1.4.3.8.4.1. Pro: If we are all the militia, then the government is granted the right to regulate arms for everybody where the 2nd amendment states "well regulated militia." This is an astute point, but it contradicts your overall claim.
1.4.3.8.5. Con: [John F. Kennedy said](http://quotes.liberty-tree.ca/quote_blog/John.F..Kennedy.Quote.B160), "Although it is extremely unlikely that the fear of governmental tyranny, which gave rise to the 2nd amendment, will ever be a major danger to our Nation, the amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic military-civilian relationship, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason I believe the 2nd Amendment will always be important."
1.4.3.8.5.1. Pro: The Constitution announced that the militia's purpose pertains to national security and law enforcement.
1.4.3.8.5.1.1. Pro: The Constitution gives Congress the authority "to provide for the calling of the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions." \(Art. 1 sec. 8 clause 15\)
1.4.3.8.5.2. Con: John F. Kennedy's beliefs do not usurp the authority of the US Constitution. Only the court has the authority to review and amend constitutional law.
1.4.3.8.6. Con: Founder Richard Henry [Lee wrote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee) the militia includes, "all men capable of bearing arms" and goes on, "all regulations tending to render this general militia useless and defenceless, by establishing select corps of militia, or distinct bodies of military men, not having permanent interests and attachments in the community to be avoided."
1.4.3.9. Pro: The amendment says that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. The right to bear arms is based on that assumption. But the assumption is clearly wrong, since there hasn't been a well-regulated militia in the US for quite a while.
1.4.3.9.1. Pro: Australia, just as one of many examples, is a free state, and guns are virtually entirely banned there. If the [current Supreme Court interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) of the second amendment is correct, then Australia proves the 2nd amendment wrong.
1.4.3.9.1.1. Con: This is a logical fallacy called [denying the antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent) or inverse fallacy. It works by saying that something can't be true because its opposite condition isn't false, and is illogical.
1.4.3.9.1.2. Con: [Blackstone](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/freestate.pdf) wrote, "nothing... ought to be more guarded against in a free state, than making the military power... a body too distinct from the people." That opinion was enshrined in the 2nd Amendment.
1.4.3.9.1.2.1. Pro: A state's freedom might be secure but it's not as secure as it could be if the right to keep and bear arms is reserved to the military and excluded from the people.
1.4.3.9.1.2.2. Con: This would imply that Australia's freedom is hanging by a thread. It is not.
1.4.3.9.1.2.3. Con: The Armed Forces in modern times serve a democratically elected executive and are drawn from citizenry, therefore negating the preconditions that Blackstone set for the Second Amendment to be necessary to keep a state "secure".
1.4.3.9.1.3. Con: The Second Amendment claims that a well-regulated militia is necessary for security. The Amendment's text and the Supreme Court didn't argue that the Amendment is necessary for a free state to exist but merely for its security.
1.4.3.9.1.3.1. Pro: The [Supreme Court held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Decision), "The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause."
1.4.3.9.1.3.2. Con: If you can't have a secure and free state without a well-regulated militia and you can't have a well-regulated militia without a right to bear arms, then you can't have a secure and free state without a right to bear arms.
1.4.3.9.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.9.1.2.
1.4.3.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.3.9.4. Pro: The [Founding Fathers](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_8_15.html) incorporated the 2nd Amendment with the intention of ensuring that armed militias would retain their capacity to respond with force in order to "execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions."
1.4.3.9.4.1. Pro: The 2nd Amendment does not include language protecting a right to bear arms for civilian purposes like hunting and self-defense.
1.4.3.9.5. Con: If a well-regulated militia were not useful for security then the government would have no use for laws that regulate the militia. But as of 2019, United States law still characterizes and defines the militia in [10 U.S. Code § 246](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246).
1.4.3.9.6. Pro: The drafters of the Amendment intended the militia clause in the 2nd Amendment to be operative, not merely prefatory. Historians report that there was much debate over the placement of the words.
1.4.3.9.6.1. Pro: If it were merely explanatory it would be a solitary exception in the whole Bill of Rights.
1.4.3.9.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.4.3.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.1.
1.4.3.9.8. Con: -> See 1.4.3.4.
1.4.3.9.9. Pro: In practice, the federal government now maintains a sizeable permanent professional army which displaces much of the need for a militia.
1.4.3.9.10. Pro: In June of 1916 Congress enacted the National Defense Act which was the death knell for the old militia system. [Section 61](https://medium.com/david-grace-columns-organized-by-topic/congress-rendered-the-second-amendment-obsolete-on-june-3-1916-c596671322a0) made it illegal for any state to maintain any troops in peacetime except as authorized by the National Defense Act. The states were now forbidden to operate any militia except one that qualified under the National Defense Act itself. Gone were the reserve militias and only the National Guard was left.
1.4.3.9.10.1. Con: The Unorganized Militia is still part of [US law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246), existing as it has since the founding of the US.
1.4.3.9.11. Pro: There is little to no evidence that the [founders](https://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/06/thoughts-on-heller-from-real-historian.html) believed that they were enacting a right to bear arms for civilian purposes like hunting and self-defense.
1.4.3.9.12. Con: America's [militia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militia) has been called upon many times. There are currently over [1.3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) members of the [unorganized militia](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246) who have volunteered for active service to protect the security of our free state.
1.4.3.9.12.1. Con: They could have volunteered without previously owning weapons. This is called basic training.
1.4.3.9.12.1.1. Con: There's nothing above this claim which asserts volunteers are required to have owned weapons or have prior training. While prior training has proven to be helpful, it is by no means required.
1.4.3.9.13. Con: It is the ability of the people to form a militia separate from any level of government that secures freedom. Removing this freedom will not cause an immediate reduction of other freedoms, but the second amendment is to protect future generations, not either side of the current political divide.
1.4.3.9.14. Con: Reasoning that since there has not been a well-regulated militia in the US for "quite a while" isn't a solid basis for suggesting it won't be necessary.
1.4.3.9.14.1. Con: Plenty of other states manage to stay free and secure without a well-regulated militia. Thus, there is little reason to assume that it commonly becomes necessary.
1.4.3.9.15. Con: In recent years there have been [various militia groups](http://www.researchforprogress.us/rwpop/nwo.html) operating in various states. "During the mid-1990s, armed militias were sporadically active in all fifty states, with total membership estimated at between 20,000 and 60,000."
1.4.3.9.15.1. Con: These are not militias in the sense [the founding fathers meant](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html), since they don't reduce the threat that a national standing army might pose to the security of the separate states.
1.4.3.9.15.1.1. Con: According to [Stevens](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html), the founders intended the militia to counter the "concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states".  If the size and firepower of the militia is insufficient to perform that function that does not mean the militia is not a militia. It only means the militia needs to be larger.
1.4.3.9.15.1.1.1. Con: If the militia was insufficient, this would mean the US is not a free and safe state.
1.4.3.9.15.1.1.1.1. Con: A threat to security does not equate to an elimination of freedom.
1.4.3.9.15.1.2. Con: Rather than increasing the size of the national standing army, the US has instead relied on civilian, [private military](https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Warriors-Privatized-Military-Industry/dp/0801474361) groups for national defense. By limiting the size of the army, the existence and use of armed civilians has reduced the threat that a national standing army might pose to the security of the separate states which is exactly as the founders had hoped.
1.4.3.9.15.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.8.6.
1.4.3.9.16. Con: The definition of [militia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militia) includes "the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service."
1.4.3.9.16.1. Con: If one were to use this definition in the context of the 2nd amendment, carrying guns would have nothing to do with well-regulated militias and the amendment would be a non-sequitur.
1.4.3.9.16.1.1. Con: Founder [Richard Henry Lee](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee) wrote the militia includes, "all men capable of bearing arms ... it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them."
1.4.3.9.16.1.2. Con: The founders believed that proficiency at arms contributes to a well regulated militia so it's a reasonable sequitur to add, "the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed." There's no evidence that the Second Amendment is a non-sequitur. The amendments were carefully crafted by thoughtful authors.
1.4.3.9.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.16.1.1.
1.4.3.9.16.3. Pro: Founder [James Madison](http://www.madisonbrigade.com/library_bor_2nd_amendment.htm) wrote, "a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural and safe defence of a free state".
1.4.3.9.16.4. Pro: [Almost all](https://www.sss.gov/Registration-Info/Who-Registration) male U.S. citizens and male immigrants, who are 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service.
1.4.3.9.16.4.1. Con: The Selective Service is designed to provide conscripts for service in the professional [military](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim\@title50/chapter49&edition=prelim). This is different from a [militia](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-militia-and-military-force). Military personnel are issued their arms by the government whereas the 2nd Amendment concerns arms borne by civilians.
1.4.3.9.16.4.1.1. Pro: The US Constitution, Article I, has separate provisions for the calling forth of militia and the raising of armies.
1.4.3.9.16.4.1.2. Pro: The training of militias and the commissioning of their officers is the exclusive responsibility of the States or civilian leaders and these forces must be "called up" by the Federal government and only then does their command fall under Fed control. In this way the SS registry resembles a sort of non-active militia.
1.4.3.9.16.5. Pro: In Presser v. Illinois, [Justice Woods](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/116/252/) wrote "It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States... \[no state may\] prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security".
1.4.3.9.16.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.8.3.
1.4.3.9.16.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.8.4.
1.4.3.9.16.8. Pro: [Malcolm writes](http://www.constitution.org/mil/maltrad.htm), "for all able-bodied men there was also the civic duty to bear arms in the militia" and "every American colony formed a militia that, like its English model, comprised all able-bodied male citizens."
1.4.3.9.16.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.8.5.
1.4.3.9.16.10. Pro: [Rakove writes](https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=3289&context=cklawreview), "the concept of the militia had a fixed and consensually accepted meaning in ordinary usage, so that it was essentially coterminous with the free adult male population physically capable of bearing arms; and if the language of the Constitution is not to be rendered completely plastic, modern interpretation has to preserve that meaning."
1.4.3.9.16.11. Con: If the militia consists of all people, then that reinforces the state's power to regulate all weapons because the amendment clearly grants the power to the government to regulate said militias.
1.4.3.9.16.11.1. Con: The power to regulate ends where the regulation violates the purpose of the amendment to provide a populace armed with military weapons.
1.4.3.9.16.12. Con: If the 2nd Amendment is intended to maintain the militia, and the militia is all able-bodied men, then the right of women and the elderly to own guns is not explicitly protected by the 2nd amendment
1.4.3.9.16.13. Pro: In "Firearms Law and the Second Amendment", the authors [write](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008R1DZUQ/ref=kinw_clar_choose1?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0), "eligible voters was very similar to the class of persons liable to perform militia duty - namely, free white adult males."
1.4.3.10. Pro: Militias of the size and role that they had in the 18th and 19th century do not exist anymore in the US. At the time, they were the essential means for American defense.
1.4.3.10.1. Pro: In various battles of the Revolutionary War, militias contributed to the victory of the American colonies over the British.
1.4.3.10.1.1. Pro: Militias composed of [minutemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen) fought in the battles of [Lexington and Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord) where they drove back British forces.
1.4.3.10.1.2. Pro: About half of the American forces during the [Battles of Saratoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga), which led to a decisive victory for the colonies, were composed of militias.
1.4.3.10.2. Pro: In the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom, the majority of American soldiers were militia. At the time, there was a "genuine reliance" on the militia as a "main defense force" \([Skeen, p. 1, 3](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=EbEeBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=war+1812+militia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikxPul1IDiAhWLBKYKHXl6DeQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=war%201812%20militia&f=false)\).
1.4.3.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.9.
1.4.3.10.4. Con: The continued existence of the [Selective Service](https://www.sss.gov/Registration-Info/Who-Registration) is evidence that many people consider the American militia is still essential for national defense.
1.4.3.10.5. Pro: Militias were essential for defense because America's standing army was [largely disbanded](https://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-u-s-armed-forces) after the Revolutionary War.
1.4.3.10.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.9.16.
1.4.3.11. Con: -> See 1.4.3.9.15.
1.4.3.12. Con: -> See 1.4.3.9.16.
1.4.4. Con: The threats against which the Second Amendment was meant to protect America are still as relevant today as they were when it was written.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.4.2. Con: Many of these threats don't exist anymore. The military as well as police on the federal, state, country and local level have come a long way since then and provide sufficient protection.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: If the military as well as the federal, state and local law enforcement provided "sufficient" protection, then we would have no rapes, robberies or murders. As it is, guns were used by law abiding citizens to protect themselves or others [at least 300,000 times from 2014 to 2016](http://vpc.org/studies/justifiable18.pdf). That's an average of 100,0000 justifiable defensive uses of a firearm every year.
1.4.4.3. Pro: As history illustrates, the right to bear arms enables citizens to resist against government tyranny.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Arms enable citizens to undermine the government's monopoly and violence on launch meaningful resistance.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: The [Vietcong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong), which fought against American invasion during the Vietnamese war, was full of armed peasants.
1.4.4.3.2.1. Con: Vietnamese militia and regular military forces received [significant material support](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8kw3k7/revision/8) from the Soviet Union. The analogy would be if a US ally gave aid to the militia in order to help repel an invasion.
1.4.4.3.2.2. Con: The US military was expelled from Vietnam not just by peasants but at the hands of a highly disciplined, capable and motivated regular military force: the North Vietnamese Army.
1.4.4.3.2.2.1. Con: The US military was not routed in Vietnam and pulled out in an orderly manner when political support for South Vietnam collapsed in the US.
1.4.4.3.2.3. Con: The United States' failure in Vietnam was caused just as much by a non-viable US strategy as it was the capacity of its adversary to fight. In order to avoid provoking China, the US all but [conceded](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/32281/why-did-the-united-states-not-invade-north-vietnam) North Vietnam to the NVA allowing the enemy a relatively uncontested base of operations from which to attack the South.
1.4.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: This would have been a re-play of the Korean War, which developed into a stalemate.
1.4.4.3.2.4. Con: Victory was achieved rather through [demoralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War).
1.4.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: Following the resignation of President Nixon the Congress effectively forced an end to the war.
1.4.4.3.3. Con: The civilian militia alone lacks the capability defeat or depose and was never intended to confront a powerful nation-state. The Founders having already lived through a revolution [knew that full well](https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/52/army-clause). That is why the Constitution gives Congress power to raise a professional army specifically in the case of war.
1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: If good government actually came from a violent, armed population, then Afghanistan and Somalia would be the two best-governed places on earth.
1.4.4.3.3.2. Pro: One of the [downsides](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/antigovernment) of that interpretation with regards to resisting tyranny is that some people will [incorrectly](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/constitutional-myth-6-the-second-amendment-allows-citizens-to-threaten-government/241298/) conclude that it would be OK to violently threaten the authorities based on a mere personal disagreement with the government. This is wrongful and puts the lives of officials at risk.
1.4.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: The 2nd Amendment's purposes did not include that the militia would confront a "tyrannical" national army. To say that the 2nd Amendment is a hedge against tyranny is only true in the sense that the Founders protected the militia in part to avert the need for a standing national army during peacetime which they found dangerous to democracy.
1.4.4.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: The US Constitution does not [include](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8/clause-15%E2%80%9316) confronting a national standing army in its list of missions assigned to the militia.
1.4.4.3.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The possibility is virtually nil that a US national army under the current Constitution could ever become so corrupt that it allowed the mass persecution of its own population.
1.4.4.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: The common misconception that the Second Amendment protects an individual gun owner's right to resist government tyranny is a myth [propagated by the NRA, starting in the 1970's](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/nra-second-amendment-guns-violence), in order to advance the profit motives of their [primary constituents](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-industry-funds-nra-2013-1), the weapons manufacturing industry.
1.4.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Jared Lee Loughner was reportedly obsessed with the [US Constitution](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jared-lee-loughner-and-the-constitution) and believed that the government was a tyranny. The tone of Loughner's online writings and videos from immediately before the attack were almost exclusively conservative and anti-government, with echoes of the populist Tea Party movement which was politically if not militarily insurgent.
1.4.4.3.3.2.2.1. Pro: Loughner's position that currency not backed by a gold or silver standard is worthless is a hallmark of the far right and the militia [movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner#Views_on_politics).
1.4.4.3.3.2.3. Pro: Donald Trump [hinted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment) at the assassination of Hillary Clinton by gun rights supporters, saying ‘second amendment people’ could stop Democrat choosing undesirable supreme court justices if she is elected.
1.4.4.3.3.2.4. Pro: In [2014](https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL1N1P313I) a "revolt" by armed militia preventing the enforcement of a court-ordered roundup of Bundy’s cattle by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, after the rancher had refused to pay federal grazing fees, forced police and federal agents to retreat rather than risk bloodshed. Hundreds of supporters, many of them armed, rallied at his ranch in a show of force to demand the return of his impounded livestock.
1.4.4.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: The Bundy-affiliated militia are [domestic terrorists](https://web.archive.org/web/20140516064101/http://www.salon.com/2014/05/14/you_need_to_die_cliven_bundy_and_violent_militias_still_terrorizing_utah_nevada/), and their attempts to violently resist the government are unlawful and contribute to civil unrest.
1.4.4.3.3.2.5. Pro: When armed civilians [overthrow a government](https://www.prindlepost.org/2017/11/moral-legacy-bolshevik-revolution/) it doesn't always end well. For example, in the 1920s the Bolsheviks overthrew the Russian monarchy. A country that would have been far more democratic, peaceful and prosperous turned into a notorious authoritarian state, resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of people and destabilizing the entire world.
1.4.4.3.3.2.5.1. Pro: Federal employees stated their [families were bullied](https://www.hcn.org/articles/opinion-with-a-pardon-trump-perpetuates-bundy-standoff) by some of the men with assault rifles who came from across the West to join in Ammon Bundys’ protest. The people who worked for the government were members of the community — coaches of Little League teams and volunteers in churches who also served in local government. But the Bundy supporters treated them like enemies.
1.4.4.3.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.4.
1.4.4.3.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.4.1.
1.4.4.3.3.2.6. Pro: In a June 8, 2014 Las Vegas shooting two police officers inside a restaurant were killed in an ambush-style attack, which was committed by a married couple who held anti-government views and who intended to use the shooting to start a revolution.
1.4.4.3.3.2.7. Pro: A misconception that the Second Amendment permits citizens to violently contest federal authority encourages the perpetrating of [terrorist](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism) offenses involving persons holding anti-government views who intend to commit shootings or other violent offenses as a means for starting a revolution.
1.4.4.3.3.2.8. Pro: Tea Party candidate [Sharron Angle](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sharron-angle-floated-2nd_n_614003) Floated ‘2nd Amendment Remedies’ As ‘Cure’ For ‘The Harry Reid Problems’
1.4.4.3.3.2.9. Pro: The [Bundy standoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge) was not a constitutionally-protected activity; it was a criminal offense, namely rebellion. The Freedom of Speech does not protect the right to bear arms. Openly carrying a weapon is not speech. It's the display of raw power.
1.4.4.3.3.2.9.1. Con: The Bundy Standoff was a protest and sit-in, not a rebellion.
1.4.4.3.3.2.9.1.1. Con: Participants in the Bundy standoff were heavily armed and threatened federal officers with deadly force, thus violently [coercing](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cliven-bundy-protesters-allegedly-pointed-rifles-at-feds) said officers to withdraw from performing their lawful duties.
1.4.4.3.3.3. Pro: If the founders had intended the militia to be a check against Federal power they wouldn't have given Congress the authority to nationalize or "call up" the militia.
1.4.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: [Hamilton](https://medium.com/david-grace-columns-organized-by-topic/congress-rendered-the-second-amendment-obsolete-on-june-3-1916-c596671322a0)wrote: If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the National security.
1.4.4.3.3.4. Pro: One of the missions of the civilian militia is to defend the national government [against insurrection.](https://medium.com/david-grace-columns-organized-by-topic/congress-rendered-the-second-amendment-obsolete-on-june-3-1916-c596671322a0)
1.4.4.3.3.4.1. Pro: The federal government [called up the militia to suppress domestic insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_\(United_States\)#Confederation_period_\(1783%E2%80%931787\)) during the early years of the republic. In 1794, it put the militias of six states under federal control to quash the Whiskey Rebellion and again in 1859 when Virginia militiamen and U.S. Army soldiers put down John Brown’s anti-slavery insurrection.
1.4.4.3.3.5. Pro: Treason is the only crime the Framers believed important enough for the Constitution to condemn explicitly. Armed insurrection against the US is treason.
1.4.4.3.3.6. Pro: The Civil War's outcome proves that insurrection cannot defeat the US.
1.4.4.3.3.6.1. Con: The Civil War was not an insurrection but a secession. No attempt was made to overthrow the federal government.
1.4.4.3.3.6.1.1. Con: The Civil War was an insurrection to usurp Federal authority, sovereignty and jurisdiction over a portion of its lawful territory.
1.4.4.3.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.6.8.
1.4.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.1.
1.4.4.3.5. Con: The protection against tyranny provided by the Right to Bear Arms was a long-term structural guarantee to maintain the separation of powers and federalism, not a privilege to actually use those arms to resist government [authority](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/constitutional-myth-6-the-second-amendment-allows-citizens-to-threaten-government/241298/).
1.4.4.3.6. Con: The United States is an [indestructible union](https://www.britannica.com/event/Texas-v-White) from which no state can secede.
1.4.4.3.6.1. Pro: It is a criminal [offense](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383) to incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or give aid or comfort thereto.
1.4.4.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.
1.4.4.3.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.8.
1.4.4.3.8. Pro: In 1989, the citizens of [Romania](http://books.google.com/books?id=vBssmkvaSoQC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=romanian+revolution+%22armed+civilians%22&source=bl&ots=Y1Nu7rpjL_&sig=psxp1I6zNz27h2ue0ce3IyYjjBU&hl=ko&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=romanian%20revolution%20%22armed%20civilians%22&f=false) violently overthrew longtime Communist Party General Secretary Nicolae Ceaușescu. The National Salvation Front then took power and installed a series of economic and [democratic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution).
1.4.4.3.8.1. Con: Some were violent, but the Romanian revolution, as most revolutions when Communist regimes fell, was mostly non-violent, just people showing up on the street protesting the current regime.
1.4.4.3.8.2. Con: Even if the Romanian uprising could have been called violent, which it was only at the fringes, this doesn't mean that they were well armed.
1.4.4.3.8.2.1. Pro: The article itself refers to only [600](https://books.google.com/books?id=vBssmkvaSoQC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=romanian+revolution+%22armed+civilians%22&source=bl&ots=Y1Nu7rpjL_&sig=psxp1I6zNz27h2ue0ce3IyYjjBU&hl=ko&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=romanian%20revolution%20%22armed%20civilians%22&f=false) weapons being distributed in a confrontation of [hundreds of thousands of unarmed people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution) vs the government.
1.4.4.3.9. Pro: In 1990, the Tutsi citizens of [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Civil_War) \(many in exile\) violently overthrew Hutu president Habyarimana.
1.4.4.3.9.1. Con: The Rwanda civil war was mostly fought with very primitive home-made weapons, clubs with nails, machetes etc, as private gun ownership in Rwanda is very [low](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/rwanda).
1.4.4.3.10. Pro: Many of history's [most brutal regimes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-gun-history/) banned or confiscated private firearms prior to committing genocidal acts, implying that such weapons in the hands of the populace could have helped prevent these acts from happening in the first place.
1.4.4.3.10.1. Pro: [Targeted firearm confiscation](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-gun-history/) of populations deemed dissident or rebellious was enforced under the regime of Josef Stalin, which left millions vulnerable to imprisonment and death as a result of the Soviet [collectivization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union) attempt.
1.4.4.3.10.2. Pro: In 1915 the Young Turks enacted a set of measures against the Armenians [including an order](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/timestopics/topics_armeniangenocide.html) to hand over any owned weapons to the authorities. Those who owned them were transferred to labor camps where they were either killed outright or died of overwork, while the remaining Armenians were left unarmed to defend against the genocide that ultimately claimed 1.5 million lives.
1.4.4.3.10.3. Pro: The [1938 Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany#Gun_regulation_of_the_Third_Reich) enacted by the Nazi Party deprived all Jews living within the Third Reich and occupied territories of possessing any kind of weapons, including knives, firearms, and ammunition.
1.4.4.3.10.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that an armed population would have made a difference in Nazi Germany. Jews made up [less than one percent](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005276) of the population; and the wider public supported the Nazi's repression and persecution of Jews.
1.4.4.3.10.4. Pro: During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, private firearms were [confiscated and transferred](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/F-Working-papers/SAS-WP4-Cambodia.pdf) to the stockpiles of the regime, which went on to kill between 1.5 and 3 million Cambodians.
1.4.4.3.10.5. Con: Plenty of other governments heavily restricted gun ownership without turning against their population or becoming tyrannical. A government's gun policies are therefore no bellwether.
1.4.4.3.10.5.1. Pro: Gun regulation in Japan [has been described](http://www.guncite.com/journals/dkjgc.html) as "the most stringent in the democratic world", yet the country has been a stable democracy for decades.
1.4.4.3.10.5.2. Pro: Australia [significantly tightened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Agreement) gun regulations in 1996 and implemented a mandatory buyback program for some gun types. Yet the country has remained a stable democracy.
1.4.4.3.11. Con: Democracies have various constitutional and procedural safeguards against tyranny.
1.4.4.3.11.1. Pro: The checks and balances of the American political system ensure that no branch of government can become overtly powerful or even tyrannical.
1.4.4.3.11.1.1. Con: Those checks and balances over time have become frayed and blurred to where the original responsibilities and authorities overlap and conflict.
1.4.4.3.11.1.1.1. Pro: Executive orders now allow a president to create laws outside the legislative process.
1.4.4.3.11.1.1.2. Pro: The Internal Revenue Service \(IRS\) has targeted nonprofit groups for scrutiny based strictly [on their political leaning](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-conservative/justice-department-settles-with-conservative-groups-over-irs-scrutiny-idUSKBN1CV1TY).
1.4.4.3.11.1.2. Con: In 1941 the US government implemented [Japanese internment](https://www.britannica.com/event/Japanese-American-internment) which was, "the forced relocation by the U.S. government of thousands of Japanese Americans to detention camps".
1.4.4.3.11.2. Pro: Political parties have a gate-keeping function through which individuals entering the political process are scrutinized, socialized and - if necessary - stopped.
1.4.4.3.11.2.1. Con: The 2016 election proved that the gate-keeping functions of political parties cannot always stop the [most unsavory](https://news.gallup.com/poll/197231/trump-clinton-finish-historically-poor-images.aspx) candidates from obtaining the highest office. Trump's 61% unfavorable score is worst in presidential polling history while
Clinton's 52% unfavorable score is second-worst.
1.4.4.3.11.3. Con: Constitutional and procedural safeguards only counter the possibility of a domestic tyrant taking power peacefully. These safeguards do nothing to prevent violent coups or external invasion.
1.4.4.3.12. Con: Americans, even though they were well-armed, have failed repeatedly in the past to defend freedom when the door to tyranny was opened by their government.
1.4.4.3.12.1. Pro: More than 100.000 Japanese Americans were [incarcerated in camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) during World War 2. Armed Americans did not stand up against this government overreach and violation of rights.
1.4.4.3.12.1.1. Pro: The incarceration has been described as a [violation of numerous rights](http://online.sfsu.edu/jaintern/rightsviolated.html) of those affected, among them those protected by various parts of the Constitution and several Amendments.
1.4.4.3.12.1.2. Pro: Through the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 the US government [admitted that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans) the internment was driven by "race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership" and not by military necessity.
1.4.4.3.12.2. Pro: In fact, the right to bear arms [enabled Americans](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1465114) to protect the white tyranny over black people during the slavery era. The Amendment's history is intrinsically linked to the preservation of tyranny.
1.4.4.3.13. Con: Any example of armed citizens saving their democracy from tyranny does not support the Second Amendment if that country did not have an equivalent to the Second Amendment. Such an example would actually demonstrates that the Second Amendment is unnecessary in order to protect democracy from tyranny.
1.4.4.3.13.1. Con: An example of armed citizens fighting tyranny does support the text of the Second Amendment which states that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. Even if the example doesn't support the need for the Second Amendment itself to exist, such examples do support the need for the principles in the Second Amendment to exist.
1.4.4.3.14. Con: The right to bear arms is not a necessary condition to safeguard democracy and freedom. There are plenty of countries in which both were defended or even established by private citizens without arms.
1.4.4.3.14.1. Pro: The Second Amendment states a well regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. The amendment does not claim that the right to bear arms is necessary to safeguard democracy or necessary for any other purpose. The amendment merely states the right shall not be infringed.
1.4.4.3.14.2. Pro: In the DC v. Heller [decision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Decision), the Supreme Court ruled, the "individual right to possess a firearm" is "unconnected with service in a militia". Since it's the militia which is necessary to safeguard a free state, the right to arms is not directly connected to that purpose.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1. Con: The majority holding in Heller--which recognized an individual right to civilian gun ownership--was decided [improperly](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/07/29/dennis-henigan/heller-majority-wrong-unprincipled).
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1. Pro: DC v. Heller was an instance of inappropriate [judicial activism.](https://reason.com/2008/09/23/in-defense-of-judicial-activis/)
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.1. Pro: Judicial activism is inappropriate. A provision of law is an expression of the intention of the legislators and of their constituency. Courts cannot alter the meaning of the Constitution, they can only interpret how the rules promulgated by legislators would apply to our society today. If a provision is irrelevant today it can only be amended by Congress and the States or the People.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.2. Pro: One of the country's most [prominent](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1265118) conservative judges criticized the majority in Heller of being judicial activists over Heller.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Antonin Scalia](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/07/29/dennis-henigan/heller-majority-wrong-unprincipled)’s opinion enforced his own political views. The fact that the opinion aligns with his political stance demonstrates proof of a motive to rule improperly.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: A legal expert's political views are inseparable from and informed by their understanding of the law. Politics exist within the framework of legal governance rather than being at odds with the laws that define the bounds of regulation.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The Constitution and laws circumscribe the appropriate expression of political beliefs, not vice versa.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.2.2. Con: The four most prominent conservative judges in the US Judicial branch agreed with Scalia.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.3. Pro: Many well-regarded conservative judges were quick to criticize Heller as lacking two supposed hallmarks of judicial conservatism: [an unbiased review of the evidence about the meaning of the Second Amendment and, given ambiguity about that meaning, judicial restraint](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/justice-scalia-second-amendment-and-judicial-conservatives). Justice Scalia’s opinion, these judicial conservatives argued, deployed an unbalanced historical analysis, reached a questionable conclusion about a constitutional right, and failed to defer to the judgments of elected officials.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Conservative Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner agreed in equally stark terms, writing that Heller reflected not conservatism, but rather “freewheeling discretion strongly flavored with ideology.”
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4. Pro: Some of the Justices involved in Heller already have a track record of [violating their role as a fair and impartial arbiter](https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1Bpr4T5iVcC) of important and highly controversial national issues. This poses a direct challenge to the credibility of the Court and their ability to fairly adjudicate cases concerning politically contentious subject matter.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: The author and majority justices Scalia and Thomas joined the majority in Bush v. Gore \(2000\)
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: In Bush v Gore \(2000\) the majority justices [decided as they did because of the personal identity and political affiliation of the litigants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore#Accusation_of_partisanship_or_conflict_of_interest), shattering the public's trust in their judicial neutrality.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: On the eve of the election Justice O'Connor made a public statement that a Gore victory would be a personal disaster for her.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Justice Thomas's wife was so intimately involved in the Bush campaign that she was helping to draw up a list of Bush appointees more or less at the same time as her husband was adjudicating on whether the same man would become the next President.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Justice Scalia's son was working for the firm appointed by Bush to argue his case before the Supreme Court, the head of which was subsequently appointed as Solicitor-General.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.5. Pro: The Opinion in Heller seems to have betrayed Scalia's own prescribed method for judging cases.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: Justice Scalia--an expert in legal text interpretation who authored Heller--[wrote](https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Law-Interpretation-Legal-Texts/dp/031427555X) that if possible every word and every provision should be given effect. None should be ignored and none should needlessly be given interpretation that [causes it to have no consequence](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/A-Guide-to-Reading-Interpreting-and-Applying-Statutes-1.pdf).
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.5.2. Pro: Opinions where Scalia uses readings from the original founders are the paradigm of originalism. That contrasts significantly with Heller where his order strays from that pattern, which he had always said was the best option for interpreting a provision.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: A quarter of Scalia's opinion focuses on the post-1800 understandings of the Second Amendment, a significant departure from the Originalism that it [purports](https://prospect.org/article/justice-scalias-dueling-opinions) to embody.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.2. Pro: In Heller, Justice Scalia simply [discarded](https://prospect.org/article/justice-scalias-dueling-opinions) the key 1939 precedent of United States v. Miller, which rejected the individual rights theory of the Second Amendment in Heller.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.3. Pro: The tone and judicial methodology of Scalia's opinions seem to vary based on whether or not the party seeking redress is politically [privileged](https://prospect.org/article/justice-scalias-dueling-opinions).
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4. Pro: In Heller, Justice Scalia [contorted](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1422048) the original public understanding of the Second Amendment’s textual command into something neither the framers nor ratifiers would have recognized as their own handiwork.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.1. Pro: The majority's interpretation renders the first thirteen words of the Amendment of no effect. [The first principle of constitutional interpretation](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/07/29/dennis-henigan/heller-majority-wrong-unprincipled) is that the Constitution must be read to give effect to every word and that interpretations that render portions of its text “mere surplusage” must be avoided.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.5.1.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.2. Pro: In DC v. Heller, dissenting [Justice Stevens](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html) wrote, "the words 'the people' in the Second Amendment refer back to the object announced in the Amendment’s preamble. They remind us that it is the collective action of INDIVIDUALS HAVING A DUTY TO SERVE in the militia..." Stevens asserts "the people" excludes people "outside the context of service" but confirms the militia is all "individuals having a duty to serve."
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.1.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.6.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.5. Pro: Even though the author of Heller, Justice Scalia, claimed that originalism is the best judicial method he has authored [many](https://today.law.harvard.edu/in-inaugural-vaughan-lecture-scalia-defends-the-methodology-of-originalism/?redirect=1) opinions that do not include any references to historical legal understandings whatsoever. This entails that he is contradicting his own supposed doctrine.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.5.1. Pro: According to Justice Scalia originalism is the [best method](https://www.law.virginia.edu/news/2010_spr/scalia.htm) for judging. "But originalism does not invite him to make the law what he thinks it should be, nor does it permit him to distort history with impunity," he said. The honest originalist will sometimes or often reach results he does not personally favor."
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.6. Pro: Scalia's ruling often violate his own supposed ideal of judicial originalism. In one such case \([Chavez v. Martinez - 2003](https://today.law.harvard.edu/in-inaugural-vaughan-lecture-scalia-defends-the-methodology-of-originalism/?redirect=1)\) Scalia joined the majority opinion by Thomas in finding that the coercive questioning by police under the circumstances of the case was not a constitutional violation. The opinion didn't include any historical data despite lengthy debates on the topic by the founders.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.3.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.8. Pro: The [legitimacy](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/judges-and-politics-dont-mix) of the judicial branch rests entirely on its promise to be fair and impartial and if the public loses faith in that — if the public believes that judges are just politicians in robes — there’s no reason to respect judge’s opinions any more than the opinions of the real politicians representing the electorate.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.9. Pro: The decision was excessively [sweeping](https://www.scotusblog.com/2009/07/analysis-did-heller-say-too-much/) in its structure.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.9.1. Pro: The opinion included the precaution to other judges that “…nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons…” The need for such a warning shows that the Court's declaration of an individual right could be interpreted to have an impact far beyond what's reasonable.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.9.1.1. Con: A ban on felon firearms ownership is in keeping with the mission to provide a militia and the inability of felons to serve in the regular military. Felons are not considered to be trustworthy soldiers.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Like many civilian gun owners[felons will rarely carry a hundred pounds](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2018/03/an-army-officer-says-regulate-weapons-just-like-we-do-in-the-military/554816/) on their back for 20 miles or sit freezing in a foxhole for days on end.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.9.2. Pro: Judicial ‘[minimalism](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0951629813502709?journalCode=jtpa)’ holds that judges should rule narrowly because they lack the knowledge required to make general rules to govern unknown future circumstances.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.11. Pro: The author and majority justices Scalia and Thomas have a track record of unfairly compromising themselves in cases concerning politically contentious subject matter.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.4.1.
1.4.4.3.14.2.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.1.5.
1.4.4.3.14.3. Pro: No European country, nor Canada, have a provision like the 2nd Amendment.
1.4.4.3.14.4. Pro: In response to the perceived undermining of democracy, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans [took to the streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016–17_South_Korean_protests) in 2016 until President Park was impeached. She was later [prosecuted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea.html) for the abuse of power, bribery and various other charges.
1.4.4.3.14.5. Pro: The [Orange Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution) in Ukraine was a series of peaceful protests in response to the perception that democracy was undermined through rigged elections and corruption. The result was a re-vote that brought down the sitting government.
1.4.4.3.15. Con: Civilians are able to resist tyranny without arms, so it cannot be the right to bear arms which enables resistance.
1.4.4.3.15.1. Pro: Non-violent resistance has played a role in [various transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance) from authoritarianism towards democracy. Among the figureheads of this form of resistance are Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela.
1.4.4.3.15.1.1. Con: Non-violent resistance is an extremely slow redress of grievances, often taking generations, as in the above examples. Insurgencies can benefit the generation that starts them.
1.4.4.3.16. Pro: In the [Battle of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_%281946%29) the democracy of the town of Athens, Tennessee was saved from tyranny entirely by a group of armed civilians.
1.4.4.3.16.1. Con: The GI Government collapsed a year later and was replaced with a clique similar to the one they had been fighting against.
1.4.4.3.16.2. Con: The Federal government attempted to correct the perversion of democracy but were powerless to do so precisely due to the fact that Georgia had previously been in a state of rebellion against the national government.
1.4.4.4. Pro: The right to bear arms helps to repel foreign invasion or occupation.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: The [Warsaw Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising) of 1944 was made possible by the well armed Polish underground resistance movement.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.2.
1.4.4.4.3. Pro: In 1939, [Karel Pavlík](http://americaninprague.eu/history/Nazi-Germany.shtml) commanded a company of armed Czechoslovakian citizens \(the 12th machine-gun company of the 8th Infantry Regiment\) that fought against Nazi tyranny in the town of Místek. Even though that battle was lost, the resistance and allied forces eventually won the war, driving the Nazis out of Místek.
1.4.4.4.4. Pro: In 1941, retired lieutenant colonel [Napoleon Zervas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Zervas), while a civilian, organized a resistance group of Greek citizens. In 1942, Zervas' group began armed conflicts against Nazi tyranny. The resistance and allied forces eventually won the war, driving the Nazis out of Greece.
1.4.4.4.5. Pro: During WWII, over a million [STEN](http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/draw_pdf.php?filename=WW2_Sten_Gun_Article-.pdf) sub-machine guns were hastily manufactured and thousands were blindly air-dropped into Nazi occupied territories like Norway, to arm civilians fighting for freedom.
1.4.4.5. Pro: The right to bear arms helps to repel insurrections and coups that aim to overthrow the government.
1.4.4.5.1. Con: There are various examples for military coups that succeeded in countries with an armed population.
1.4.4.5.1.1. Pro: Pakistan has a [relatively well-armed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country) population yet underwent [several military coups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_coups_in_Pakistan#1999_coup) in the past decades.
1.4.4.5.1.2. Pro: The Yemeni population is among the [most-armed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country) in the world, yet the country experienced a [military coup in 2014/2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_takeover_in_Yemen).
1.4.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Armed citizens are only going to resist a coup that they are against. The coup in Yemen is part of a greater [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_takeover_in_Yemen) and social movement, not a unilateral military power grab, so the parent claim does not apply.
1.4.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.4.1.
1.4.4.5.3. Pro: The current total military strength of the US is [2.83 million](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america#manpower). However, the number of households with a gun is estimated to be around [50 million](https://gunculture2point0.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/how-many-households-in-america-today-have-guns/). Many households own more than one gun and there is [more than 1 gun for every person in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/?utm_term=.8321ac6f7e81). This means a military coup in the US could never succeed.
1.5. Con: Repealing the Amendment and enforcing the changes that would go hand in hand with that would not be easily implemented.
1.5.1. Pro: A repeal of the Second Amendment might provoke opposition by states which would then, for example, appeal this move before the Supreme Court.
1.5.2. Pro: Repealing the amendment would likely go hand in hand with a large-scale registration requirement for guns. This would be problematic to implement.
1.5.2.1. Pro: [Assault rifle registration laws have already failed in New York state](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2015/06/24/nearly-one-million-new-yorkers-didnt-register-their-assault-weapons/), illustrating just how unlikely a registration and confiscation scheme would be to succeed in any part of the country.
1.5.3. Pro: Repealing the Second Amendment would be very costly, and cause a lot of strife, largely to no end. The right is unalienable. It can not be taken away, only violated. People have the right to defend themselves, and will even if it is no longer stated.
1.6. Pro: The Second Amendment's precise meaning is too unclear for it to be of use.
1.6.1. Con: The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is very easy to understand if you read it in the context of other constitutional provisions and legislation that Congress [enacted](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8/clause-15%E2%80%9316) during the early years of the republic.
1.6.2. Con: The lack of clarity might be justification for revising the Second Amendment but doesn't support repealing the Second Amendment.
1.6.3. Con: If so, then the "pursuit" of "happiness" is also too poorly defined and nebulous to be considered valid.
1.6.3.1. Con: The phrase ‘the pursuit of happiness’ does not appear in the constitution. It’s from the Declaration of Independence, the legal substance of which separated us from Britain’s colonial empire but did not establish for this new country a body of laws.
1.6.4. Pro: The meaning of terms like "militia" has been [a subject of debate and disagreement](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/10/politics/what-does-the-second-amendment-actually-mean-trnd/index.html) - even among experts - for a long time.
1.6.4.1. Pro: In the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling from 2008, justices disagreed about whether the term "militia" refers to all male, able-bodies citizens within a certain age range \([Justice Scalia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html)\) or only to citizens doing service in a state-organized militia \([Justice Stevens](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html)\).
1.6.4.1.1. Con: In the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling, Justice Scalia and [Justice Stevens](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html) disagreed as to whether the "right to keep and bear arms to encompass use or ownership of weapons outside the context of service in a well-regulated militia." They expressed no disagreement whether the term "militia" referred to all citizens or not. The court has always recognized "the militia" to be all able-bodied citizens.
1.6.4.2. Con: There seems to be consensus among the Supreme Court upon the definition of the term, "militia".
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.4.2.
1.6.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.16.5.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Experts on the Second Amendment like Joyce Lee Malcolm argue that there is no agreement on what sort of militia the framers [had in mind](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=j4ZnFy3f8sAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+Keep+and+Bear+Arms:+The+Origins+of+an+Anglo-American+Right&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdrL2ywebbAhWBmJQKHXIuDPQQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=To%20Keep%20and%20Bear%20Arms%3A%20The%20Origins%20of%20an%20Anglo-American%20Right&f=false) \(p. 136\) and that the meaning of the term is "[by no means clear](http://www.constitution.org/mil/maltrad.htm)".
1.6.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.9.16.8.
1.6.5. Pro: In the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling from 2008, the Supreme Court [acknowledged](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/opinion.html) in its ruling "very different interpretations of the Amendment" among its members.
1.6.6. Con: While there is no consensus on the meaning of the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court interpretation has been very clear; gun ownership is an individual right.
1.6.6.1. Con: [Since District of Columbia v. Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Dissenting_opinions) was a 5-4 decision, it illustrates that there is no actual consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment. Even the justices could not agree on the meaning of the Second Amendment.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.
1.6.7. Pro: The Second Amendment has been described by scholars as producing an "amazing range of", "varying", "very different" and "competing interpretations" \([Lee Malcolm, p. 136](https://books.google.de/books?id=j4ZnFy3f8sAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+Keep+and+Bear+Arms:+The+Origins+of+an+Anglo-American+Right&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-rY2y5cHcAhXnBsAKHePCA_kQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&q=To%20Keep%20and%20Bear%20Arms%3A%20The%20Origins%20of%20an%20Anglo-American%20Right&f=false); [Beeman, p. 82](https://books.google.de/books?id=A4y1h_AbwC4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Penguin+Guide+to+the+United+States+Constitution:+A+Fully+Annotated&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjr38rX5sHcAhVLecAKHYddDnAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%3A%20A%20Fully%20Annotated&f=false); [Hudson, p. 55](https://books.google.de/books?id=MCy2zFfD6yYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Handy+Law+Answer+Book&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKxYLi5sHcAhUjBcAKHSQQB30Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Handy%20Law%20Answer%20Book&f=false); [Uviller/Merkel, p. 5](https://books.google.de/books?id=abAwWcOeFjkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Militia+and+the+Right+to+Arms,+or,+How+the+Second+Amendment+Fell+Silent&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS9JTu5sHcAhVGVsAKHdxsCAAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Militia%20and%20the%20Right%20to%20Arms%2C%20or%2C%20How%20the%20Second%20Amendment%20Fell%20Silent&f=false); [Harcourt, p. 145](https://books.google.de/books?id=xJIUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Guns,+Crime,+and+Punishment+in+America&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE8vv35sHcAhWJIMAKHWMjBScQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Guns%2C%20Crime%2C%20and%20Punishment%20in%20America&f=false)\).
1.6.8. Pro: The version of the Bill of Rights sent to the states to be ratified [contained an error](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/01/most-consequential-comma/426894/) that completely changes the literal context of the second amendment. It is entirely possible that, technically speaking, the exact second amendment text used today in the US constitution was never actually ratified by the states.
1.6.8.1. Pro: The amendment's use of [commas](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/opinion/16freedman.html?_r=0) makes it ambiguous as to whether the focus is on protecting militias or protecting every individual citizen's right to bear arms.
1.6.8.1.1. Con: Contemporaneous state constitutions and prior English law clearly demonstrate that the right to arms was viewed as individual at the time of the Bill of Right's drafting.
1.6.8.1.1.1. Pro: The [British Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Influence_of_the_English_Bill_of_Rights_of_1689) established the concept of the right to self defense among English citizens, including the American Colonists, a full century earlier.
1.6.8.1.1.2. Pro: The [Vermont constitution](https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state-archives/government-history/vermont-constitutions/1777-constitution.aspx), drafted in 1777, affirms the American belief that the right to arms is for individual defense.
1.6.8.1.2. Con: The supposed comma error does not effect the meaning of an individual's right to bear arms.
1.6.8.1.3. Con: The text of the 2A, was ratified by the several states with the commas in question, and thus is and was legally binding.  Whether Jefferson thought the commas ought to have been placed elsewhere or removed is moot.
1.6.9. Con: The First Amendment has also been debated for a long time. Many believe it protects hate speech and many believe it doesn't. Just because something is debated doesn't mean the whole thing should be banned.
1.7. Pro: The Second Amendment should be repealed because it is ineffective.
1.7.1. Con: The ineffectiveness of the Second Amendment is not reason enough to repeal it.
1.7.2. Con: If the 2nd Amendment were "ineffective", then it would not have been cited as the main argument by the plaintiff's lawyer and been the first point in the decision of the Supreme Court during [District of Columbia v. Heller](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html).
1.7.3. Pro: In practice, US citizens are already prohibited from owning the vast majority of military arms, from RPGs to tanks, jets, missiles, etc.
1.7.3.1. Con: Many items listed here are [not actually prohibited](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_II_weapons). They may be purchased if the purchaser acquires the appropriate license and pays a yearly tax.
1.7.3.2. Pro: It is [illegal](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/guide/atf-national-firearms-act-handbook-atf-p-53208/download) to transfer or possess a machine gun made after May 19, 1986.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: While it is true that it is illegal to transfer a fully automatic weapon that was manufactured after may 19,1986, it is completely legal to own and transfer fully automatic weapons made before May 19, 1986. Those weapons are highly prized and buying one legally is very expensive, but it can be done as long as the person passes the background check and has the $200 tax stamp for it or is a [Class 3 weapons dealer.](http://www.oldglorygunsandammo.com/nfa-class-iii-weapons/)
1.7.3.3. Con: The Second Amendment has no language suggesting any arms control. "Shall not be infringed" suggests the opposite.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: The Second Amendment clearly contemplates that gun ownership is connected to militia service. At the time of the founding, militias and their guns were often [closely regulated](https://theconversation.com/five-types-of-gun-laws-the-founding-fathers-loved-85364), including by requiring periodic musterings for militia members and inspections of their firearms.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Pro: At the time of the adoption of the Constitution, the states could regulate weapons, since the Bill of Rights didn’t apply to state action—hence states could censor the press, or have established religions paid for out of general taxes, or endorse slavery. But the post-Civil War amendments \(13th through 15th\) generalized the Bill of Rights and made it binding on state action just as it is on the Federal government; the case law is [unambiguous](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2018/03/the-case-against-gun-control-cont/554822/).
1.7.3.4. Con: Most of those arms are ineffective for resistance to tyranny by insurrectionists or self defense, because they are designed to be used in concert with other forces that provide defense - such as how modern tanks are [deployed](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/not-dead-yet-why-modern-tanks-will-still-dominate-battlefield-49327). The backbone of [successful insurgencies against technological armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War#Causes_of_withdrawal) are small arms.
1.8. Con: The Second Amendment secures a right - the right to bear arms - that is fundamental to America's social contract between government and citizens.
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.8.2. Con: The right to bear arms is not deeply fundamental to the relationships between Americans and their government.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.8.2.2. Pro: The Second Amendment does [not at all](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ii/the-reasonable-right-to-bear-arms-adam-winkler/interp/2) [curtail](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/) the legislature’s power to regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons.
1.8.2.3. Pro: The Second Amendment states that citizens who bear arms should be "well regulated". This should be interpreted to allow the government to, for example, [ban handguns](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZD1.html) in high-crime urban areas.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: The Second Amendment refers to how uninfringed access to weapons is necessary to equip a [well regulated](https://www.insidesources.com/well-regulated-really-mean/) militia.
1.8.2.3.1.1. Con: If the purpose of the access to firearms is that the militia be well-regulated, then such a provision doesn't justify the widespread ownership of guns that have no connection to militia service, for example, handguns in high-crime urban areas.
1.8.3. Pro: Repealing any Amendment from the actual Bill of Rights would set a dangerous precedent, deeming the most basic rights of a U.S. citizen reversible.
1.8.3.1. Con: There is precedent for repealing amendments based on public wishes as opinion evolves e.g. 21st amendment repealing the 18th during the prohibition. Evolution of thinking on gun control is no different, as the abilities of weapons are vastly superior now compared to when the amendment was first written.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: The technical capabilities of arms is irrelevant in that you’re still not justifying why an American’s right to defend themselves should be given up.
1.8.3.1.1.1. Con: This is a straw man argument. No-one is advocating for Americans to give up the right to defend themselves, this is not the purpose of the second amendment anyway.
1.8.3.1.1.1.1. Con: In [DC v. Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment ensures civilians can be armed for personal self defense. The Second Amendment bolsters the security of person.
1.8.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.
1.8.3.2. Con: This is a typical slippery slope argument. The US has repealed one amendment, prohibition, and that precedent has not since been followed. The rules for passing an amendment are such a high standard that repealing other amendments which protect basic freedoms is highly unlikely.
1.8.3.2.1. Con: This may be so, but the point remains that our Bill of Rights hasn't been amended. We'd take a pretty large risk by changing one of the original ten amendments. Our right to speak freely, refuse soldiers from barging into our homes, etc. might be the next targets for change.
1.8.4. Con: The 2nd Amendment is different from other provisions in the Bill of Rights, like the freedom of speech and religion, in that the founders felt that the 2nd Amendment required a preface in order to justify its existence.
1.8.4.1. Con: "[The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/)," is an explanatory clause before designating a search warrant system.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: The words “the right of the people to .... shall not be violated” is a command.
1.8.4.2. Con: The [Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/preamble) in general uses similar language right in the first sentence: "...in order to form a more perfect union...". The Bill of Rights is a part of the Constitution, written and ratified contemporarily with it.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: The Preamble is not part of the Bill of Rights.
1.8.4.3. Con: The so-called “militia clause” was not intended as explanatory or as a mere preface. It constitutes the essential core of the right that the framers designed the 2A to protect. Historians report that there was much debate over the placement of the words.
1.8.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.4.
1.8.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.6.1.
1.8.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.8.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.1.
1.8.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.11.
1.8.4.4. Pro: Rights like Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Speech, Freedom from the Quartering of Troops during Peacetime, Personal Privacy, etc., are so self-evident that the founders didn't need to preface them in order to justify or contextualize them.
1.8.4.5. Pro: "The framers and ratifiers apparently . . . \[chose\] explicitly to legislate the goal in terms of which the provision was to be [interpreted](https://books.google.com/books?id=WigxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT265&lpg=PT265&dq=he+framers+and+ratifiers+apparently+chose+explicitly+to+legislate+the+goal+in+terms+of+which+the+provision+was+to+be+interpreted.&source=bl&ots=5Fxum2KgG6&sig=ACfU3U1LcCWJXx5G7axxZD8_nHl9DCKaLQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi63Kb42fHjAhWRr54KHZsIC04Q6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=he%20framers%20and%20ratifiers%20apparently%20chose%20explicitly%20to%20legislate%20the%20goal%20in%20terms%20of%20which%20the%20provision%20was%20to%20be%20interpreted.&f=false)."
1.8.4.5.1. Pro: What is special about the Amendment is the inclusion of an opening clause -- a preamble, if you will -- that seems to set out its purpose. No similar clause is a part of any other Amendment
1.8.4.5.1.1. Pro: the nearly unique inclusion of a purposive preamble \[in the Second Amendment\] -- the only other such language appears in the copyright clause
1.8.4.6. Con: Each amendment in the Bill of Rights follows its own unique format. The Second Amendment isn't unusual in having distinct phrasing.
1.8.4.6.1. Pro: Some Rights are stated as rights of the people, others are stated as restrictions on specific governmental bodies, others are stated as general prohibitions. Some explain their rational, other simple state the prohibited act without context. Each amendment is unique in style, format and word choice to the point that a "preamble" is not a stand-out feature.
1.8.5. Con: The 2nd Amendment was designed not to protect a fundamental right but to prevent the need for a peacetime standing army.
1.8.5.1. Con: How does it prevent the need for a standing army? By ensuring the people have the means to defend against invasion, which would surely violate their fundamental rights to life, liberty and property.
1.8.6. Con: Because the Second Amendment wasn't taken serious and didn't attract much interest for the longest time, it can hardly be a fundamental part of America's social contract.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Interest in the Second Amendment was a reaction to a [handgun ban push started in the early '70s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Campaign). This was the first "shot fired" in what has become a major partisan issue in the US.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: The 1970's emergence of interest in the [Second Amendment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eya_k4P-iEo) was caused by a major propaganda effort undertaken by the NRA on behalf of the private [financial profit](http://vpc.org/studies/bloodmoney.pdf) motives of [gun](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2015-10-07/how-the-gun-lobby-rewrote-the-second-amendment) [manufacturers](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/nra-second-amendment-guns-violence).
1.8.6.2. Pro: The "[burgeoning](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=7254&context=ylj)" interest in the Second Amendment is a relatively recent phenomenon. Legal scholars traditionally didn't hold the provision in very high regard. As recently as 1989 a professor stated "the second amendment is not taken seriously by most scholars."
1.8.6.3. Con: A right taken for granted only receives notice once it is infringed upon.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: No one talks about the [Third Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), but citizens would be rightfully upset if the military started requisitioning their homes.
1.8.6.4. Con: This is an [appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) \(the "thesis is deemed correct on the basis of correlation with past or present [tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition)"\) built upon a [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens) \("didn't attract much interest" isn't equivalent to "not be fundamental", it can show that everyone accepted the Second Amendment, which is the root of your appeal to tradition\) and in such a context it seems a fallacy to me.
1.8.7. Pro: None of the original ten amendments has ever been repealed or changed, and we should not start now. Those original ten amendments were created by those who founded this great nation, for very good reasons.
1.8.8. Pro: [Justice Stevens writes](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/dissent.html), the Second Amendment contains "both a duty and a right to have arms". The amendment is not just about a right but it also serves to "remind us that it is the collective action of individuals having a duty to serve in the militia". Repealing the Second Amendment would eliminate that reminder of the peoples' duty to serve.
1.8.8.1. Con: The second amendment does not imply a duty. It states that a well-regulated militia is necessary to protect the nation. That is not a requirement to 1\) serve or 2\) own weapons.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.8.5.
1.8.10. Con: Following [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#John_Locke's_Second_Treatise_of_Government_\(1689\)), the social contract stipulates that people respect and obey the government in exchange for safety and prosperity. The Second Amendment undermines this social contract as it makes America unsafe.
1.8.10.1. Pro: The Second Amendment and the right it protects enables much violence in the US.
1.8.10.1.1. Con: Most of this violence emanates from criminals who probably don't care about legislation anyway.
1.8.10.1.1.1. Pro: Responsible citizens should not lose protection of their rights due to the actions of criminals.
1.8.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Advocating for a right that is attributed to the [death or injury of thousands of children](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gun-violence-children-america-us-study-deaths-injuries-statistics-a7797621.html) every year is not responsible.
1.8.10.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The right referred to is the right of self defense. No murders can be attributed to self defense.
1.8.10.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Vehicles and pools have been attributed to many deaths and injury as well, but they are not regulated in the same way.
1.8.10.1.1.1.2. Con: A law cannot create or revoke rights. Repealing the Second Amendment would not make gun ownership illegal.
1.8.10.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The 13th Amendment revoked the right to own slaves. The 15th Amendment revoked the right to discriminate by race. The 18th Amendment revoked the right to own alcohol. Several rights have been revoked by law.
1.8.10.1.1.1.3. Con: What is the point of law, but to create order. All manner of law is written to protect freedoms or prevent crime. Therefore, if arms are used in the commission of crime, law will follow to protect citizens.
1.8.10.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The basic freedoms that all citizens are endowed with are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \(aka property\). If guns pose a threat to life, then laws can be passed to protect your right to life.
1.8.10.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Violent crime is already against the law, and always has been. But guns are a tool of both defense from violent crime and the means of enforcing those laws.
1.8.10.1.1.1.4. Con: It is not necessarily penalizing to be barred from purchuasing things. In some cases, it is protection. For instance, you are not allowed to buy crystal meth.
1.8.10.1.1.1.4.1. Con: It would offer far more protection for users if they were permitted to [legally purchase drugs](https://www.projectknow.com/the-case-for-legalizing-drugs/). There would be no violent black market, quality would be much higher, professionals could monitor use, and treatment wouldn't carry as large of a stigma.
1.8.10.1.1.1.4.2. Con: If drugs were not criminalized, there would be far less crime in the country, including gun crime. Many robberies, burglaries, assaults, and homicides [are drug and/or gang related](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/246404.pdf).
1.8.10.1.2. Con: Constitutional rights can be limited; therefore, fairly strict regulations can be imposed on the sale of firearms without outright repealing the Second Amendment.
1.8.10.1.3. Pro: The Second Amendment [makes it impossible](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/#tab-opinion-1962736) for the government to enact gun regulations in order to deter crimes, prevent accidents, and promote other causes related to the public interest.
1.8.10.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.2.2.
1.8.10.1.3.2. Pro: In the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. [Heller](https://www.thegazette.com/2010/07/06/judicial-restraint-or-judicial-activism-its-how-you-look-at-it), the court first recognized private citizens had rights to own firearms entitled to protection from federal law under the Second Amendment. In McDonald v. Chicago \(2010\), they held the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment protection of the right to keep and bear arms applicable to the states.
1.8.10.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.
1.8.10.1.3.3. Pro: The Second Amendment has an enormous symbolic value that makes it difficult to enact any legislation that goes against what could be perceived as violating its spirit.
1.8.10.1.3.3.1. Con: The second amendment still allows for a lot of gun control so its repeal is not the solution for the American gun violence problem.
1.8.10.1.3.3.2. Pro: The meaning of the Second Amendment in the context of the Constitution [has been described](https://journals.openedition.org/ejas/12179) as one of "sacred political inheritance" that demands "religious adherence".
1.8.10.1.3.3.2.1. Con: The article notes that all of the Constitution and Bill of Rights is enshrined in a similar reverence. First Amendment issues receive an even more expansive and emotional examination than the Second.
1.8.10.1.3.3.2.2. Con: The Second Amendment doesn't effectively receive "religious adherence" as many [modern gun control initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States) were put in place by [conservatives](https://www.thoughtco.com/gun-rights-under-president-ronald-reagan-721343) - most recently a ban on bump stocks by [Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_fire).
1.8.10.1.3.3.3. Pro: Through a decades-long campaign by organizations such as the NRA, the Amendment has become [a marker of political and cultural identity](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16418524/nra-second-amendment-guns-violence), especially on the right. This makes a calm debate about gun legislation largely impossible.
1.8.10.1.3.3.3.1. Con: The [Federal Assault Weapons Ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban) portion of the 1994 Crime Bill was debated and coordinated between conservatives, liberals and the NRA, nearly 20 years after the NRA started its efforts to counter liberal gun control movements of the [early 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Campaign#History).
1.8.10.1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: To counter the anti-gun lobbying groups of the early 1970s, the NRA established its own lobby arm in [1975](https://www.nraila.org/about/) to preserve the individual right to gun ownership.
1.8.10.1.4. Pro: Places with more guns have more [homicides](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000500/gun-homicide-place).
1.8.10.1.5. Pro: The Second Amendment contributes to the false perception that armed civilians have the authority to use violent force to [confront alien migrants](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/u-s-mexico-border-isn-t-protected-militias-it-s-ncna997056) at the border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said they [do not endorse](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Anti-government-citizen-militia-groups-want-to-5604303.php) or support any private group or organization from taking matters into their own hands as it could have disastrous personal and public safety consequences."
1.8.10.1.5.1. Pro: The New Mexico attorney general’s office announced that Larry Hopkins, the leader of the United Constitutional Patriots \(which had been detaining migrants at gunpoint near the U.S.-Mexico border\) had been arrested by the FBI and charged with felony possession of firearms and ammunition
1.8.10.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.7.
1.8.10.1.7. Con: More people are killed in car accidents than by a gun. More than twice the amount of people are killed by [alcohol](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics) than by guns every year. Even more are killed by tobacco, yet there is no call to ban any of those.
1.8.10.1.7.1. Con: Sales of alcohol and tobacco can legally be restricted, and car ownership subject to licensing, background checks and assessments of competency, unlike guns.
1.8.10.1.7.1.1. Con: The ownership of firearms IS legally restricted and subject to licencing and background checks.
1.8.10.1.7.2. Con: Campaigns for the stricter regulation or even banning of tobacco products have a history that spans decades.
1.8.10.1.7.3. Con: The number of traffic deaths has been [steadily sinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year#/media/File:US_traffic_deaths_per_VMT,_VMT,_per_capita,_and_total_annual_deaths.png) for decades thanks for increasing safety standards and regulation. The issue of traffic deaths is therefore successfully being dealt with whereas the [number of handgun homicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Ushomicidesbyweapon.svg) is on the same level as in the 1970s and 1980s \(although it has been higher since then\).
1.8.10.1.7.3.1. Con: A [more comprehensive look](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/) shows that both crime and gun homicides have decreased significantly since the 1970s and 1980s.
1.8.10.1.8. Pro: There is a correlation between gun ownership rates and gun violence and gun deaths.
1.8.10.1.8.1. Con: By observing the higher intentional homicide rates in other countries, we can see the negative effects of restrictive gun laws.
1.8.10.1.8.1.1. Pro: [According to the UN](http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf), the countries with the highest intentional homicide rates are; #1-El-Salvador \(82.84\), #2-Honduras \(56.52\) and #3-Venezuela \(56.33\). By comparison to those countries, the US has very lax gun control laws and an intentional homicide rate of 5.25 per 100,000 which puts the US at #87 on the list. [El Salvador](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/el-salvador) [Honduras](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/honduras) [Venezuela](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/venezuela)
1.8.10.1.8.2. Pro: Long term studies in the US indicate that rates of gun ownership and firearm homicide rates [rise in tandem.](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409?journalCode=ajph)
1.8.10.1.8.3. Pro: Across US states, those with higher rates of gun ownership in general also have [higher rates of gun deaths](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/pro-gun-myths-fact-check/).
1.8.10.1.8.4. Pro: Research comparing US states with each other points towards an [inverse correlation](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/) of gun control - for examples assault weapons bans and trigger lock requirements - and gun deaths.
1.8.10.1.8.4.1. Con: All American states are subject to the provisions of the Second Amendment. These gun control measures can apparently be implemented without violating the Second Amendment. Thus, lower rates of gun deaths and the existence of the Second Amendment do not exclude each other.
1.8.10.1.8.5. Con: The correlation might run both ways or even the other way though. High rates of violence and gun deaths might motivate people to buy more guns, as [has been argued](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/supplementary/firearm-prevalence-violent-crime.html).
1.8.10.1.9. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment is unlikely to change the prevalence of gun violence in the US as the weapons used for this violence are already out there.
1.8.10.1.9.1. Con: There are various examples for gun buyback programs through which the number of guns was reduced, for example [in Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_buyback_program#Australia) between 1996 and 2003.
1.8.10.1.9.2. Con: Over time, those guns will fall apart and need to be repaired. Without a place to repair them, they will become useless.
1.8.10.1.10. Con: The Second Amendment doesn't prevent states from restricting [gun access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States) \(the "violence" mentioned in the parent\), as evidenced by [various laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state).
1.8.10.1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.8.5.1.
1.8.10.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.4.1.
1.8.10.1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.3.
1.8.10.1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.14.2.1.
1.8.10.1.10.5. Pro: Gun control is as much a part of the Second Amendment as the right to [keep and bear arms](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ii/the-reasonable-right-to-bear-arms-adam-winkler/interp/2).
1.8.10.1.10.6. Pro: It's not the Second Amendment that's caused the gun violence--it's the mis-interpretation and willful distortion of the provision's intent--that's enabled such reckless gun policies.
1.8.10.1.10.7. Pro: The Second Amendment does not allow the right to bear ammunition. States could outlaw the [sale](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-should-regulate-bullets/2016/01/06/62de9322-b3dc-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html?utm_term=.8872e5486fed) and [possession](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/no-really-regulate-the-bullets/266332/) of bullets without repealing the amendment.
1.8.10.1.10.7.1. Con: Banning ammunition would be unconstitutional for at least one of two reasons. First, [ammunition](http://www.constitution.org/leglrkba.htm) is generally considered to be "arms". Second, even if ammunition is not considered to be arms such a ban would still be an infringement on the right to "bear arms". The government cannot restrict piecemeal what the Constitution forbids them to restrict wholesale.
1.8.10.1.10.7.2. Con: The opinions expressed in the Washington Post and The Atlantic do not seem to have any legal basis. There's no legal precedence or legal argument which suggests the Second Amendment does not protect ammunition.
1.8.10.1.10.8. Pro: Various rulings of federal courts, as well as decisions by the Supreme Court to not overrule them, have clarified that bans on assault rifles, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines [can be mandated](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/are-recently-proposed-gun-regulations-constitutional) in accordance with the Second Amendment.
1.8.10.1.11. Con: There is an assumption with this statement that gun control laws prevent violence. This is unsupported.
1.8.10.1.11.1. Con: This is not unsupported. The experience with comparatively affluent nations with similar demographic backgrounds who have enacted stricter gun control policies have shown [decreases in gun violence and deaths](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/4/16418754/gun-control-washington-post).
1.8.10.1.12. Pro: America suffers from more and worse mass shootings than other countries.
1.8.10.1.12.1. Con: Mass shootings aren't a product of the Second Amendment and occur in countries with much more gun control. There is a correlation being implied that is not explained.
1.8.10.1.12.2. Pro: A third of all mass shootings with a minimum of four victims between 1966 and 2012 took place in the US and led, on average, to more victims than elsewhere \([Lankford, p. 176](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/scimag/10.1080%2F01924036.2015.1105144)\).
1.8.10.1.12.2.1. Con: Research in response to the study [points to](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3238736) a far larger share of shootings in countries besides the US. Based on this data, the US accounts for only 1.4% of mass shootings \(while accounting for 4% of the world's population\).
1.8.10.1.12.2.1.1. Con: The study by John Lott compares data from the United States with war- and insurgency-torn regions like the Middle East, Central America and Russia. A closer look at Lott's study shows that the US has ten times as many mass shootings per capita as Canada, and five times as many per capita as the UK, regions that are more culturally and economically similar to the US.
1.8.10.1.12.2.2. Con: Lankford's data selection is questionable, for example because he focused exclusively on shootings with a single perpetrator.
1.8.10.1.12.2.2.1. Pro: According to Lankford, Columbine wasn't a mass shooting, since it had [more than one assailant](https://econjwatch.org/articles/confirmation-that-the-united-states-has-six-times-its-global-share-of-public-mass-shooters-courtesy-of-lott-and-moody-s-data).
1.8.10.1.12.2.3. Pro: The study emphasizes that America's lax gun regulations allow perpetrators to acquire multiple guns which commonly increases the number of victims \([Lankford, p. 180](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01924036.2015.1105144?needAccess=true)\).
1.8.10.1.12.2.4. Pro: In similar research that spans the same time period and a total of 171 countries, 90 mass shootings took place in the US. Only four other countries reached double-digits: The Philippines, Russia, Yemen and France, none of which had more than 18 mass shootings \([Lankford, p. 192](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1797309887?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo)\).
1.8.10.1.12.3. Pro: The United States has a [far higher rate of gun homicides](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/compare-these-gun-death-rates-the-us-is-in-a-different-world.html) than other rich Western countries, even when adjusted for differences in population size.
1.8.10.1.12.3.1. Con: The US homicide rate is much greater than countries with similar levels of gun control, like [Austria](https://money.cnn.com/2015/12/07/news/gun-control-australia-uk-austria-switzerland-canada/index.html), suggesting that gun control has nothing to do with violence.
1.8.10.1.12.3.2. Pro: America's gun homicide rate is [25 times as high](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343\(15\)01030-X/pdf) as that of other populous, high-income countries. For 15- to 24-year olds, it is even 49 times as high.
1.8.10.1.12.3.3. Con: A [true representation](https://mises.org/wire/mistake-only-comparing-us-murder-rates-developed-countries) of homicide statistics should include all homicides in all countries, not just gun-related homicides or just "populous, high-income countries".
1.8.10.1.12.3.4. Pro: Some countries where gun ownership is illegal have a [rate of less than 1 homicide per 100 000 inhabitants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate). That rate in the USA is of 5.35 per 100 000, higher than in most of the developed countries.
1.8.10.1.12.3.4.1. Con: [Austria has a murder rate of .6 per 100,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Austria#Murder) with more [lenient gun laws](https://money.cnn.com/2015/12/07/news/gun-control-australia-uk-austria-switzerland-canada/index.html) than the US, demonstrating that gun control has nothing to do with murder rates. Switzerland and several other European countries provide similar examples.
1.8.10.1.13. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment will not solve the issue of violence in the US or even lessen it by an extremely large degree. If you take away one of many methods of causing harm and pain, there are still many other methods available.
1.8.10.1.13.1. Con: This opinion is not supported by international experience with gun control \(vis. [Australia](http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/GunBuyback_Panel.pdf), [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/firearms-act-twenty-years-on-has-it-made-a-difference-dunblane-port-arthur-a8110911.html)\). Countries with largely similar cultural backgrounds and values to the USA have instituted gun control measures with a subsequent decrease in firearm related homicides and suicides.
1.8.10.1.13.2. Pro: Tools of violence, in fact, can be an effective deterrent of violence.
1.8.10.1.13.2.1. Pro: The concept of [Mutually Assured Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) has helped prevent the outbreak of global war in the nuclear age.
1.8.10.1.13.3. Pro: [In April 2018 the murder rate in London surpassed the murder rate in New York for the first time.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/03/londons-murder-rate-higher-than-new-york-citys/480860002/) Britain has no constitutional protections for firearms, and has very strict gun control.
1.8.10.1.13.3.1. Con: This data is unlikely to be representative of a larger trend and merely points towards exceptional months. In 2017 in total, New York City had [almost three times](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43628494) as many murders as London. The differences in the ten years prior to that were even more pronounced.
1.8.10.1.13.3.2. Con: New York is hardly representative for the rate of gun violence in the US as a whole. Dozens of major US cities have [much higher murder rates](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/) then New York.
1.8.10.1.13.4. Con: Firearms are one of the easiest and most effective ways to kill. You only have to pull a trigger. Banning this killing method will make it harder for someone to commit a crime, and that may discourage them from doing so.
1.8.10.1.13.5. Pro: In some Asian countries with strict gun laws, deadly [knife attacks](https://bigthink.com/dragons-and-pandas/years-of-the-knife-nil-the-stabbing-culture-in-east-asia) are common.
1.8.10.1.13.5.1. Con: All of these attacks would have been more deadly if the attackers had used a gun.
1.8.10.1.13.6. Con: Repealing the second amendment will not eliminate all violence, but mitigating some of it is still a worthwhile endeavor.
1.8.10.1.13.6.1. Con: Changing the tool used to do violence does not mitigate violence.
1.8.10.1.13.6.1.1. Con: It does when the new tool is significantly less effective at causing harm, and this is the case with guns compared to other weapons.
1.8.10.1.13.7. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.8.10.1.14. Con: The majority of firearm crimes are committed by those that [illegally possess firearms](http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/mar/12/john-faso/do-illegal-gun-owners-commit-most-gun-crime-rep-fa/). Therefore, repealing the Second Amendment would specifically target legal firearms owners without providing a response to those that illegally possess firearms and the violence caused by them.
1.8.10.1.14.1. Con: Prohibition of guns would reduce the amount of guns in circulation. The illegal gun markets would also fall apart.
1.8.10.1.14.1.1. Con: With [393 million private guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_ownership) in the US and [widespread non-compliance with gun restrictions](https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2016/07/07/massive-noncompliance-with-safe-act/), the banning of legal firearms would likely flood the illegal market as former legal owners attempt to recoup their costs.
1.8.10.1.14.1.2. Con: Prohibition of any good [drives demand for a black market solution to supply what the open market does not](http://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-85-number-5/globalization-us-black-market-prohibition-war-drugs-and-case-mexico).
1.8.10.1.14.1.2.1. Con: Unlike some other illegal products, gun production requires more technologies and machines. It makes it more difficult to produce illegal guns.
1.8.10.1.14.1.2.1.1. Con: Anyone with $500-$1,000 can reliably manufacture firearms on their own with [devices like the GhostGunner](https://ghostgunner.net/collections/featured-products/products/ghost-gunner-2-deposit) or any other [CNC milling machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control). This is comparable in price and complication to the stills of alcohol prohibition and grow setups for illegal marijuana cultivation.
1.8.10.1.14.1.3. Con: Illegal gun markets would probably become more prevalent, as eliminating the private supply of guns would be next to impossible. There are inherent logical problems in enacting such legislation when [more guns are owned privately than by law enforcement](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2017/08/robert-farago/trace-civilians-70-times-guns-u-s-police-military-combined/).
1.8.10.1.14.1.3.1. Con: This is exactly why it should not be made possible that citizens own more guns than law enforcement.
1.8.10.1.14.1.3.2. Con: If it was illegal to sell guns to citizens, the gun factories would dramatically reduce their production. Less supply means less illegal sales.
1.8.10.1.14.1.3.2.1. Con: [Illegal sales largely take place between individuals](https://gun.laws.com/illegal-guns/illegal-guns-statistics), not between firearms manufacturers and individuals. Restricting the legality of manufacturing does not solve the problem of the private trade and sale of already owned weapons, [as Australia has found out](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/78dxzg/we-asked-australians-where-they-got-their-illegal-guns).
1.8.10.1.14.1.4. Con: Prohibition of illicit drugs has not caused the illegal drug market to "fall apart".
1.8.10.1.15. Pro: Guns make it easier to inflict serious damage and kill than other legally available weapons. Although they can be used for defensive purposes, too, the Second Amendment therefore enables violence that might otherwise not occur.
1.8.10.1.15.1. Con: If there can be deadly crimes without firearms, then it's not good enough to advocate removal of means of self-defense as a mechanism of safer society since firearms also make a very effective self-defense mechanism.
1.8.10.1.15.2. Con: The Second Amendment enables legal protections for individual rights. It does not enable or disable violence.
1.8.10.1.15.2.1. Con: It is possible that the Second Amendment protects rights and enables violence at the same time.
1.8.10.1.16. Con: [According to the CDC](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/chapter-2-firearm-deaths/), firearm homicides peaked in 1993 at 7 per 100,000. [As of 2015, it was at 4 per 100,000](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm). However, the number of guns in the US has risen dramatically from 173 million in 1981 to [393 million](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf) in 2018. If the parent claim was true, we should have seen a drastic increase in the gun related homicides rate, not a lower rate.
1.8.10.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.1.1.
1.8.10.3. Con: [Locke argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract#John_Locke's_Second_Treatise_of_Government_\(1689\)) that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence \(reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"\). The Second Amendment protects the right of self-defense.
1.8.10.3.1. Con: For Locke, the right to self-defense is only a means to an end: security. If other means, such as gun legislation, are more effective at reaching this goal, they don't violate individuals' inalienable rights \([Heyman, p. 246](https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3292&context=cklawreview)\).
1.8.10.4. Pro: In terms of safety, America lags behind other nations of comparable wealth.
1.8.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.1.12.3.
1.8.10.4.2. Pro: The homicide rate in the US is [about 30% higher](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI) than the average of OECD nations and far ahead of that in countries with a comparable level of wealth.
1.8.10.4.3. Con: America's wealth may be comparable to that of other nations in some regards, but it has [the highest inequality among industrial nations](https://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm). It should therefore not be compared to them.
1.8.10.5. Pro: Locke's arguments are of relevance in this context since they influenced the founding fathers and the way they setup the legal foundations of the United States.
1.8.10.5.1. Pro: Locke's ideas and writings, and especially his conception of natural rights and the social contract, were of "tremendous influence on the constitutional framers" and shaped the Bill of Rights \([Grigsby, p. 502](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=f7m713xwK58C&pg=PA502&lpg=PA502&dq="were+of+tremendous+influence+on+the+constitutional+framers"&source=bl&ots=JvmpFyRoSD&sig=ACfU3U0-yyNRvR3tXguq4gGOA0s-OxpYlA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwil35TFxIXhAhUEvrwKHb9qDWsQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q="were%20of%20tremendous%20influence%20on%20the%20constitutional%20framers"&f=false), [Doernberg, p. 57](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2069&context=californialawreview)\).
1.8.10.5.2. Pro: Due to the influence of Locke's philosophy on the constitutional setup of the US, the label of a "Lockean nation" \(as quoted in [Suess. p. 368](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&context=law_jurisprudence)\) has been used by some academics.
1.8.11. Con: The right protected by the Second Amendment clashes with other, more fundamental rights and interests.
1.8.11.1. Pro: Article 3 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) affirms every person's "right to life, liberty and security of person".
1.8.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.1.
1.8.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.1.1.
1.8.11.1.3. Pro: As the comparison with other high-income countries shows, safety in the US is relatively low. American men are nine times as likely to be a homicide victim than men in other OECD countries, women four times as likely as women in other OECD countries \([Grinshteyn/Hemenway, p. 270/1](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2815%2901030-X/abstract)\)
1.8.11.2. Pro: The [letter of transmittal](http://constitutionus.com) that accompanied the draft of the constitution described "prosperity, felicity, safety" as the purpose of "the consolidation of our Union". The Second Amendment undermines the safety of Americans.
1.8.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.1.
1.8.11.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.1.1.1.
1.8.11.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.11.1.3.
1.8.11.3. Con: The right protected by the Second Amendment helps provide for "the security of a free state" which is one of the more fundamental rights and interests of the nation.
1.8.11.3.1. Con: Living in a country where anyone around you may own a gun is not really a secure situation as defined by a 'state of being free from danger or threat', because guns make crimes more likely to happen. A country where no civilian owns a gun is therefore much more secure.
1.8.11.3.1.1. Con: While some may trade freedom for security, America has typically sided with freedom.
1.8.11.3.1.1.1. Con: When a violent person owns a gun, he is more likely to hurt or kill more people than he would without a gun. This breaks the fundamental freedom of living for the victims.
1.8.11.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The breaking of the law \(murder\) does not infringe on rights because it is already illegal.
1.8.11.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That it is illegal doesn't mean that it won't happen. Justice is done after a crime is committed, but that won't save the victim.
1.8.11.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Crime breaks the freedom of living, beyond the scope of laws and legal rights.
1.8.11.3.1.2. Con: There is no state truely free from danger or threat.
1.8.11.3.1.2.1. Con: While we can't truly be free from danger or threat, we should take any reasonable action that would get us as close as possible to this state.
1.8.11.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.1.12.3.4.
1.9. Con: The Second Amendment protects the Militias of the states from the Federal government. Since there are no Militias, the Second Amendment is an anachronism that need not be repealed.
1.9.1. Con: The Second Amendment, while a relic of a past time, is often misinterpreted and misapplied. As such, it should be repealed anyway as it would halt this practice and have significant symbolic value.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.8.10.1.
1.11. Pro: The Second Amendment has racist origins.
1.11.1. Con: Modern opposition to gun control owes it's origins to the [Civil Rights Movement](https://www.dukeupress.edu/this-nonviolent-stuffll-get-you-killed) and the [Black Panthers](http://time.com/4431356/nra-gun-control-history/) for promoting the idea that freedoms can only be won if there was the ability to defend oneself.
1.11.2. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment would allow for greater gun control, which [has historically been used](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/gun-control-racist-present-171006135904199.html) in a racist context to disarm people of color.
1.11.3. Pro: The Second Amendment was written and introduced in the [historical](https://newrepublic.com/article/146190/brutal-origins-gun-rights) [context](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/02/22/what-the-second-amendment-really-meant-to-the-founders/?utm_term=.38c9d96c0149) of gun legislation that was meant to protect the dominance of white men, for example over native and black Americans. The history of the amendment is therefore entangled with that of racism in the US.
1.11.3.1. Con: A slave revolt was only one such scenario though. The British returning was not quite an unfounded fear during the drafting period, as demonstrated by the War of 1812.
1.11.4. Pro: At the time of the writing of the Bill of Rights, the [historical meaning](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/02/22/what-the-second-amendment-really-meant-to-the-founders/?utm_term=.38c9d96c0149) that was implied by the words "right to bear arms" was specifically to the exclusion of African Americans and other oppressed peoples like Native Americans.
1.11.4.1. Con: The Second Amendment did not discriminate by race but applied to all free people, hence "free negroes" benefited from it, and local laws of the time conformed to this concept.
1.11.5. Con: Just because something has its origins in the slavery era and was based on racism does not mean that it should be abandoned. Many things overcome their origins and are today of independent value.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Both the White House and the Capitol building were built [with the help of slaves](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/questions/did-slaves-build-the-white-house) and on the basis of American racism. Yet there is no debate about tearing them down.
1.11.6. Con: The lawful interpretation of the 2nd Amendment is not racist, so its origins have no effect on the merit of the amendment.
1.11.6.1. Con: Originalists, justices who argue alongside the original intent of the amendments, tend to lean towards [conservative values](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/01/neil-gorsuch-antonin-scalia-and-originalism-explained/?utm_term=.576d650bc276) \(i.e. supporting the full powers of the second amendment\). Because the justices who support this amendment use arguments based on original intent, a racist original intent to the amendment would be relevant.
1.11.7. Con: The [origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) of the Second Amendment lie in the British Bill of Rights, and therefore in the ambition to allow white people to defend themselves against other white people, not in some racist endeavor.
1.12. Con: Gun ownership is a fundamental part of being an American.
1.12.1. Pro: Hunting and sports involving guns are an essential and popular part of American culture.
1.12.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.4.
1.12.1.3. Con: Hunting is going out of fashion. Between 2011 and 2016, the number of Americans who hunt declined [by about two million](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/new-5-year-report-shows-1016-million-americans-participated-hunting-fishing-wildlife) to about 11 million.
1.12.2. Con: What it means to be American is not fixed and is always evolving. An America without the Second Amendment is therefore by no means impossible or unimaginable.
1.12.2.1. Pro: It was a fundamental part of being an American to be able to drink alcohol until the 18th Amendment, then it wasn't, then it was again after the passing of the 21st Amendment. The same could happen for the 2nd Amendment - it could be repealed, and not owning a gun would be part of the national identity of "Being an American".
1.12.2.2. Con: Just because something can be imagined does not mean it is good.
1.12.3. Con: Irrelevant. See, for example, the 1939 Miller decision \(e.g., [www.law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/307/174)\). The Second Amendment addresses the expectation that the militia \(an institution in each state\) shall be free from interference from the federal government. The Miller decision reversed a lower court ruling because without "reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument."
1.12.3.1. Con: The Second Amendment is an individual right, not limited to the militia. See the Heller decision. "The [Second Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentii) is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its operative clause. The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose."
1.12.4. Con: There is a tradition of gun ownership, but a larger number of Americans [do not own guns](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249740/percentage-of-households-in-the-united-states-owning-a-firearm/). To claim that gun ownership is fundamental to being an American excludes the majority of Americans.
1.12.4.1. Con: What is part of being an American is the freedom to buy and own guns, not necessarily the actual ownership.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: The freedom to buy/own guns is only part of being American for some people right now because it is currently legal. The fact that something is currently legal is not an argument to keep it legal.
1.12.5. Pro: Gun ownership is a way for Americans to feel connected to the nation's historical roots, since firearms played an important role in the creation of the country as it is known today.
1.12.5.1. Con: To claim that elements of America's past are worth preserving because it keeps people connected to the nation's roots is problematic. By the same logic, the continuation of racism could be justified.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The British attempt to confiscate firearms and gunpowder from the Colonists was a [key catalyzing factor](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1967702) in the American Revolution; and without their firearms, it is unlikely that the Colonies would have ever won the war and gained their independence from Great Britain.
1.12.5.3. Pro: Firearms were an essential element of Manifest Destiny and westward expansion.
1.12.5.3.1. Pro: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [Native American gun trade](https://books.google.com/books?id=BJRJZZIxrmkC&pg=PR8&lpg=PR8&dq=the+role+of+guns+in+westward+expansion&source=bl&ots=XvgOw2z1gQ&sig=a-iacedXqyNM6skP_3YVCrjaeiU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWiKOjpu_bAhXPqFkKHV9wDos4ChDoAQhTMAo#v=onepage&q=the%20role%20of%20guns%20in%20westward%20expansion&f=false) burgeoned as American, British, and French forces sought to leverage Native alliances against one another as they fought for territory beyond the original colonies.
1.12.5.3.2. Pro: Prior to colonization, the West was full of vast expanses of dangerous and uncharted wilderness; therefore fur-trappers, traders, explorers, and other frontiersmen needed to carry firearms in order to ensure their safety.
1.12.5.3.2.1. Pro: This is still true today in places like Alaska where firearms are still considered necessary for [bear defense](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261982557_Efficacy_of_Firearms_for_Bear_Deterrence_in_Alaska).
1.12.5.3.3. Pro: [Gunslingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfighter) and gun-toting cowboys were a staple of the American Old West, and remain prominent in global mainstream media as a symbol of American history and culture.
1.12.5.3.4. Con: Contrary to popular thought, many municipalities in the Old West enforced [stricter gun control regulations](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gun-control-old-west-180968013/) back then compared to today.
1.12.5.3.4.1. Pro: Aside from the Second Amendment, most gun-control regulations were passed on the [local level](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gun-control-old-west-180968013/) and typically mandated that visitors turn their weapons over to law enforcement upon entering the town. In exchange, the officer would give them a token that would need to be returned in order to get their gun back when leaving.
1.12.6. Con: A subjective definition of what it means to "be an American" is not a valid defense of gun ownership.
1.12.7. Con: Repealing the Second Amendment does not mean removing the right to buy and own guns. It simply means removing that clause from the Constitution. There is no clause in the Constitution that protects the right to own a car or possess alcohol, but we still retain those rights.
1.12.7.1. Con: The right to bear arms is of more importance as it helps to protect America's freedom. This cannot be said about consumer goods like cars and alcohol.
1.13. Con: The right to bear arms is essential to protect a free society against external as well as internal threats.
1.13.1. Pro: The right to bear arms helps prevent the country from becoming more of a police state. If the only ones allowed to bear arms are military and police forces, then power is too concentrated.
1.13.1.1. Con: In fact, the opposite is true. Because the populace is so heavily armed, common police \(and even lowly convenience store security guards\) must also be heavily armed, leading to much more police-state dystopianism. Cultures \(like the UK\) where gun ownership is broadly illegal often have unarmed police who are actually non-threatening and friendly.
1.13.1.2. Con: -> See 1.12.7.
1.13.2. Con: By this logic, most countries with far stricter gun laws should not be free and democratic. Yet many of the countries with far stricter gun laws are thriving democracies.
1.13.2.1. Pro: According to the [Freedom in the World Index](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores) by Freedom House, dozens of countries with stricter gun laws than the US are considered more free.
1.13.2.2. Pro: In fact, many countries with strict gun laws look more democratic than the US. In the Economist's Democracy Index, the US is not even part of the "full democracy" group, whereas twenty-one other countries are \([EIU, p. 5](http://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy_Index_2017.pdf&mode=wp&campaignid=DemocracyIndex2017)\).
1.13.2.3. Con: Most countries with stricter gun laws are less free than America. According to the [Freedom in the World Index](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores) by Freedom House, the United States currently ranks 55th out of 210 countries.
1.13.2.3.1. Con: According to this index, most countries of the [Western European and Others Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_and_Others_Group) \(against which the US is most often compared\) have a better freedom score than the United States despite their strict gun regulations.
1.13.2.3.2. Con: Correlation does not imply causation; there could be many other reasons why there are fewer freedoms, e.g. the US' absolutist approach to freedom of speech.
1.13.2.4. Con: At the same time, there are also examples of democracies with an unarmed populace that slowly degraded into tyranny \(Germany being one example\). There are no examples of this happening when the populace was armed.
1.13.2.4.1. Con: The presence of guns would not have saved Germany from turning into a dictatorship as large parts of the population were welcoming this development.
1.13.2.5. Con: This logic is faulty. The right to bear arms does not guarantee a perfect democracy, but provides a significant obstacle to tyranny. Democracies without the right to bear arms are not a contradiction, they are just vulnerable.
1.13.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.10.
1.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.9.4.
1.13.4. Pro: The right to bear arms enables citizens to resist against tyranny.
1.13.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.1.
1.13.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.3.2.
1.13.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.
1.13.5. Pro: If a successful fight against a tyrannical government hinges on the right to bear arms, then the tyrannical government could easily crush the resistance by taking that right away.
1.13.5.1. Con: Even through the government can repeal the Second Amendment, the rights it grants still allow citizens to arm themselves in preparation for the government turning tyrannical.
1.13.5.2. Con: This is exactly why gun owners so ardently defend their right to bear arms. The main claim here is that the Second Amendment should be repealed. If the government tries to eliminate the right to bear arms it would be a rather clear signal that it is bent on tyranny.
1.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.
1.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.5.
1.13.8. Con: With an armed populace, armed conflict between factions seems like a far more likely result of a threat from the state against its citizens. Strong democratic institutions constitute a far better guarantee against state-sanctioned harassment than the right of every citizen to bear arms.
1.14. Con: The Second Amendment should be amended to take into account changing priorities, but not repealed.
1.14.1. Pro: Repealing the 2nd Amendment would not change much at all in the United States. Over 40 states have an [unambiguous equivalent](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm) to the 2nd Amendment which protects an "individual" right to bear arms.
1.14.2. Pro: Legislation should be relevant to the people and the times for it to be effective. Policies, standards and procedures get regularly reviewed to ensure desired results are achievable. An update of the 2nd amendment without changing the underlying intent would make it more relevant for today’s society.
1.14.3. Con: [Legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States) already legally sets limits on the 2nd Amendment, so it doesn't need to be amended.
