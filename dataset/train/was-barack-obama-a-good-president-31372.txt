Discussion Name: Was Barack Obama a good president?

1. Barack Obama was a good president.
1.1. Pro: Obama implemented many social policies which greatly benefited America.
1.1.1. Pro: Obama's policies have been significantly beneficial for racial minorities in the US.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Barack Obama pushed for investment in urban communities, which was extremely beneficial for the [growth of black wealth](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2018/10/black-wealth-decrease-president-obama-181020062508463.html).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: In spite of this, average black home equity was [still $16,700 lower](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality) in 2016 than it was before the Obama administration.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The unemployment rate for black Americans [fell to around](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/us/politics/fact-check-trump-jobs-black-americans.html) 7.8% during the Obama administration, from 12.7% during the Great Recession.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Obama's "Jump-start Our Business Start-up" \(JOBS\) Act has created [significant ease](https://www.blackenterprise.com/equity-crowdfunding-black-investors-entrepreneurs/) for minority business owners.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Between 2007 and 2016, the number of women-owned firms grew at a rate 5 times the national average, more than doubling the number of firms owned by [African American women and Hispanic women.](https://www.blackenterprise.com/obamas-legacy-in-supporting-small-businesses/)
1.1.1.4. Con: [Surveys show](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/social_issues/voters_say_trump_better_for_blacks_than_obama_but_more_is_needed) that 33% of US voters believe that life for black individuals has gotten better since Trump's election, whereas only 13% thought so at the end of the Obama-era.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: A [poll by Gallup](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/17/no-one-third-of-african-americans-dont-support-trump-not-even-close/) showed that these approval ratings were not entirely accurate, and that Trump's realistic African American approval ranged from around 10 to 15 percent.
1.1.1.5. Con: President Obama's [policies regarding unions](https://www.nationalbcc.org/news/beyond-the-rhetoric/1176-president-obama-is-selling-out-blacks-for-union-favor) have been extremely exclusionary and detrimental towards African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
1.1.1.6. Pro: During his 8 years in office, Obama [introduced](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration) a range of programs targeted specifically towards enfranchising the worst-off African Americans, to considerable success.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: In partnership with Urban Alliance, the Obama Foundation created the [Obama Youth Jobs Corps](https://theurbanalliance.org/our-programs/obama-youth-jobs-corps/) \(OYJC\) to increase access to economic opportunity for high school students in some of the most underprivileged communities in Chicago, which are comprised of a [majority African-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side,_Chicago#Demographics) demographic.
1.1.1.6.2. Con: These programs have been cited as evidence of Obama's [detrimentally timid approach](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-barack-obama-failed-black-americans/511358/) regarding racial inequalities, avoiding more "aggressive" transformative policies in favour of incremental ones that have not been significantly, disproportionately beneficial to - and thus motivational for - African Americans.
1.1.1.6.3. Con: Though he created some new programs that may have enfranchised people of colour, Obama also allowed the continuation of established ones that had a history of poor success.
1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: In 2013, the Obama administration [freed up money](https://www.rollcall.com/2013/05/15/job-corps-hits-turning-point-under-congress-watch/) from other employment training programs to continue funding [Job Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Corps), a program primarily used by black and hispanic youth to access free education or training. Though superficially effective, this program has not been found to successfully enfranchise its students.
1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The inspector general’s 2018 report on Job Corps found that the training offered [no discernible long-term benefit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/26/us/politics/job-corps-training-program.html) for graduates when compared with the non-college-educated population in general.
1.1.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: Job Corps reports that 87% of graduates at most centers find work upon completion of the program; however, many of these jobs are in the [same low-wage, low-skill](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/26/us/politics/job-corps-training-program.html) jobs that could have been secured without the program.
1.1.1.6.3.1.3. Pro: During Obama's presidency, high-profile incidents of [illegal drug use](https://youthtoday.org/2009/10/how-not-to-handle-sex-drugs-and-violence-at-job-corps/), [violence](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shocking-violence-casts-shadow-over-federal-job-corps-program) and [sexual assault](https://bangordailynews.com/2019/07/05/news/bangor/former-student-says-job-training-centers-breach-in-protocol-allowed-her-to-be-sexually-assaulted/) among enrolled students at Job Corps Centers were reported.
1.1.1.6.4. Pro: By 2016, over one million more black and Hispanic students had [enrolled in college](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration) since Obama had taken office.
1.1.1.6.5. Pro: In 2014, Obama launched a public-private initiative called '[My Brother's Keeper](https://theundefeated.com/features/my-brothers-keeper-and-obamas-mission-to-help-young-men-of-color/)', which offers mentoring and educational programs to men of colour to help them reach their potential.
1.1.1.6.5.1. Con: This programme has been [criticised](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-barack-obama-failed-black-americans/511358/) for its misguided focus on reforming its mentees' outlook and actions rather than directly increasing their resources or the constraints they face as a result of systemic racial inequality.
1.1.1.7. Pro: By 2015, the drop in the number of [African Americans living below the poverty line](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration) represented the fastest decline since 1999.
1.1.1.8. Con: [34%](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/) of black Americans think Obama has tried but failed to make progress on racial relations.
1.1.2. Pro: Obama implemented the [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act](https://www.dhs.gov/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca) \(DACA\), which benefited undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The DACA afforded undocumented immigrants [access](https://www.vox.com/2017/9/2/16244380/daca-benefits-trump-undocumented-immigrants-jobs) to greater educational and employment opportunities.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The DACA [shielded](https://www.vox.com/2017/9/2/16244380/daca-benefits-trump-undocumented-immigrants-jobs) undocumented immigrants from deportation for up to two years. This enabled over [690,000 people](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/6/16431524/daca-how-many) to access temporary social security numbers and public services.
1.1.2.3. Con: While many Obama supporters criticise Trump's tough stance on immigration, Obama deported [significantly more](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-trump-has-deported-fewer-immigrants-than-obama-11564824601) immigrants than Trump.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: A numbers-by-numbers contrast of immigrants deported arguably does not provide an accurate picture of Obama's stance on immigrant rights as compared with Trump's.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: According to a top Domestic Policy Advisor to Obama during his presidency, Obama prioritised deporting [criminals and new arrivals](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/13/politics/obama-trump-deportations-illegal-immigration/index.html), suggesting that he considered the impact that deportation could have on different categories of undocumented immigrants. This is in stark contrast to Trump's [deport-all](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/18/trump-deportation-illegal-aliens-1367012) approach.
1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The Cato Institute found that deportations from the interior of the country - meaning away from the border, so, people who have likely been in the country longer - were on the [decrease](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/13/politics/obama-trump-deportations-illegal-immigration/index.html) for most of the Obama administration.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: [Statistics by](https://www.axios.com/immigration-ice-deportation-trump-obama-a72a0a44-540d-46bc-a671-cd65cf72f4b1.html) the Department of Homeland Security show that Obama's deportations per year hit a high of 409,849 people, whereas Trump's highest hit 282,342 people.
1.1.3. Con: The Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund [significantly depleted](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/president-obamas-failure-on-social-security-disability-) during Obama's presidency, adversely affecting many Americans, because of his failure to develop a long-term solution to prevent its bankruptcy.
1.1.3.1. Con: The number of beneficiaries of disability insurance [peaked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/04/07/white-house-budget-directors-claim-that-social-security-disability-is-very-wasteful/) during Obama's presidency at 11 million. This means that even though funding for disability insurance may have fallen, more Americans were able to benefit from disability insurance than ever before. Hence, Americans in need of disability insurance were better off during Obama's presidency.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Because of this depletion, beneficiaries [faced](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/president-obamas-failure-on-social-security-disability-) benefit cuts across-the-board of around 19% in the latter and after years of Obama's presidency.
1.1.4. Pro: Obama's social policies regarding LGBTQ+ individuals have elevated their social status and benefited them tremendously.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Obama [signed the](http://huffpost.com/entry/hate-crimes-bill-to-be-si_n_336883) Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, making it a federal hate crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender and gender identity.
1.1.4.2. Pro: [Obama signed](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/executive-order-further-amendments-executive-order-11478-equal-employmen) Executive Order 11478 in 2014, which provided individuals with legal protection against discrimination in the hiring process based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Obama [extended the](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-expands-family-medical-leave-act-to-cover-gay-employees) Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to include employees taking unpaid leave to care for the children of same-sex couples.
1.1.4.4. Pro: By repealing Defense Directive 1304.26, [Obama allowed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/22/obama-repeals-dont-ask-dont-tell) openly gay individuals to serve in the military for the first time in US history.
1.1.4.5. Con: At least until 2010 when Obama's views started wavering, he [opposed same-sex marriage](https://time.com/3816952/obama-gay-lesbian-transgender-lgbt-rights/).
1.1.4.5.1. Con: Obama ultimately became the [first president to support same-sex marriage](https://time.com/3816952/obama-gay-lesbian-transgender-lgbt-rights/), making him a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ civil rights.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: A [series](https://www.advocate.com/politics/politicians/2015/02/16/11-most-significant-presidents-lgbt-americans?pg=1) of presidents preceding Obama passed civil-rights legislation that significantly improved the lives of the LGBTQ+ community.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The presidents preceding Obama were faced with a much [more homophobic climate](https://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/american-acceptance-of-homosexuality-gss-report.aspx). Comparatively, therefore, it cannot be said that Obama was a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ rights.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the 1970s and 1980s, at least [70%](https://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/american-acceptance-of-homosexuality-gss-report.aspx) of Americans thought same-sex relations were "always wrong". As such, [Nixon's and Carter's](https://www.advocate.com/politics/politicians/2015/02/16/11-most-significant-presidents-lgbt-americans?pg=1) LGBTQ+ policies were truly trailblazing.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: The shift in Obama's views on same-sex marriage in 2010 coincided with polls showing that [55% of Democrat voters agreed](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) with same-sex marriage. It may be inferred from this that Obama's views wavered not because he sought to benefit LGBTQ+ people per se, but rather to benefit his political party.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: A majority of Democrats [supported](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) same-sex marriage as early as 2007; hence, it is unclear if it was this shift in public opinion which pushed Obama to change his stance on same-sex marriage.
1.1.4.6. Con: Despite Obama's policies to assist LGBTQ+ individuals, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination has been on the rise in the United States.
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: The number of crimes based on sexual orientation between 2014 to 2017 - while Obama was still in elected office - [rose in each](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/28/anti-gay-hate-crimes-rise-fbi-says-and-they-likely-undercount/1582614001/) subsequent year.
1.1.4.6.2. Pro: In 2017, there was an 86% increase in [single incident reports](https://avp.org/a-crisis-of-hate-january/) of anti-LGBTQ+ violence as compared to 2016. This suggests that, in reality, Obama's policies have had little lasting effect on LGBTQ+ rights.
1.1.4.6.3. Con: The continued increase in anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination into the present day is likelier a result of the Trump administration's [change of policies](https://abcnews.go.com/US/recent-lgbtq-attacks-highlight-hate-crimes/story?id=63575407) than a failure by the Obama administration to address them.
1.1.4.6.3.1. Pro: In 2017, Trump repealed an Obama administration policy that [protected transgender individuals](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-obama-policies-trump-killed-were-some-of-the-44th-presidents-hallmark-achievements-13130973) from discrimination.
1.1.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: A Supreme Court filing has [revealed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-trangender-workers-civil-rights-supreme-court-lgbtq-aimee-stephens-a9063646.html) that the Trump administration believes that transgender people aren't protected by civil rights legislation which seeks to guard against employment discrimination.
1.1.5. Con: Obama's social policies did not benefit religious and conservative Americans, as they undermined many of their core values.
1.1.5.1. Con: Obama [secured](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/22/why-did-obama-win-more-white-evangelical-votes-than-clinton-he-asked-for-them/) a significant portion of the white evangelical vote during both his election campaigns; if this voting bloc had grievances against him, they would have voted for the Republican candidate in overwhelming numbers.
1.1.5.2. Con: Obama [continued to allow](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/17/president-obama-signs-executive-order-implement-reform-recommendations-p) federal funding for faith-based groups, albeit with increasing transparency, despite facing [strong opposition](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-executive-order-faith-based-initiative-church/story?id=12180146) to this.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Obama's growing support for same-sex marriage angered many conservative Americans.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: In 2008, Obama won votes from conservatives through his support of the [Defence of Marriage Act](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Defense-of-Marriage-Act). However, he reversed his position completely in 2011, when he instructed the Attorney General to stop defending it in court. This is seen as a [betrayal](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/06/a-history-of-evangelical-fear/563558/) by conservative Evangelicals.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage in 2012 was a [huge blow](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/05/09/gIQAivsWDU_story.html) to his conservative supporters.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Actions of the Obama administration infringed on the right to religious freedom of individuals and states.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: The [First Amendment](https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment1.html) in the US Constitution states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"; by this logic, it is unconstitutional for the law to be influenced by religious values.
1.1.5.4.2. Pro: Obama barred states from [denying](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/14/505595090/obama-administration-moves-to-protect-planned-parenthoods-federal-funding) funding to Planned Parenthood, which many pro-life Americans and religious conservatives disagreed strongly with.
1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Evangelical Christians made the funding of Planned Parenthood one of their [primary voting issues](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/07/politics/evangelicals-defunding-planned-parenthood/index.) in the 2016 presidential election in response to Obama's ban.
1.1.5.4.3. Pro: Obama [required all employers](https://www.npr.org/2012/01/08/144835720/has-obama-waged-a-war-on-religion) - including religious affiliated charities, hospitals, and colleges - to pay for health insurance for their workers which covered access to contraceptives, something many Christian Americans are fundamentally opposed to.
1.1.5.4.3.1. Con: While the majority of Christian Americans are opposed to abortion and homosexuality, [very few](https://www.pewforum.org/2016/09/28/4-very-few-americans-see-contraception-as-morally-wrong/) believe that contraception is morally wrong.
1.1.5.4.4. Pro: Trump gained significant [support](https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/10/06/trump-administration-reverses-obama-era-policies-on-religious-freedom/) from religious Americans for promising to repeal Obama's limitations on religious freedom. This demonstrates that many Americans felt that these did not benefit society, but instead were harmful additions to it.
1.1.5.4.5. Pro: The Obama administration was willing to sacrifice religious freedom in favour of [sexual progressivism](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/01/obama-administration-has-troubled-religious-liberty-legacy/).
1.1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Some consider the Obama administration's introduction of the [Equality Act](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/07/15381/) to be an erosion of religious liberty because it prescribed an opinion on sexuality that jarred with biblical and conservative sexual morality.
1.1.5.4.5.1.1. Pro: [21 prominent religious leaders](https://www.christianpost.com/news/21-christian-leaders-say-the-equality-act-is-incompatible-with-gods-word.html) have spoken up against the Equality Act, and how it curtails religious liberty.
1.1.5.4.5.1.2. Pro: The [Equality Act](https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-equality-act) was created to provide federal anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people across employment, education, public, and housing sectors. Such wide-reaching protections across multiple aspects of societal life mean that the Equality Act inevitably impinges upon the lives of people whose religious views are incompatible with what it implies about sexuality.
1.1.5.4.6. Con: Obama [signed](https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/obama-signs-bipartisan-international-religious-freedom-bill) the [Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act](https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/what-is-the-frank-wolf-international-religious-freedom-act), which condemns international violations of religious freedom and ensures that the US actively promotes and protects religious freedom internationally.
1.1.5.4.6.1. Con: The bill from which the [Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act](https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/what-is-the-frank-wolf-international-religious-freedom-act) originated had [100 bipartisan co-sponsors](https://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/12/19/president-obama-signs-religious-freedom-bill/). Therefore, the Act should not be attributed solely to Obama or the Obama administration.
1.1.6. Pro: Obama's Affordable Care Act - dubbed "[Obamacare](https://www.thebalance.com/obamacare-explained-3306058)" - has benefited millions of Americans.
1.1.6.1. Pro: [6.6 million](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2012/07/12/11843/update-how-obamacare-is-benefiting-americans/) more young adults have access to healthcare coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act.
1.1.6.2. Pro: As of 2018 and since the Affordable Care Act became law, [20.1 million](https://fortune.com/2018/11/15/obamacare-americans-with-health-insurance-uninsured/) more Americans have health insurance.
1.1.6.3. Con: Obamacare has [exacerbated government debt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/11/02/thanks-to-obamacare-government-debt-is-worse-than-you-think/#7973e0bf15f9), which harms Americans.
1.1.6.4. Pro: In a 2020 public poll conducted by a nonprofit health foundation, Obamacare won 55% support, its [“highest rating”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2020/02/21/poll-obamacare-more-popular-than-ever/) since becoming law. This suggests many Americans feel it benefits them.
1.1.6.5. Con: [Obamacare](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/7-obamacare-failures-that-have-hurt-americans-2016-03-24) cost people a lot of money and left many without insurance.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Cumulatively from 2010 to 2017, Obamacare reduced health care spending by a total of $2.3 trillion, saving about [$4,000 per family](https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/22/affordable-care-act-controls-costs/).
1.1.6.5.2. Con: A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272718302408#!) has shown that low-income families with subsidized health coverage through the ACA had greatly decreased out-of-pocket medical spending and were 25% less likely to miss rent or mortgage payments than those without.
1.1.6.5.3. Pro: After the Affordable Care Act, [around 5 million](https://www.thebalance.com/obamas-health-care-reform-2645661) Americans lost their healthcare benefits, due to the non-compliance of insurers with Obamacare standards.
1.2. Con: Obama failed to fulfill his campaign promises.
1.2.1. Con: Obama was successful in fulfilling his campaign promises regarding pressing social issues.
1.2.1.1. Con: Obama failed in his promises [to help undocumented immigrants](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/obamas-failed-promise-to-immigrant-families).
1.2.1.2. Con: Obama failed in his promises to fix gun control.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Rather than successfully passing gun control measures, Obama's presidency saw [a further reduction](https://www.thoughtco.com/obama-gun-laws-passed-by-congress-3367595) in gun restrictions instead.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: During Obama's presidency, the Senate voted to [permit](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-votes-to-allow-guns-on-amtrak/) guns to be transported in checked baggage on Amtrak trains.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Under the [separation of powers](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_powers_0), the Senate is an independent body to the executive. It is not reasonable to hold Obama accountable for the actions of the independent Senate.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: During Obama's presidency, the Senate voted to [allow](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/22/national-parks-will-open-gates-to-holders-of-conce/) the concealed carry of firearms in national parks.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Obama failed to deliver on the promise of gun regulation due to the immense lobbying [power and influence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/nra-gun-lobby-gun-control-congress) of the National Rifle Association \(NRA\).
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Obama was aware of the immense lobbying power of the NRA when he promised to introduce stricter gun laws during his election campaign. The fact that this was an unrealistic promise does not exonerate him, but is instead suggestive of manipulative and misleading campaign promises.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [immense lobbying power](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/nra-gun-lobby-gun-control-congress) of the NRA is well known and well entrenched.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Con: The fact that Obama's promise on stricter gun control was always going to be difficult does not necessarily suggest manipulation. It could just as easily show his perseverance against the odds because it was something he felt strongly about.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: The NRA spends a lot of capital and resources in its lobbying efforts, which have made it one of the [most powerful lobbies](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/taking-on-the-n-r-a) in the US.
1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The influence of the NRA [cannot](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/nra-gun-lobby-gun-control-congress) solely be explained by its lobbying power, as other industries - which have been less successful in wielding influence - have much greater financial capital to expend towards extracting concessions.
1.2.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: In 2017, the NRA [spent $4.1 million](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/17/nra-gun-lobby-gun-control-congress) solely on lobbying for expanded gun rights.
1.2.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: The NRA spent [$1.6 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/nra-spent-1point6-million-lobbying-against-expanded-background-check-laws.html) lobbying against background check expansion laws.
1.2.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: The NRA spent a record [$9.6 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-05/nra-spent-record-amount-lobbying-congress-with-little-to-show) on lobbying with lawmakers and federal agencies in 2017 and 2018.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Obama [has been criticized](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2018-02-20/gun-control-and-immigration-battles-show-where-obama-failed) for not engaging in enough public persuasion or legislative deal-making to see firmer policies on gun control successfully implemented.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Obama has consistently [called](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/nra-money-isnt-why-gun-control-efforts-are-failing-commentary.html) for 'common sense' gun-control legislation on public platforms in the aftermath of mass shootings, without detailing the specific legislative mechanisms required to tackle the issue.
1.2.1.2.3.2. Con: Obama went to [great lengths](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-obama-faced-relentless-opposition-gun-reform-after-sandy-hook-2019-8?r=US&IR=T) to push gun-rights legislation through Congress despite facing significant opposition.
1.2.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Obama did not do so consistently, but only when [public opinion began to sway](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shooting-connecticut-obama/analysis-shocked-obama-wants-to-target-gun-violence-but-how-idUSBRE8BG0N220121217) in favour of tightening gun control laws midway through his presidency.
1.2.1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Obama [expressed approval of the Second Amendment](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/16/obama-gun-control-227625) during his 2008 presidential campaign and did not take meaningful action on gun control until the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, when he appeared to upend this stance entirely. This mirrors the views of the American people, who polls show had been generally wary of increased gun control [until](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shooting-connecticut-obama/analysis-shocked-obama-wants-to-target-gun-violence-but-how-idUSBRE8BG0N220121217) Sandy Hook.
1.2.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Less than a month after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, Obama announced a [detailed 4-part plan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf) for reducing gun violence that included 23 executive actions, signed immediately by himself, and 12 proposals for Congress.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Obama took action to combat climate change.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Even the best case impacts of Obama's signature climate change legislation - the Clean Power Plan - would [bring](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/obamas-climate-plan-was-failure-all-accounts) about a temperature decrease of 0.02C, which has been deemed by experts as 'scientifically undetectable and environmentally insignificant'.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: In 2016 Obama formally entered the US into the [Paris Agreement](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/09/03/president-obama-united-states-formally-enters-paris-agreement), which is regarded by many as the most ambitious climate agreement in history.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The Paris Agreement on climate change was [historic](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/10/05/president-obama-marks-historic-moment-our-global-efforts-combat-climate-change) in that it was the first time that China and the US - which represent 40% of the world's total emissions - mutually agreed on a carbon emission reduction framework.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: The Paris Agreement aims to keep the global temperature rise within 2 degrees Celsius, which - if successful - will significantly [strengthen the efforts](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement) against climate change.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Obama successfully passed the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2012/07/12/11843/update-how-obamacare-is-benefiting-americans/) \(ACA\) - one of his core campaign promises.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: While Obama was able to pass the ACA, the [rollout](https://www.businessinsider.com/obamacare-rollout-disaster-is-a-political-embarrassment-and-an-opening-for-the-republicans-2013-10?r=US&IR=T) of Obamacare was a disaster, and many Americans were unable to benefit from it.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.2. Con: Obama successfully fulfilled his promises regarding foreign policy.
1.2.2.1. Con: Obama promised to end conflict in Iraq, but his withdrawal of troops [has been criticised](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/07/the-mess-obama-left-behind-in-iraq-surge-debate/) as a move that increased conflict in Iraq.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: During Obama's administration jihadist groups became [significantly more powerful](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-obama-legacy-on-jihadism).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: There is no reason to believe that the [small number of troops in Iraq](https://www.justsecurity.org/61991/false-comparisons-obamas-military-withdrawal-iraq-trumps-syria-disengagement/) would have been able to prevent conflict had Obama not withdrawn them.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq, without catering to the power vacuum created, facilitated [the rise of ISIS.](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/how-2011-us-troop-withdrawal-iraq-led-rise-isis)
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Obama's [failure to negotiate](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/world/middleeast/failed-efforts-of-americas-last-months-in-iraq.html) a power-sharing arrangement between Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and Ayad Allawi - a secular Shiite and the leader of a bloc with broad Sunni support - led to regional instability, which ISIS took advantage of.
1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: After US troops left Iraq, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki consolidated his power and began aggressively [oppressing Iraq’s Sunni tribes](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/how-2011-us-troop-withdrawal-iraq-led-rise-isis), which [played in ISIS's favour](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/in-their-own-words-sunnis-on-their-treatment-in-malikis-iraq/). A power-sharing arrangement with Ayad Allawi may have avoided this.
1.2.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: After the persecution and oppression of Sunni tribes by al-Maliki, Sunni tribes were ripe to become [sympathetic toward or join ISIS](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/17995846/the-conflict-between-iraqi-sunnis-and-shias-sustains-isis), who are Sunnis.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Since Obama had [promised](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-usa-obama/obama-troops-leaving-iraq-with-heads-held-high-idUSTRE7BD1ME20111214) to withdraw troops from Iraq, it was more important for him to fulfil that promise once he got elected, as any good president should.
1.2.2.2. Con: In 2013 Obama promised to [end the US war in Afghanistan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/12/weekly-address-ending-war-afghanistan-and-rebuilding-america) and remove US military presence almost entirely by the end of the next year, yet at the end of his presidency there remained [8400 US troops](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/timeline-military-presence-afghanistan-190908070831251.html) in Afghanistan.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Obama fulfilled his promise of helping Afghanistan [strengthen](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/165/train-and-equip-the-afghan-army/) its own armed forces.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Despite an increase in numbers, by the end of Obama's presidency the Afghan forces still [lacked](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/165/train-and-equip-the-afghan-army/) many support functions, such as intelligence, reconnaissance and speciality teams like medical evacuation.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: During Obama's presidency, the number of Afghanis in the armed forces more than [doubled](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/165/train-and-equip-the-afghan-army/) from 140,000 in 2009 to 320,000 in 2016, resulting in more than 80% of their missions operating without US or NATO support.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Following Obama's promise to reduce Russian and US nuclear stockpiles, he signed the [New Start Treaty](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/world/europe/23treaty.html?_r=1) with Russia, which involved both countries agreeing to [reduce](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/195/seek-verifiable-reductions-in-nuclear-stockpiles/) their nuclear arsenal.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: [According](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/obama-claims-nuclear-weapons-reductions-start-treaty) to experts, the reduction in nuclear stockpiles is negligible, and has little to do with Obama's START treaty with Russia.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: The New START treaty places significantly more obligations and restrictions on the US, [putting](https://www.heritage.org/arms-control/report/new-strategic-arms-reduction-treaty-time-stop-the-damage-us-national-security) it at a disadvantage to Russia.
1.2.2.4.3. Con: Despite his commitment to a world without nuclear weapons, Obama [made fewer reductions](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/27/obama-has-failed-to-deliver-on-nuclear-disarmament-promises) to the US nuclear weapons stockpile than any president since the end of the cold war.
1.2.3. Pro: Not only did Obama fail to fulfil most of his [promises](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20699847?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) regarding the protection of human rights and civil liberties, his administration saw a further [disregardation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/04/barack-obamas-shaky-legacy-on-human-rights/) in such rights.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Obama promised to eliminate warrantless wiretaps but [loopholes in the legislation](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/180/end-warrantless-wiretaps/) he created failed to get rid of the practice.
1.2.3.2. Con: Obama succeeded in his promises to reform the justice system.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Obama [fulfilled his promise](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-criminal-justice-reform-prison-sentencing-police) to reduce the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Obama's involvement in justice reform [stunted bipartisan progress](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvewn7/how-criminal-justice-reform-died-bill-keller) in Congress as Republicans dragged their heels for fear of making concessions that would look like a win for Obama.
1.2.3.3. Con: Obama was able to [keep](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/153/include-humanitarian-international-missions-in-lon/) his promise of expanding on military-led international humanitarian missions and increasing humanitarian aid.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Obama [failed](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/511/recognize-armenian-genocide/) to keep his promise of recognising the Armenian genocide while he was in office.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Obama's influence could have been the reason why his Vice President, Joe Biden, eventually [recognized the Armenian genocide](https://time.com/5959135/biden-armenia-genocide/) as soon as he became President.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Obama failed to fulfil his promise to [close down](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/guantanamo-bay-detainees-obama-final-transfers) Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: Obama was successful in considerably [reducing](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/guantanamo-numbers) the number of inmates at Guantanamo Bay, during his presidency, from about 242 to 41.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: Reducing the number of prisoners is major progress towards being able to close the base in the future.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: It is [Congress](https://www.voanews.com/usa/obama-condemns-congress-failure-close-guantanamo), and not Obama, that is to blame for failing to close down Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
1.2.3.5.2.1. Con: Obama [faltered](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/guantanamo-bay-detainees-obama-final-transfers) in creating a comprehensive policy agenda on Guantanamo to push through in Congress, focusing on much more piecemeal changes such as prioritising the transfer of 'cleared' detainees, over more institutional reform such as ending the role of military tribunals.
1.2.3.5.2.2. Pro: Congress passed [laws](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2788) [prohibiting](https://time.com/4179278/state-of-the-union-guantanamo-bay-president-obama/) the use of funds to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
1.2.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: In 2015, the Republican-controlled Senate passed legislation [prohibiting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/senate-defense-budget-bill-bans-transfer-guantanamo-bay-prisoners-to-us) the Obama administration from relocating prisoners in Guantanamo to facilities in the United States.
1.2.3.5.2.3. Pro: The Republicans in Congress [vowed to challenge](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo/exclusive-obama-administration-not-pursuing-executive-order-to-shut-guantanamo-sources-idUSKCN0YZ11V) any potential executive action by Obama, seeking to close Guantanamo Bay in court.
1.2.3.5.2.4. Pro: The Republican Party [had a majority](https://qz.com/547445/to-close-the-prison-at-guantanamo-bay-obama-must-outmaneuver-a-deadlocked-us-congress/) in Congress at the time Obama tried to close down Guantanamo Bay which meant all of his legislative efforts resulted in failure.
1.2.3.5.3. Pro: Obama's [failure](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/24/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-republicans) to detail a transitionary process for dealing with remaining detainees made it very practically difficult to close down Guantanamo Bay.
1.2.3.6. Con: Obama was largely able to fulfil his promise of [ending torture](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/175/end-the-use-of-torture/) through his [executive order](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/ensuring-lawful-interrogations) to ensure lawful interrogations and humane treatment of prisoners.
1.2.3.6.1. Con: A closer reading of this executive order reveals that not all torture techniques were rendered unlawful because [psychological torture](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/25/obama-administration-military-torture-army-field-manual) could still be used on grounds of the 'war on terror'.
1.2.3.6.1.1. Pro: [Human rights organisations](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/25/obama-administration-military-torture-army-field-manual) identify that techniques including sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, and solitary confinement can still be used despite Obama's executive order.
1.2.3.6.1.2. Pro: The [UN's committee against torture](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/28/un-condemns-sleep-deprivation-among-us-detainees) heavily criticised the US military's continued use of torture despite Obama's attempt to eliminate it.
1.2.3.6.2. Con: Despite Obama's executive order to end torture, he [refused to prosecute](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/04/barack-obamas-shaky-legacy-on-human-rights/) perpetrators or disclose comprehensive reports on it. This undermined the material impact of the order by signalling that he did not take accountability or transparency seriously.
1.2.3.6.3. Pro: Obama signed this executive order on his [second day in office](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/campaigns/never-torture/facts-torture), thereby fulfilling his campaign promise to end torture almost instantaneously.
1.2.4. Pro: Obama failed in his [promises](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/barack-obama-revolving-door-lobbying-217042) to limit the influence of special interests and increase transparency in the legislature.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Obama's legislation to limit the power of lobbyists [had several loopholes](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/barack-obama-revolving-door-lobbying-217042) and proved ineffective.
1.2.4.2. Con: Obama was able to fulfil his promise of providing voters with [greater transparency and disclosure](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/230/centralize-ethics-and-lobbying-information-for-vot/) of important information about public officials by launching the website [ethic.gov.](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/21stcenturygov/tools/ethics)
1.3. Con: Obama failed to bridge the partisan divide and be a good president to all Americans.
1.3.1. Con: A number of Obama's most important accomplishments were achieved through bipartisanship.
1.3.1.1. Pro: With the exception of the Affordable Care Act, the vast majority of major legislation that Obama pushed through Congress [had](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/16/obamas_unsung_bipartisan_legacy_132798.html) bipartisan support.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The [Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act](https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/what-is-the-frank-wolf-international-religious-freedom-act) was enacted under Obama's administration following [significant bipartisan co-sponsorship](https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/what-is-the-frank-wolf-international-religious-freedom-act).
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: [The Recovery Act](https://www.thebalance.com/arra-details-3306299) - Obama's stimulus for recession recovery - only passed after Obama agreed to a number of [concessions](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/16/obamas_unsung_bipartisan_legacy_132798.html) with Senate Republicans.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Obama's passing of the Dodd-Frank Act [relied](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/16/obamas_unsung_bipartisan_legacy_132798.html)(The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill also squeaked through the Senate with three Republican votes. Obama sealed the deal after making a key concession to newly elected Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown, scrapping an outright ban on commercial banks investing in high-risk funds in favor of allowing limited investments.) on him negotiating with Republican senators around an outright ban on commercial banks investing in high-risk funds.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: A [survey](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2017/politifact/obameter/bipartisan/) of more than 20 political scientists and historians revealed that not even one of them believed that bipartisan ties grew stronger during the Obama administration.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.3. Con: Since Obama's presidency ended with an overall approval rating of [57%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx), it can be said that he was a good president to most Americans.
1.3.3.1. Con: An in-depth analysis of survey data [demonstrates](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/existential-anxiety-not-poverty-motivates-trump-support/558674/) that Obama lost the support of key demographics, such as white men, between 2012 and 2016.
1.3.3.2. Con: Obama's presidency still ended with a majority of the public disapproving of his actions on certain issues, [including](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1726/presidential-ratings-issues-approval.aspx) the economy.
1.3.3.3. Con: The 2016 general election resulted in the election of Donald Trump, a candidate who promised to [revoke](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trump-delivering-on-his-promises-to-reverse-obamas-policies/) many of Obama's policies. This suggests that Obama's policies, and by extension Obama himself, did not successfully represent the will of most Americans during his presidency.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: The will of the people [constantly changes](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-thing-about-the-will-of-the-people-is-that-it-changes) with time; it is likely that the American public simply changed its opinions in 2016 compared to 2012.
1.3.4. Pro: Many of Obama's policies have since been repealed by Trump.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Obama did not reach across the aisle to build policies which had bipartisan support, and this resulted in them being [repealed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/congress-reverses-14-obama-regulations-guns-healthcare-internet-environment-planned-parenthood-a7736156.html) when Republicans took control of Congress.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: [Republican leaders](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-partisan/) believed that Obama did not possess the legislative experience to "cut deals" with them, and did not attempt to bring lawmakers to his side.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Mitch McConnell - US Senate Majority Leader and Republican - wrote [in his book](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-06-22/the-obama-mcconnell-relationship-demonstrates-washington-gridlock) about how Obama would not negotiate with policy issues, but would straw man opposing views to policy to prove any opposition to be incorrect.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.
1.3.4.1.4. Pro: In 2017, Congress voted to undo the Obama-era [regulation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/congress-reverses-14-obama-regulations-guns-healthcare-internet-environment-planned-parenthood-a7736156.html) which allowed Planned Parenthood to receive federal funding.
1.3.4.1.5. Pro: Obama's regulations around gun ownership were [repealed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/congress-reverses-14-obama-regulations-guns-healthcare-internet-environment-planned-parenthood-a7736156.html) by Congress after he left office.
1.3.4.1.6. Pro: Republican lawmakers have [criticised](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-partisan/) Obama's initial approach to governance in 2008, whereby he told Republicans that the large Democratic majority in Congress meant he could do what he wanted without their support. If he had built a working bipartisan relationship, more cooperation may have emerged.
1.3.4.2. Pro: In September 2017, the Trump administration [rescinded a planned](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-obama-policies-trump-killed-were-some-of-the-44th-presidents-hallmark-achievements-13130973) Obama administration rule that would have increased pay transparency and diminished pay gaps.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Trump pulled out of the [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership), which was considered to be a [hallmark trade deal](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-obama-policies-trump-killed-were-some-of-the-44th-presidents-hallmark-achievements-13130973) that was made by the Obama administration.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: This withdrawal was [criticised](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html?auth=login-email&login=email) by a number of fellow Republicans and experts in the field, suggesting that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have continued to be an effective Asian-allyship strategy for the US had the latter retained its signatory status.
1.3.4.4. Con: The fact that the policies of a president are repealed is a poor criterion to gauge their performance in office.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: The fact that many of Obama's actions were repealed or failed to be fully implemented shows that he did not sufficiently persuade politicians and the public of their worth. Being able to convince people who may originally have been opposed to an idea of its value is a crucial skill for a good president to have.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.3.4.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.3.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: Policies which are seen as objectively good may be repealed by worse presidents in the future.
1.3.4.4.2.1. Pro: If President Lincoln's drive to outlaw slavery through the [Thirteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) was reversed by a latter president, this would say more about the latter president's performance than President Lincoln's.
1.3.4.4.3. Pro: Presidents have very little influence on the politics of a country after leaving office. Hence, presidents cannot be judged by the standard of whether their policies were repealed as they cannot control the political process that repeals these policies after they leave office.
1.3.4.4.3.1. Con: President Carter has had immense [influence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/life-ex-president-leaving-office) on US Foreign Policy in the Middle East after leaving office.
1.3.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: President Carter was [integral](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/life-ex-president-leaving-office) in the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel, which normalised relations between the two countries after the [Yom Kippur War.](https://schoolworkhelper.net/yom-kippur-war-camp-david-people-events-significance/)
1.3.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: Carter discussed the strategies for peace in the Middle East [with President Bush](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/03/27/Carter-encouraged-on-Middle-East-peace-prospects/2825638514000/?spt=su) after his visit in 1990.
1.3.4.4.3.2. Pro: President Bush has had very little [influence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/life-ex-president-leaving-office) on the US political system since his departure in 2008.
1.3.4.4.3.3. Con: In 2015, Obama helped pass the [McCain-Feinstein amendment](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jun/16/senate-passes-torture-ban-republicans), which made it harder for future administrations to repeal the ban on torture mandated by the executive order. As such, he ensured that his campaign promise was solidified beyond just the duration of his administration.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1. Con: The amendment attracted significant [opposition](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jun/16/senate-passes-torture-ban-republicans) even at the time of its passing. It is likely that under the current Republican administration - which has a [diametrically opposed view](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/09/27/trumps-human-rights-pick-torture-apologist) on the issue - the amendment may be repealed.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1.1. Con: The fact that the [McCain-Feinstein amendment](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/faq-mccain-feinstein-anti-torture-ndaa-amendment) attracted significant opposition at the time highlights Obama's fortitude in fulfilling his campaign promises.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1.2. Con: Senator McCain, the co-author of the amendment, warned that if officials tried to reinstate a torture policy, then they would face legal action \([Jacobson, p. 105](https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1568&context=jss)\). Therefore, fully repealing the amendment would still be cumbersome.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1.3. Con: [Republican leaders](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-leaders-come-out-against-torture-after-trump-comments/) of both the House and the Senate have expressly condemned the use of torture. As such, it would be politically undesirable and challenging for Trump to repeal the [McCain-Feinstein amendment](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/faq-mccain-feinstein-anti-torture-ndaa-amendment).
1.3.4.4.3.3.1.4. Pro: CIA Director, [Mike Pompeo](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/mike-pompeo-muslims-torture-guantanamo-bay-180313145408365.html), has historically expressed support for interrogational torture, and it is thought that this is what motivated Trump to appoint him.
1.3.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.6.3.1.
1.3.4.6. Con: Trump has consistently [failed](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/14/768731628/trump-is-trying-hard-to-thwart-obamacare-hows-that-going) in attempting to repeal Obama's landmark legislation: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
1.3.4.6.1. Pro: Americans on [both sides](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/most-americans-dont-want-congress-overhaul-health-care-system-obamacare.html) of the political aisle have expressed support for Obamacare over alternative programs.
1.3.4.6.2. Con: At the same time, [certain elements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/house-democrats-join-republicans-to-repeal-obamacares-cadillac-tax/2019/07/17/f8acb86e-a8cc-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html) of the PPACA have been repealed by Congress with bipartisan support.
1.3.4.6.3. Pro: Despite being one of Trump's platform goals, by the time his presidency ended he was [unable to repeal Obamacare](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22238505/donald-trump-obamacare-joe-biden).
1.3.4.7. Con: There are several Obama administration policies - [such as the](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-trump-delivering-on-his-promises-to-reverse-obamas-policies/) financial stimulus of 2009, the auto company [bailout](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/auto-bailout-was-not-unmitigated-success/2012/09/06/4edae4bc-f854-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_story.html?utm_term=.d8dddf64bb2c), and the killing of Bin Laden - which simply can't be reversed.
1.3.4.7.1. Con: While these policies cannot logically be reversed, their ideological trajectory can: for instance, hereafter taking a more hands-off approach to the economy and foreign intervention.
1.3.5. Pro: Obama's government lost the support of voters over the course of his presidency due to his failure to appeal to all Americans.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The rise of [anti-establishment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/national/rise-of-the-anti-establishment-presidential-candidates/1822/?) candidates in the 2016 presidential election is indicative of the fact that Americans on both sides of the political divide became disenchanted with the government during Obama's tenure.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Anti-establishment and populist movements grew [around the world](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/05/economic-woe-trump-style-movements-created-worldwide) following the [global financial crisis](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-great-recession-influenced-todays-populist-movements) and often exist irrespective of who is in power, thus Obama cannot be blamed for their growth in the US.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: 2016 also saw an increase in the popularity of anti-establishment candidates throughout [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/across-europe-distrust-of-mainstream-political-parties-is-on-the-rise). This is illustrative of the fact that anti-establishment sentiment arose globally from some external factor, and not necessarily from Obama's presidency.
1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Both [Trump and Bernie Sanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/national/rise-of-the-anti-establishment-presidential-candidates/1822/?) ran on anti-establishment platforms and gained significant support from a wide range of Americans.
1.3.5.2. Pro: During his presidency the Democrats [failed to win](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/04/469052020/the-democratic-party-got-crushed-during-the-obama-presidency-heres-why) hundreds of elected positions, which suggests that Obama failed to keep voters on side.
1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Over the course of Obama's presidency, the Democrats lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than [under any other president.](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/04/469052020/the-democratic-party-got-crushed-during-the-obama-presidency-heres-why)
1.3.5.2.2. Con: The Democrats' loss of seats were due to [factors outside Obama's control](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/04/469052020/the-democratic-party-got-crushed-during-the-obama-presidency-heres-why) and were not necessarily indicative of his popularity.
1.3.5.2.2.1. Pro: The [gerrymandering done by the Republican party in 2010](https://www.vox.com/conversations/2016/10/5/13097066/gerrymandering-redistricting-republican-party-david-daley-karl-rove-barack-obama) has harmed the Democratic Party's chances at winning seats ever since.
1.3.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Successful gerrymandering by the Republican party [resulted in them winning almost 700 seats](https://www.vox.com/conversations/2016/10/5/13097066/gerrymandering-redistricting-republican-party-david-daley-karl-rove-barack-obama) at the state level.
1.3.5.2.2.1.2. Con: The Republicans were successful in redrawing districts because they won more seats at a state level [in the 2010 midterms.](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2016/07/19/gerrymandering-republicans-redmap) The fact that the Democrats were not as successful suggests they failed to appeal to voters.
1.3.5.2.2.2. Pro: [Those](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/04/469052020/the-democratic-party-got-crushed-during-the-obama-presidency-heres-why) who vote in midterm and gubernatorial elections tend to be older, less ethnically diverse, more religious, and more rural than those who vote in the presidential election. These are all features which make a person more likely to vote for a Republican than a Democrat.
1.3.5.2.2.3. Pro: The broader Democratic party grew [complacent](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9565119/democrats-in-deep-trouble) during Obama's term, failing to reach out to and connect with voters.
1.3.5.3. Con: Most presidents have [performed worse in elections](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/10/14211994/obama-democrats-downballot) once they are in power. Obama's loss of votes was to be expected and is not reflective of how good or bad his presidency was.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: According to research, post-war U.S. elections show a strong pattern of “incumbency disadvantage” whereby a party which has been in power for a long period tends to [lose](https://www.econ.upenn.edu/system/files/2019-04/wp19-07.pdf) popularity in a subsequent election. \(P.1, 2019\)
1.3.6. Pro: Obama failed to build a functioning relationship with the Republican Party during his presidency.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.3.6.2. Con: The [majority of Republicans](https://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx) approved of how Obama handled his job as president for a significant amount of his time in office.
1.3.6.3. Pro: The [majority](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-partisan/) of Obama's main accomplishments were the result of executive orders or party-line voting, not bipartisan consensus.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.3.6.3.3. Con: Republican politicians are just as much, if not more, to blame for the lack of bipartisanship during Obama's tenure.
1.3.6.3.3.1. Pro: Republicans used [dirty tactics](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/republicans-democracy-play-dirty.html) to prevent Obama achieving his goals.
1.3.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: The GOP [attempted](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-gops-dirty-war-197580/) to obstruct almost every proposal that was part of the Obama administration's agenda for his first two years in office, with the intention to paralyse the government and increase the chances of a Republican victory in the 2010 midterm elections.
1.3.6.3.3.1.2. Pro: When Republicans [lost control](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/republicans-democracy-play-dirty.html) of the North Carolina and Wisconsin governorships in 2016 and 2018, they used [lame-duck](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/lame_duck_session.htm) legislative sessions to pass a number of bills which stripped the incoming Democratic governors of power.
1.3.6.3.3.1.3. Pro: Obama [needed Senate approval](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now?t=1571856383640) to appoint Justice Garland and the Republican Party were in the majority in the Senate. The Republicans chose to not to consent to the nomination, and to deny Obama any chance of appointing a Supreme Court Justice.
1.3.6.3.3.2. Pro: According to Obama, the reason for the lack of bipartisan support was because Republicans were [unwilling to compromise](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-partisan/) on their ideals.
1.3.6.3.3.2.1. Pro: Statistics show that [around 66%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/20/republicans-are-cool-with-compromise-just-not-with-president-obama/) of Republican voters prefer for their leaders to "stand up" to Obama rather than compromising.
1.3.6.3.3.3. Pro: In 2010, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that his [top goal](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40007802/ns/politics-decision_2010/t/gop-leaders-top-goal-make-obama--term-president/) was to make Obama a one-term president, and that he would do so by refusing to cooperate with him and actively trying to repeal any of his policies.
1.3.6.3.3.3.1. Pro: Senate Republicans staunchly opposed a number of Obama's policies, despite the fact that they were the [very same policies](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-gops-dirty-war-197580/) they had advocated for under President Bush.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: Obama used [executive orders](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/federal-adaptation-resources/executive-orders-and-policies) in order to implement climate change policies, despite the fact that there was little bipartisan [support](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-partisan/) for them.
1.3.6.4. Pro: Obama [failed to appoint](https://www.thedailybeast.com/will-obama-ever-fess-up-to-his-merrick-garland-mess) Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court bench, as he was unable to gain Republican support for the nomination.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: It was in the interest of the Republican party to halt any SCOTUS nomination until after the 2016 election, when they may have had the [opportunity](https://www.npr.org/2016/09/06/492857860/173-days-and-counting-gop-unlikely-to-end-blockade-on-garland-nomination-soon) to appoint a conservative nomination. There is little Obama could have done to remove this incentive.
1.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.3.1.3.
1.3.6.4.1.2. Pro: Obama picked Justice Garland because he had traits and a history that he felt would appeal to Republican Senators. [His selection was a concession in itself](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/merrick-garland-supreme-court/index.html), which suggests there is little more that Obama could have done to have him appointed.
1.3.6.4.1.3. Con: The decision to halt nominations [was not clearly in the Republican Party's interests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/05/why-mitch-mcconnell-is-bragging-about-holding-up-merrick-garland-from-the-supreme-court-two-years-later/) at the time. Had the stalling been unsuccessful, the party could have lost the presidency, the Senate and the pro-conservative Supreme Court.
1.4. Con: Obama was a foreign policy failure.
1.4.1. Pro: Many of Obama's foreign policies were unethical.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Despite speaking of the importance of democratic values, the Obama administration did little to prevent - and may even have lent support to - a coup of the [democratically elected](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/us-role-honduras-coup-and-subsequent-violence) president of Honduras.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Hillary Clinton](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.html), who was part of the Obama administration, admitted to using her power to make sure that President Zelaya did not return to office, thereby facilitating the coup.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: In 2009, Obama described the coup as "[illegal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-honduras-usa-sb/obama-says-coup-in-honduras-is-illegal-idUKTRE55S5J220090629)" and reaffirmed that Zelaya remained the President of Honduras since he was democratically elected. In so doing, Obama confirmed the importance of democratic values.
1.4.1.2. Pro: There was a lack of [transparency](https://www.aclu.org/blog/obama-promised-transparency-drones-were-still-dark) over Obama's use of drones, which left many Americans unaware of how much destruction they were causing. This raises questions about the ethical nature of Obama's foreign policy.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Obama tried to [strengthen ties](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/obama-and-asia) between the US and China in order to increase the prosperity of the two nations, despite the fact that China was becoming an aggressor in East Asia, and had a [worsening](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/china-and-tibet) human rights record.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Obama attempted to deepen relations with China in order to [constrain](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/obama-failed-asian-pivot-china-ascendant) their aggressive behaviour, not to bolster it.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: The Chinese government accepts that human rights abuses like [child labour](https://borgenproject.org/10-facts-about-child-labor-in-china/) are at the heart of its competitive export economy. Therefore, by strengthening economic ties with China, Obama was content to let America indirectly benefit from human suffering.
1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: The problem of child labour has been significantly [mitigated](https://clb.org.hk/content/china-sees-progress-tackling-child-labour-problems-remain) by the Chinese government over the past decade.
1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: [According](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1630061X) to research from 2010, almost 8% of children in China aged from 10 to 15 were working 7 hours a day.
1.4.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Child labour participation has [been](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1630061X) positively correlated with the school dropout rate, meaning that those who are caught in child labour are likely to be denied the opportunity to access education.
1.4.1.4. Con: Foreign policy and international diplomacy are complex and intricate, requiring large amounts of compromise and concessions. It is impossible to expect every foreign policy interaction of a president to be ethically sound.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: In foreign policy, it is often necessary to cooperate with those you disagree with in order to [improve the world](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/03/why-do-we-cooperate/) or the way in which rogue actors conduct themselves.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: By cooperating and developing strong economic ties with countries around the world, the US has been able to [use](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/how-the-us-has-made-a-weapon-of-the-dollar/articleshow/65715068.cms?from=mdr) those economic relationships to [influence](https://www.france24.com/en/20180824-ukraine-bolton-says-us-sanctions-stay-until-russia-changes-behaviour) and dictate the behaviour of others.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: Whenever the US has attempted to push its liberal values on other international actors, it has [attracted](https://www.hoover.org/research/moral-core-us-foreign-policy) immense hostility.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: There are [many](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/11/is-america-incapable-of-conducting-a-moral-foreign-policy/) foreign policy actions which do not require compromise but simply a domestic moral consensus. The US failed to take the moral high ground on these issues during the Obama administration.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: Fostering good relations with large, world-dominant economies such as China is vital for the USA. In order to achieve this, Obama and any US president would have no choice but to [overlook](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/china-and-tibet) worsening human rights abuses in such countries.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Trade with China is integral for US economic growth.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: China [purchased](https://www.uschina.org/reports/understanding-us-china-trade-relationship) $165 billion in goods and services from the United States in 2015; by 2030, exports to China are expected to rise up to $520 billion.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Import of competitively-priced Chinese goods has been [estimated](https://www.uschina.org/reports/understanding-us-china-trade-relationship) to save the average American household approximately $850 a year.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1.3. Pro: Trade with China has been [linked](https://www.uschina.org/reports/understanding-us-china-trade-relationship) to the creation of 2.6 million American jobs and $216 billion of GDP.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1.4. Con: The [devastating impact](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/25/perspectives/china-trade-war-trump-winning/index.html) of the recent trade war on China demonstrates that China needs the US more than the US needs China.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1.5. Con: China is [not](https://qz.com/1682861/mexico-is-now-americas-number-one-trading-partner/) even one of the top 10 trading partners of the United States, as of 2019.
1.4.1.4.2.1.1.6. Pro: China is the [USA's third largest](https://www.industryweek.com/economy/us-needs-china-more-china-needs-us) - and most rapidly growing - export market.
1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: A hard stance on issues such as torture would be a clear basis at which to make policy decisions from.
1.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: Genocide is universally condemned. Having a red line on this issue would have a moral consensus.
1.4.1.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.6.
1.4.2. Con: Obama was able to reach out to and create new allies for the US.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Under Obama's leadership, the US was one of 5 UN Security Council members to successfully negotiate the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/122460/full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal.pdf) \(JCPOA\) with Iran, significantly impacting both international security and US-Iranian relations for the better.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Many people considered the Iran deal a failure.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Critics](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18760675/democratic-debate-2020-iran-deal-book) argued that it was wrong to increase trade and relations with Iran while they were still state-sponsors of terrorism and violence in the Middle East - something the Iran deal did not attempt to change.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Some - such as Israeli [Prime Minister Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/netanyahu-accuses-iran-cheating-nuclear-deal) - claimed that Iran were continuously violating their deal, yet the US still continued to increase relations and ease sanctions on them.
1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: Much of the criticism of Obama's Iran deal was not that it was a failure, but simply that it was [imperfect](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18760675/democratic-debate-2020-iran-deal-book).
1.4.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: All candidates bar one in the 2020 Democratic primary said that they would [rejoin](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18760675/democratic-debate-2020-iran-deal-book) the Iran deal.
1.4.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Many Democratic candidates who have signalled their support for the Iran Deal [want](https://www.cfr.org/article/presidential-candidates-iran-nuclear-deal) to make substantive revisions to it.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: At the time of the signing of the deal, Iran was one of the biggest [threats](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-importance-of-the-iran-agreement/) to international security, and the Iran deal limited their power.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The Trans-Pacific Partnership \(TPP\), an accord solidified in the Obama administration, created [several trade allies](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/economy/trade) for the US in the Asia-Pacific Rim, bringing numerous economic and trade benefits.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: The TPP [facilitated](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/world/asia/the-trans-pacific-trade-deal-and-a-presidents-legacy.html) US alliances and trade by creating a free-trade zone, lowering tariffs, outlining rules for resolving trade disputes, setting patents, and protecting the intellectual property of all signatories.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: An independent analysis of the TPP predicted it would [increase](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/business/international/trans-pacific-pact-would-lift-us-incomes-but-not-jobs-overall-study-says.html) incomes, exports and growth in the United States.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: The Trans-Pacific Partnership unnecessarily antagonised China.
1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: The Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama pushed for, though arguably antagonistic, was a policy that could have acted as a crucial [obstacle](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/business/tpp-explained-what-is-trans-pacific-partnership.html) to China's growing regional influence in Asia.
1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: The Trans-Pacific Partnership was described by Obama himself as allowing "America - and [not countries like China](https://www.yahoo.com/news/pacific-rim-nations-sign-us-led-trade-deal-234210619--finance.html?ref=gs&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVkaXBsb21hdC5jb20vMjAxNy8wMS90aGUtcGl2b3QtdG8tYXNpYS13YXMtb2JhbWFzLWJpZ2dlc3QtbWlzdGFrZS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANK4OLyxfZBIPM64-o1GLJap8pWuCKwmSh640R6YpUqh3x4c9PlYKqJ2rinnkKClecYbm53r26htuJUk55x2ajZY07tZTGuVo1bFiPYh7OF7nyH4SmIitM7GqL-AQJggeJshSNeBBLiyKjwUeGmwgxuJiSR9leO7lA3MM7LHmchh) - to write the rules of the road in the 21st century".
1.4.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.
1.4.2.3. Pro: By the end of Obama's tenure as president, the United States had finally been able to ally itself [with Latin America](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/08/latin-america-united-states-donald-trump-right-wing).
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Obama's [War on Drugs](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/03/us-war-on-drugs-impact-in-latin-american) policies caused significant damage to the countries and people of Latin America.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Despite inheriting a violent legacy, Obama significantly [reshaped](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/12/19/13903532/obama-war-on-drugs-legacy) the American war on drugs, from a punitive justice and militaristic issue, to a public health concern.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The number of people incarcerated in the US [dropped for the first time in over three decades](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/6/14189862/obama-mass-incarceration-prison) during Obama's term. A significant contributor to this decline was the Obama administration's instruction and encouragement for more lenient sentences to be given out for drug crimes.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Obama administration's '[Smart on Crime Initiative](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/6/14189862/obama-mass-incarceration-prison)' instructed federal prosecutors to charge and imprison fewer low-level drug offenders.
1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Mexico and Honduras have [been](https://www.zedbooks.net/blog/posts/honduras-obama-drugs-war/) significantly debilitated by the Obama administration's war on drugs.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Obama reversed a multi-generational trend by normalizing relations with Cuba, a [move](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/obama-and-latin-america) which was welcomed by fellow Latin American leaders.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: Obama became the [first](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/20/obama-havana-cuba-1224370) US President to visit Cuba since 1928 and since Fidel Castro's insurgency against the pro US regime in 1959.
1.4.2.4. Con: Obama's [Pivot to Asia](https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/04/what-exactly-does-it-mean-that-the-us-is-pivoting-to-asia/274936/) was a [failure](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/obama-failed-asian-pivot-china-ascendant).
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Obama's policy of "[strategic patience](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/02/14/obamas-strategic-patience-on-north-korea-is-turning-into-strategic-neglect/)" towards North Korea allowed the Kim regime to develop its nuclear weapons program and conduct more than [70 missile tests](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/) with minimal repercussions.
1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: Obama can hardly be blamed for this lack of progress since there [have not been any good options](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-missiles-sanctions.html) to deal with North Korea's nuclear program for many years.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: As part of his Asian Pivot, Obama facilitated rapprochement with [Myanmar](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/obama-economic-sanctions-myanmar-161007215716882.html) by lifting 20-year-old US economic sanctions on the country in recognition of its substantial advances to promote democracy.
1.4.2.4.3. Pro: The Pivot [antagonised](https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/the-pivot-to-asia-was-obamas-biggest-mistake/) Beijing and worsened United States–China relations.
1.4.2.4.3.1. Pro: The roll-out of the [Air-Sea Battle doctrine](https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=63730) in the Asian Pacific was interpreted by Beijing as a [hostile](https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/the-pivot-to-asia-was-obamas-biggest-mistake/) US effort to contain China militarily.
1.4.2.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.3.
1.4.2.4.3.3. Pro: When the U.S. was invited by China to join their Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \(AIIB\) in 2015, the Obama administration [refused](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/13/white-house-pointedly-asks-uk-to-use-its-voice-as-part-of-chinese-led-bank) to participate, and allegedly persuaded nations such as Australia not to join.
1.4.2.4.3.4. Con: During a 2013 [speech](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/11/remarks-tom-donilon-national-security-advisor-president-united-states-an) on the Asian Pivot, Obama's National Security Advisor stated clearly that the Pivot's policies "reject\[ed\]" calls to contain China, and that Obama was, rather, engaging with China at an "unprecedented pace \[...\] to build a constructive bilateral relationship".
1.4.2.4.4. Pro: [Critics](https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/the-pivot-to-asia-was-obamas-biggest-mistake/) have expressed that the Pivot to Asia may have triggered the U.S.' [deprioritisation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26270763?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) \(p.1\) of the Middle East and Europe, which had detrimental impacts.
1.4.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.
1.4.2.4.5. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.2.4.6. Pro: Obama [lost the support](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/obama-failed-asian-pivot-china-ascendant) of Duterte and the Philippines - who switched sides to supporting China's maritime efforts in the South China Sea instead of backing the US - because of Obama's criticisms of human rights abuses in the region.
1.4.2.4.7. Con: Obama's pivot to Asia was [able](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/20193/has-obama-s-pivot-to-asia-been-a-success-or-failure) to bring Vietnam onboard as a new ally, while positive relationships with other key Asian partners - such as India and South Korea - continued.
1.4.2.4.8. Pro: Obama's [lack of resistance](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/06/18/obama-weak-south-china-sea/) to Beijing's incursions in the South China Sea enabled China to gain power and control over the region.
1.4.2.4.8.1. Con: There were [not](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-pivot-asia-china-aggression-20160522-snap-story.html) many practical, risk-free steps that Obama could have taken to resist this: if the U.S. had started a war or occupied islands in the South China Sea itself, this may have exacerbated tensions and therefore drastic action on China's part.
1.4.2.4.8.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.3.1.
1.4.2.4.8.3. Pro: Despite China's actions breaking international law, Obama repeatedly took actions to [de-escalate tensions](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/06/18/obama-weak-south-china-sea/), as opposed to holding Beijing accountable for their actions.
1.4.3. Pro: Obama's foreign policy decisions intensified the threat of terrorism rather than reduced it.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Drone strikes - one of Obama's main policies for combating terrorism - furthered the threat of terrorism, as extremists used them and their indiscriminate killing as a [recruitment tool](http://blogs.reuters.com/david-rohde/2013/05/24/obamas-overdue-step-on-drones/).
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Standard warfare and putting troops on the ground would likely lead to more death and destruction than targeted drone strikes, and hence would have created more anti-US sentiment and propaganda for extremists.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: The indiscriminate and secretive nature of Obama's drone strikes [bolstered](http://blogs.reuters.com/david-rohde/2013/05/24/obamas-overdue-step-on-drones/) Jihadist conspiracy theories that the US' goal was to kill Muslims, innocent or otherwise. This encouraged anti-Americanism that extremists could use to garner greater civilian support.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: In a YouGov-Cambridge university poll conducted in 2011, [74%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/may/06/osama-bin-laden-dead-live-blog) of Pakistani respondents believed the US government did not respect Islam and considered itself at war with the Muslim world.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: Former FBI Director, James Comey, claimed that the [use of drones](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2016/08/09/obamas_drone_warfare_makes_more_terrorists_than_it_kills_109683.html) during the Obama administration created more terrorists than it stopped.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The Obama administration has been accused of either directly or indirectly financing terrorist groups.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: The Obama administration [approved a grant](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-isra-terrorism-funding/) of $200,000 to a Sudan-based group that is strongly affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: $1.7 billion that Obama handed over to Iran has [ended up](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/7/inside-the-ring-obama-era-cash-traced-to-iran-back/) in the hands of terrorist groups.
1.4.3.3.3. Pro: The Obama administration funded the Palestinian government, [despite its links](https://aclj.org/radical-islam/88-senators-gravely-concerned-over-obama-administration-funding-of-hamas-terrorist-led-palestinian-government) with the alleged terrorist group, Hamas.
1.4.3.4. Con: Obama's administration financed several counter-terrorist initiatives during his time in office.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Obama gave $860 million in aid for Pakistan, of which [$265 million](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/obama-administration-proposes-860-million-in-aid-for-pakistan/articleshow/50928170.cms) was specifically for assisting its anti-terrorist efforts.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: The Obama administration gave around $92.4 million in [aid to Kenya](https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2015/08/06/kenya-gets-us-funds-for-counterterror-war/) for the specific purpose of fighting terrorism.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: Obama's $5 billion anti-terrorist fund has actually been accused of increasing terrorism, since the [money given](http://bostonreview.net/blog/alex-de-waal-obamas-5-billion-counterterrorism-fund) to train anti-terrorist forces in West Africa has contributed to corruption, conflict, and the growth of police states.
1.4.4. Pro: The Obama administration has repeatedly failed in the Middle East.
1.4.4.1. Con: In 2011, Osama Bin Laden - a founder and then-leader of al-Qaeda - was successfully [assassinated](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/may-1-2011-president-obama-announces-bin-laden-s-death-677792323587) by US forces under the Obama administration. This significantly weakened the most notorious terrorist network in the Middle East.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: An investigator at the National Center for the Study of Terrorism and the Response to Terrorism predicted that Bin Laden's assassination would lead to even [greater fragmentation](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/09/bin-laden) of the already decentralised al-Qaeda, making it more difficult for the network to organise and orchestrate transnational terrorist attacks in both the Middle East and elsewhere.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Richard Clarke, President George Bush's counter-terrorism chief until 2003, said in the aftermath of Bin Laden's death that it had [symbolised a removal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-36127770) of al-Qaeda headquarters, effacing it as a multinational organisation.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: Some case studies show that successful assassinations of high-profile figures like Bin Laden have [no decisive effect](https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/05/five-years-after-the-death-of-osama-bin-laden-is-the.html) on the terrorist organizations they led before their death, with some even suggesting [increases in terrorist attacks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332735501_The_heterogeneous_repercussions_of_killing_Osama_bin_Laden_on_global_terrorism_patterns) following Bin Laden's death due to possible backlash effects \[p.4.\]
1.4.4.1.4. Con: In a YouGov-Cambridge University poll conducted after Bin Laden's death in the 3 main cities of Pakistan, [75%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/may/06/osama-bin-laden-dead-live-blog) of the respondents disapproved of US actions in hunting Bin Laden on Pakistani soil.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.4.3. Pro: The Obama administration's increase in the use of [drones](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush) was ineffective and caused significant harm.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: [Thousands](https://www.pri.org/stories/if-obama-apologized-1-civilian-drone-victim-every-day-it-would-take-him-3-years) of innocent civilians died in US drone strikes on Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: Drones often [targeted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/07/obama-adviser-criticises-drone-policy) mosques and funeral-precessions, in a blatant attempt to attack non-combatants and civilians.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Obama [ineffectively](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/middle-east-egypt-us-policy/409537/) handled the Arab Spring.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Indecisiveness, unwillingness to lead and lack of clarity in defining the objectives in dealing with the Arab Spring are amongst the [biggest criticisms](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-obama-administration-and-the-arab-spring/) of Obama.
1.4.4.4.1.1. Pro: Obama's [delay in action](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/middle-east-egypt-us-policy/409537/) with regards the uprisings of Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring have been criticized for exacerbating said conflicts.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Obama's actions in [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/epic-failure-of-our-age-how-west-failed-syria) had disastrous consequences.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: [Leaked audio recordings](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/10/obama-hoped-to-use-isis-as-leverage-against-assad-/)(Although some details of the meeting have been reported, little attention has been paid to Mr. Kerry’s discussion about a strategy to use the terrorist group’s growing presence in Syria and Iraq as leverage to pressure Mr. Assad. \[...\] The State Department on Tuesday forcefully denied any suggestion that the administration ever had a policy of tolerating or trying to use the group, also known as ISIS and ISIL. But Mr. Kerry’s comments, which drew fresh scrutiny in the Arab media last week, raise questions about the extent to which the administration sought to gain from the terrorist group’s prominence to force Mr. Assad to capitulate.) from meetings between Obama's Secretary of State, John Kerry, and Syrian activists may indicate that the Obama Administration deliberately allowed ISIS to grow stronger in Syria as a war strategy against the Syrian president.
1.4.4.5.2. Pro: Despite stating that Assad's use of chemical weapons against his own people would [cross a 'red-line'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/epic-failure-of-our-age-how-west-failed-syria) after which the US would have to intervene, Obama failed to act when Assad killed more than 1,000 civilians through the use of sarin gas.
1.4.5. Pro: The Obama administration created strains in the relationships between the US and its allies at the time.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and the UAE signaled a negative shift in their relations with the US over the Obama administration's [policies regarding](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/obama-isolated-anger-builds-us-allies) Iran and Syria.
1.4.5.2. Pro: France, Mexico, Brazil and [Germany](http://telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10407282/Barack-Obama-approved-tapping-Angela-Merkels-phone-3-years-ago.html) questioned and [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/obama-isolated-anger-builds-us-allies) the Obama administration of surveillance and phone tapping, which strained the relations of the US with said countries.
1.4.5.3. Con: Obama [strengthened](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/06/29/as-obama-years-draw-to-close-president-and-u-s-seen-favorably-in-europe-and-asia/) key alliances in Western Europe that had been weakened during the George Bush era.
1.4.5.4. Pro: Relations between the US and Israel were [weakened](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/bibi-obama/) during the Obama administration.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: From 2014 to 2015, Israeli [public approval](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/) of Obama fell from 71% to 49%, in large part due to the tense relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, and the US's growing relationship with Iran.
1.4.6. Con: 15 out of 16 countries that were polled by the Pew Research Center [had favourable views](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/06/29/as-obama-years-draw-to-close-president-and-u-s-seen-favorably-in-europe-and-asia/) of the Obama administration.
1.4.6.1. Con: The countries polled, the majority of which are developed western nations, may not accurately represent the overall perception of the Obama administration held by foreigners globally.
1.4.7. Con: The Obama administration showed a strong commitment towards developing countries.
1.4.7.1. Con: Obama's actions towards [Libya](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/02/17/obama-destroyed-libya) during his presidency arguably led to its political, economic and social ruin.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Obama [increased](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/01/19/obama-stakes-his-africa-legacy-on-economic-growth/#374b322a1289) trade with, and investment in, many developing countries in Africa.
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: A major stumbling block to development in parts of Africa is a lack of access to energy. Through his [Power Africa Initiative](https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica), Obama [secured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/01/19/obama-stakes-his-africa-legacy-on-economic-growth/#374b322a1289) over $54 billion in global commitments with the goal of doubling energy access.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: Obama's [Young African Leaders Initiative](https://yali.state.gov/) was set up to provide financial and structural support to young African entrepreneurs and businesspeople.
1.4.7.2.3. Pro: Obama encouraged American businesses to invest in Africa and African companies. This resulted in the American [Overseas Private Investment Corporation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/01/19/obama-stakes-his-africa-legacy-on-economic-growth/#374b322a1289) tripling its portfolio in Africa since 2009 - committing $7 billion in finance and insurance, and encouraging another $14 billion in investments.
1.4.7.2.4. Con: The Obama administration's failure to follow up on their promises to support pro-democratic institutions in Africa has [led](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/03/opinions/obama-failed-in-africa-tampa-opinion/index.html) to the curbing of civil liberties and increased authoritarianism in many countries in the region.
1.4.7.2.5. Con: Oil imports from African countries to the United States significantly [dropped](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/impact-u-s-shale-boom-africa) during the Obama administration's tenure, due to an increased focus on domestic production of shale oil.
1.4.7.3. Pro: Obama committed [billions of dollars](https://globalhealth.org/president-obama-releases-global-health-initiative-request/) to a Global Health Initiative \(GHI\), which [bolsters](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44727.html) global health systems and develops the US's rapid response to global health crises.
1.4.7.4. Pro: During his presidency, Obama [committed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/barack-obama-transfers-500m-to-green-climate-fund-in-attempt-to-protect-paris-deal) significant amounts of money to help [developing countries fight climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/14/barack-obama-to-pledge-at-least-25bn-to-help-poor-countries-fight-climate-change).
1.4.7.4.1. Pro: Obama pledged around $3 billion at the [G20 Summit](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/14/barack-obama-to-pledge-at-least-25bn-to-help-poor-countries-fight-climate-change) in 2014 to assist developing countries in fighting climate change.
1.4.7.4.2. Con: At the same time, Obama [did little](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/4/28/15472508/obama-climate-change-legacy-overrated-clean-power) to further the fight on climate change in the US, which means that developing countries will still suffer from ramifications of US complacency on tackling global warming.
1.4.7.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.4.7.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.4.7.4.3. Pro: The Global Climate Change Initiative [launched](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/Climate_Fact_Sheet.pdf) by the Obama administration provided considerable technical and financial support to low-income countries to improve the capacity for climate adaptation.
1.4.7.5. Con: Obama has come under criticism for significantly [expanding](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/18/barack-obama-was-a-foreign-policy-failure/) the scope of the Bush 'War on Terror' through greatly increased use of drones in conflict zones.
1.4.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.7.5.2. Pro: More [than](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/drone-war) 1,000 civilians - including 300 children - have been killed by US drone strikes.
1.4.7.6. Con: Obama's failure to recognise the [resilience](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/18/barack-obama-was-a-foreign-policy-failure/) of authoritarian states and the ability of violent extremists to exploit power vacuums resulted in great devastation for developing countries in the Middle East during the Arab Spring.
1.4.7.6.1. Pro: Obama's failure to [take quick action](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/epic-failure-of-our-age-how-west-failed-syria) has often been cited as the cause for the worsening of the Syrian conflict.
1.4.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.
1.5. Pro: Obama improved the economy of America.
1.5.1. Pro: In 2009, Obama introduced a [$787 billion economic stimulus package](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-obama-s-stimulus-package-3305625) to end the Great Recession and boost economic growth.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Following the economic stimulus package, GDP grew from 1.4% to [3.8%](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-obama-s-stimulus-package-3305625) for the fourth quarter in 2009.
1.5.1.2. Pro: In the first quarter of 2009, before the economic stimulus package was introduced, there was a 4.4% drop in the economy. However, by the fourth quarter the [economy had grown by 4.5%](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-obama-s-stimulus-package-3305625), indicating that the economic stimulus played a pivotal role in the improvement.
1.5.1.3. Con: Obama's economic stimulus package [failed to achieve](https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama8217s-stimulus-five-years-later-1392640078) its own goal of keeping unemployment down by 8% over the years that followed.
1.5.1.4. Con: Obama's economic stimulus package was [unsuccessful](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/opinion/sunday/how-the-stimulus-fell-short.html) in bringing about a sustainable, strong economic recovery.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: According to some economists, Obama's stimulus package [led](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhendrickson/2016/08/26/debunking-government-stimulus/#43696a214554) to the weakest recovery from a recession in history.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: The so-called bedrock of the economic stimulus package was to create ['shovel-ready' projects](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/opinion/sunday/how-the-stimulus-fell-short.html) that would put people in work right away. However, Obama later said there were "no such thing" when in fact there were viable options for such projects. As a result, the stimulus did not overcome the effects of the European debt crisis and rising gas prices in 2010.
1.5.1.4.2. Con: It is unfair to blame Obama wholly for the harmful repercussions of the stimulus spending, as many of these stimulus programs [were launched](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhendrickson/2016/08/26/debunking-government-stimulus/#43696a214554) by his predecessor, President Bush, towards the end of his presidency.
1.5.1.5. Pro: The economic stimulus package saved or created around [2 million jobs](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/barack-obama/obama-says-stimulus-responsible-millions-jobs-save/) by the fourth quarter of 2009.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: A figure of 2 million jobs saved or created is a [generous interpretation](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/barack-obama/obama-says-stimulus-responsible-millions-jobs-save/) of the data range, which estimated that between 800,000 and 2.4 million jobs were saved or created.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: Taking an average of all the independent estimates, only around [1.38 million](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/barack-obama/obama-says-stimulus-responsible-millions-jobs-save/) jobs were saved.
1.5.2. Con: Given that Obama [took office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama) only two months before the [American economy's nadir](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/04/the-10th-anniversary-of-the-climactic-march-2009-market-bottom-arrives-this-week.html), the improvement of the US economy during his tenure was almost inevitable.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The US economy was significantly [harmed](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-prexy.4.16321064.html) during the presidency of George Bush, Obama's predecessor; its improvement under the Obama Administration was thus almost a given.
1.5.3. Pro: Obama introduced [financial and banking regulation](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/7-key-points-obamas-regulatory-reform-a-1554) to protect the economy.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Obama introduced the [Dodd-Frank Act](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/9004155/dodd-frank-explainer) to stabilise banks and financial services providers, and improve their practices.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act introduced increased monitoring of large banks and insurance companies that [pose a risk to the entire banking system](https://www.thebalance.com/dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-act-3305688).
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: The [Financial Stability Oversight Committee monitors risk](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/about/Pages/default.aspx) in the financial industry by conducting research. It then makes recommendations or takes actions depending on the risks identified.
1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Financial Stability Oversight Committee [hands over](https://www.thebalance.com/dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-act-3305688) any larger, riskier firms to the Federal Reserve, which [closely monitors](https://www.thebalance.com/the-federal-reserve-system-and-its-function-3306001) and regulates these.
1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Federal Reserve makes banks increase their [reserve requirement](https://www.thebalance.com/reserve-requirement-3305883) if it is concerned about their liquidity, ensuring that they have enough money in their possession to [prevent bankruptcy](https://www.thebalance.com/dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-act-3305688).
1.5.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The Federal Reserve has [voted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/business/economy/federal-reserve-bank-regulations.html) to lighten restrictions on the vast majority of banks, making it less likely that these banks shall be closely monitored and regulated.
1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: The [Federal Insurance Office](https://www.thebalance.com/dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-act-3305688) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act. It gathers information about risks and trends in the insurance industry and monitors large companies.
1.5.3.1.1.3. Con: Some argue that the Dodd-Frank Act has [entrenched the position](http://www.valuesandcapitalism.com/after-5-years-of-dodd-frank-too-big-to-fail-is-bigger-than-ever/) of the biggest banks. This means that the risk they pose to the financial system has not been reduced.
1.5.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: If the position of a large bank is entrenched, then that means that if the bank were to go bankrupt it [would harm the entire economic system](http://www.valuesandcapitalism.com/after-5-years-of-dodd-frank-too-big-to-fail-is-bigger-than-ever/).
1.5.3.1.1.4. Con: The Dodd-Frank Act's introduction of increased regulatory monitoring was based on the [erroneous](http://www.valuesandcapitalism.com/after-5-years-of-dodd-frank-too-big-to-fail-is-bigger-than-ever/) idea that the financial crisis was caused by under-regulation, when instead it was caused by bad regulation.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: The Volcker Rule, a rule featured in the Dodd-Frank Act, has been [criticised](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-volcker-rule-is-still-a-bad-idea/) as being arbitrary and ineffective at eliminating investment risk.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: In August 2019, [the Volcker Rule was changed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/20/reuters-america-update-1-u-s-regulators-finalize-changes-easing-post-crisis-volcker-rule.html) after years of lobbying by banks for reform.
1.5.3.1.2.2. Con: The Volcker Rule [prevents banks](https://www.thebalance.com/volcker-rule-summary-3305905) from using their customers deposits for their own profit. This protects money belonging to customers.
1.5.3.1.2.3. Con: Banks responded to the introduction of the Volcker Rule by [reducing risk taking practices](https://www.lexisnexis.com/communities/corporatecounselnewsletter/b/newsletter/archive/2014/01/06/the-volcker-rule-s-impact-on-financial-institutions-and-companies.aspx).
1.5.3.1.2.3.1. Con: Critics [expressed concern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/12/13/the-volcker-rule-makes-us-safer-but-not-safe/#650537417216) that banks could just pay fines if they were caught taking risks that breached the Volcker Rule, thereby not effectively incentivising them to truly reduce risk taking practices.
1.5.3.1.2.3.2. Pro: In preparation for the introduction of the Volcker Rule, Goldman Sachs [closed two of its divisions](https://www.thebalance.com/volcker-rule-summary-3305905) that participated in risky investment.
1.5.3.1.2.4. Pro: The Volcker Rule creates an overly complex system of compliance. This system [distracts regulators and risk managers](https://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2019/9/22/the-costs-of-inefficient-regulation-the-volcker-rule) from other tasks that would make the financial system safer.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: [Critics claim](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/07/dodd-frank-reform-is-still-a-this-year-priority-rep-hensarling-says.html) that the Dodd-Frank Act is bad for the economy.
1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: The regulatory expansion introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act has [disproportionately impacted](http://www.valuesandcapitalism.com/after-5-years-of-dodd-frank-too-big-to-fail-is-bigger-than-ever/) smaller banks, thereby facilitating big banks to consolidate their market share.
1.5.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The organisation that produced this article aims to "advance a moral case for free enterprise". As such, it [ideologically opposes](http://www.valuesandcapitalism.com/about/) the sort of market regulation introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act. Therefore, its analysis of the impact of the Act on the economy is likely to be biased.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act introduced more regulation, which has negatively [impacted the profitability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258274008_The_Impact_of_the_Dodd-Frank_Act_on_Small_Banks) of smaller lenders. \(p.2\)
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: As part of increased regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act [increased compliance costs](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Peirce-Small-Bank-Survey-summary.pdf) for small banks.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act [imposed stricter compliance requirements](https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/8-years-later-the-damage-dodd-frank-continues-mount) for making loans. This made it more difficult and costly for smaller banks, who tend to give out smaller loans, to do so.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: A survey revealed that 90% of small banks had increased compliance costs under the Dodd-Frank Act, with 83% reporting increases of more than 5% \([Mercatus, p. 2](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Peirce-Small-Bank-Survey-summary.pdf)\).
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: The median number of compliance staff at small banks doubled under Dodd-Frank \([Mercatus, p. 2](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Peirce-Small-Bank-Survey-summary.pdf)\).
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Loss of profit of smaller lenders [can also be attributed to](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1526/the-effect-of-dodd-frank-on-the-profitability-of-community-banks-an-econometric-model) non-performing loans and the growth of total deposits, which are unrelated to the Dodd-Frank Act.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Since the second quarter of 2010, after the Dodd-Frank Act became law, small community banks have [lost double the amount of US commercial banking assets](http://www.valuesandcapitalism.com/after-5-years-of-dodd-frank-too-big-to-fail-is-bigger-than-ever/) compared to what they lost between 2006 and 2010.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.4. Con: Since 2010, community bank profitability has been on an [upward trajectory.](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/community-banking-alive-well-three-myths-about-dodd-frank-and-community-banks/)
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.4.1. Pro: The [percentage of community banks making a profit](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CLAIMS-AND-FACTS-FINAL.pdf) in 2016 was 95.7%, compared to 78% in 2010. \(p. 1\)
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.5. Con: The Dodd-Frank Act [mandated discounts for smaller banks](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CLAIMS-AND-FACTS-FINAL.pdf) which have resulted in savings and increased profitability.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: Between 2010 and 2016, small banks [saved $3.7 billion](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CLAIMS-AND-FACTS-FINAL.pdf) in deposit insurance fees as a result of provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act.
1.5.3.1.3.1.2.6. Pro: Small banks [cannot](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/05/23/how_dodd-frank_hurts_the_little_guy_110645.html) spread regulatory costs over a large portfolio of loans, nor hire the legal staff required to adapt to changing requirements.
1.5.3.1.3.1.3. Con: Some blame the [removal](https://fortune.com/2017/08/04/dodd-frank-choice-act/) of restrictions on multistate banking, and not the Dodd-Frank Act, for the decline of small banks, leading to dominance by big banks.
1.5.3.1.3.1.4. Con: Unlike small banks, big banks are able to [invest in advanced technology](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/05/02/techs-raid-on-the-banks) that allows them to improve their services and take up more of the market share. It is this, and not Dodd-Frank, that is allowing big banks to dominate the market.
1.5.3.1.3.1.5. Pro: The introduction of the Dodd-Frank Act decreased the [amount of investment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258274008_The_Impact_of_the_Dodd-Frank_Act_on_Small_Banks) received by smaller banks. \(p. 4\)
1.5.3.1.3.1.5.1. Con: The decreased amount of investment at the time of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act was [reflective of the state of the American economy](https://www.inc.com/bob-house/the-dodd-frank-act-debate-and-how-it-affects-small-business-owners.html) at the time, which was recovering from the global financial crisis. Investment has since increased.
1.5.3.1.3.1.6. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act has [forced many smaller banks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2015/07/24/dodd-frank-community-bank-decline-and-the-effect-on-u-s-cities-and-towns/#7fecda512d3f) to merge with larger banks or consolidate because they were unable to keep up with the demands of the legislation.
1.5.3.1.3.1.6.1. Pro: Since the Dodd-Frank Act, bigger banks have increased their market share by [36%](https://hotair.com/archives/ed-morrissey/2015/02/12/harvard-study-dodd-frank-actually-made-too-big-to-fail-even-bigger/).
1.5.3.1.3.1.6.2. Con: The trends of banks consolidating, closing and merging [were present before the Dodd-Frank Act](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CLAIMS-AND-FACTS-FINAL.pdf): it is a natural part of a changing economy. \(p. 1\)
1.5.3.1.3.1.6.2.1. Pro: Community banks have been on the [decline year-on-year since 1984](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CLAIMS-AND-FACTS-FINAL.pdf), with bank closures peaking before Dodd-Frank, not after \(p. 1\).
1.5.3.1.3.1.6.2.1.1. Con: Even though the peak for small bank closures occurred prior to Dodd-Frank, there have been [more bank closures a year on average](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CLAIMS-AND-FACTS-FINAL.pdf) after Dodd-Frank. \(p. 2\)
1.5.3.1.3.2. Con: The Dodd-Frank Act [prevents](https://searchfinancialsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Dodd-Frank-Act) future taxpayer-funded bailouts. This is good for taxpayers.
1.5.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act makes it [legally impossible](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/09/19/no-more-bailouts-lawmakers-behind-dodd-frank-say-taxpayers-won-t-foot-bill-next/) for the government to bail out banks.
1.5.3.1.3.2.2. Con: Regulators have warned that the biggest banks in the US are [still too big to fail](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/business/dealbook/living-wills-of-5-banks-fail-to-pass-muster.html) without causing large-scale financial chaos. This means that, in the case of their collapse, they would need to be bailed out by taxpayers.
1.5.3.1.3.3. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act [is bad for small businesses](https://www.cato.org/publications/research-briefs-economic-policy/impact-dodd-frank-act-small-business) and entrepreneurs.
1.5.3.1.3.3.1. Con: The Obama administration made up for any possible negative effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on small businesses by [giving tax breaks and loans](https://www.blackenterprise.com/obamas-legacy-in-supporting-small-businesses/) to small businesses.
1.5.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act has been [blamed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325632055_The_Impact_of_the_Dodd-Frank_Act_on_Small_Business/link/5c66b7ed299bf1d14cc90626/download) for a slowdown in small business formation. \(p. 1\)
1.5.3.1.3.3.3. Pro: Banks have imposed [higher standards for lending](https://www.cato.org/publications/research-briefs-economic-policy/impact-dodd-frank-act-small-business) to small businesses since the introduction of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1.5.3.1.3.3.4. Con: The Dodd-Frank Act has provisions specifically intended to aid small businesses.
1.5.3.1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Section 1071 of the DFA [instructs](https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/time-for-cfpb-to-move-forward-on-small-business-lending) the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to collect data on lending to small businesses, with the specific goal of better understanding the landscape for small businesses owned and operated by women and minorities.
1.5.3.1.3.4. Con: The Dodd-Frank Act allows for the economy to develop in a way that will [prevent a repeat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-dodd-frank-financial-regulations/2011/10/19/gIQAtq7j4L_story.html) of the damage done during the 2008 crash. This is good for the economy.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \(CFPB\), which [provides more information and power](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/01/04/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-101-why-we-need-consumer-watchdog) to consumers.
1.5.3.1.4.1. Con: Consumers may be skeptical of regulatory bodies such as the CFPB and thus unlikely to engage with or get help from them.
1.5.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [has given $12 billion to 29 million](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/what-is-the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-anyway) Americans affected by harmful financial products. It is unlikely that a person in need of help will choose not to rely on this body given how effective it has shown itself to be.
1.5.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: Many ordinary people, who were greatly affected by the global financial crisis, [blamed politicians and institutions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-regulation-consumers/consumers-skeptical-of-congress-on-regulation-idUSTRE64P4QF20100526) for the crash. As a result, many didn't trust the actions of politicians in responding to the crisis or the institutions that came about as a result of those actions.
1.5.3.1.4.1.3. Con: Americans [have shown an increasing preference](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/americans-dont-prefer-a-smaller-government-anymore_n_58ff3b1ae4b0288f5dc7d912) for 'big government' and expanding government services. Given that preference, it is unlikely that the majority of Americans are skeptical of regulatory bodies.
1.5.3.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Polling has suggested](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/consumers-support-strong-regulation-of-wall-street-poll-finds-071817.html) that Americans strongly support regulation of banking and financial services and the work of the CFPB.
1.5.3.1.4.1.3.2. Con: [Many people believe](https://www.scribd.com/doc/298600587/AAF-Memo-On-Dodd-Frank-Survey) that big government poses more of a threat to their finances than big banks.
1.5.3.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: Polling suggests that there is a huge amount of public support for [increased financial regulation.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/02/public-remains-divided-over-role-of-government-in-financial-regulation/)
1.5.3.1.4.1.3.2.2. Pro: A 2019 poll by Fox News [found](https://freebeacon.com/issues/poll-more-americans-fear-big-government-than-big-tech/) that 58% of Americans felt that big government was a bigger threat to America than powerful technology companies.
1.5.3.1.4.1.4. Pro: The CFPB has been [criticized](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/12/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-tragic-failures/) for being partisan and systematically excluding Republicans from decision-making processes. This is likely to make right-leaning voters skeptical of the Bureau's actions.
1.5.3.1.4.2. Pro: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [provides resources](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/) for citizens and responds to their questions and complaints regarding banks and financial institutions.
1.5.3.1.4.3. Pro: The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau [researches trends](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/01/04/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-101-why-we-need-consumer-watchdog) so that it can respond to and preempt possible harms to consumers.
1.5.3.1.4.4. Con: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is [unconstitutionally structured](https://www.ft.com/content/51d19be8-1302-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76). This means it poses a threat to consumers and businesses.
1.5.3.1.4.4.1. Pro: [Some Republicans claim](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=4460) that the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is a waste of public resources.
1.5.3.1.4.5. Con: Many other regulatory bodies such as Federal Reserve, SEC and Federal Trade Commission [already regulate banks](https://www.ft.com/content/51d19be8-1302-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76). The function of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is therefore redundant.
1.5.3.1.4.5.1. Pro: During the Obama administration, there was significant [overlap in the rule-making powers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-rules/fed-seeks-to-trim-rules-overlapping-with-u-s-consumer-bureau-idUSKBN1EC1W3) of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau \(CFPB\) and the Federal Reserve. Only after Obama's departure has there been a push by the Federal Reserve to roll back its own rule-making powers in the areas of mortgages and consumer leasing specifically in recognition of the CFPB.
1.5.3.1.4.5.2. Pro: Federal agencies [successfully prosecuted crimes against consumer protection](https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-undermines-economic-freedom) in the financial industry before the existence of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. The latter's role as a prosecutor was an unnecessary addition to the regulatory system.
1.5.3.1.4.5.3. Con: A review by the Offices of the Inspectors General found that there was [no duplication of work](https://oig.federalreserve.gov/reports/cfpb-responsibilities-coordination-review-jun2015.pdf) performed by the CFPB and other regulatory bodies \[p. 4\]. This suggests that the CFPB performs a unique function and is not redundant.
1.5.3.1.4.5.4. Con: The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau \(CFPB\) has [consolidated responsibility for consumer protection](https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/what-is-the-cfpb/) in one place, leading to more effective regulation.
1.5.3.1.4.5.4.1. Pro: [Prior to the creation](https://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/what-is-the-cfpb/) of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, there were seven regulatory bodies responsible for consumer protection regulation. According to the Obama adminstration, this led to weak and scattered financial policies that failed to protect consumers in the US during the global financial crisis.
1.5.3.1.4.6. Pro: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [holds businesses accountable](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) for breaches of consumer protection laws.
1.5.3.1.4.6.1. Pro: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [enforces financial regulations](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/enforcement/actions/) against businesses in breach of consumer protection law.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2. Con: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's policy of publishing complaint data has allowed public criticism of financial services firms without any recourse on the part of the company. This allows for firms to be [unfairly singled out](https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-cfpb-congress-target/complaints-against-wells-fargo-other-banks-rise-on-cfpb-log-targeted-by-congress-idUSKBN1685ND).
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.1. Pro: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau publishes complaints against financial services firms on their database [without verifying](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-treasure-trove-publication-of-73424/) the facts alleged in the complaints.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: The CFPB has gone to great lengths to [ensure](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-treasure-trove-publication-of-73424/) that the companies in question have an opportunity to respond to the 'public narrative' of the complaints.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.1.2. Pro: Companies have [registered](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/business/consumer-bureau-database.html) complaints regarding how publicly platforming unverified accusations against them by consumers has hurt their business interests.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.2. Con: Even if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's complaint database allows financial institutions to be unfairly singled out, it serves a public good, and so it can be justified on [public policy](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/PublicPolicy.aspx) grounds.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.2.1. Con: Sometimes banks are unable to respond to complaints in the CFPB database because [they can't make sense of them](https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-cfpb-congress-target/complaints-against-wells-fargo-other-banks-rise-on-cfpb-log-targeted-by-congress-idUSKBN1685ND). It is unfair for banks to be judged for complaints that they're unable to respond to.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.2.2. Con: The complaints shared in the CFPB database have been used against banks by lawyers fighting against banks in court and by regulators making cases against them. If the complaints system against banks [interferes with their access to justice](https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-cfpb-congress-target/complaints-against-wells-fargo-other-banks-rise-on-cfpb-log-targeted-by-congress-idUSKBN1685ND) then it is not in the public interest.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.2.3. Pro: The CFPB's complaints database allows voters and policy makers to [identify harmful trends](https://www.nclnet.org/defending_cfpb) in the financial services industry. This can inform the policies for reform that they vote for.
1.5.3.1.4.6.2.2.4. Pro: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's complaints database is searchable, meaning consumers can find [information on a product or a lender.](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-treasure-trove-publication-of-73424/) This allows consumers to make more informed decisions.
1.5.3.2. Con: Some of the financial and banking regulations introduced by Obama to deal with the 2009 financial crisis did [more harm](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/op-eds-and-articles/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/) than good to the economy.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Instead of adopting measures that allowed burden-sharing between banks and homeowners/borrowers, through some form of bankruptcy reform or debt relief, Obama decided to [prioritise the rights of creditors](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/op-eds-and-articles/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/) over the need to protect homeowners/borrowers.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: Obama's financial and banking policies failed to hold bank executives and other responsible individuals [accountable](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/op-eds-and-articles/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/) for their role in the 2009 financial crisis; having escaped liability then, these people are arguably more likely to commit such wrongs again.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: Obama's program designed to prevent foreclosures in fact led to roughly [9 million](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/op-eds-and-articles/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/) of them, hurting homeowners and helping banks in the process.
1.5.3.2.4. Pro: With a record wave of mergers and acquisitions in 2015, Obama's policies [failed to deal with monopolies](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/op-eds-and-articles/democrats-cant-win-until-they-recognize-how-bad-obamas-financial-policies-were/), leading to more concentrated power among few corporations.
1.5.3.2.5. Con: According to a [study](https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-financial-crisis-lessons-for-the-next-one), the 2009 financial crisis would have ended up hurting the US economy [even more](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/20/9571349/blinder-zandi-stimulus-bailout) if not for Obama's economic policies.
1.5.3.2.5.1. Pro: The decline in real GDP would have been closer to [14%](https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-financial-crisis-lessons-for-the-next-one) rather than the 4% which occurred.
1.5.3.2.5.2. Pro: The economy may have contracted for more than [three years](https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-financial-crisis-lessons-for-the-next-one), over twice as long as the actual period of contraction.
1.5.3.2.5.3. Pro: About [twice](https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-financial-crisis-lessons-for-the-next-one) as many jobs - an estimated 17 million - may have been lost. This may have meant unemployment peaking to almost 16%, rather than 10%.
1.5.3.2.5.4. Pro: The budget deficit may have grown to [$2.8 trillion](https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-financial-crisis-lessons-for-the-next-one) by 2011 i.e. more than 20% of the GDP instead of 10%.
1.5.3.2.5.5. Con: [According](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/18/bailout-financial-crisis-donald-trump-barack-obama-george-soros) to some experts, a much better bailout deal, ruled out by political considerations of the Obama administration, would have been possible.
1.5.3.2.6. Con: Even if Obama's economic policies were not that good in the long term, they were at least able to [immediately mitigate](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/06/01/432923/obamas-legacy-economy-anything-mess/) some of the most important economic harms resulting from the 2009 financial crisis.
1.5.3.2.7. Con: The source of much criticism against Obama's financial and banking regulations [stems from Republicans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/05/15/republicans-couldnt-possibly-be-more-hypocritical-about-economy/) who have an incentive to oppose the actions of a Democrat President.
1.5.3.3. Con: The fiduciary rule, introduced by Obama, [hurt investors](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/06/why-obamas-retirement-advice-rule-is-bad-for-investors-commentary.html), which in turn hurt the economy.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: The fiduciary rule [helps the average investor](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/dol-fiduciary-rule-what-will-it-mean-for-your-money/) as it makes financial advisors act in the interest of the investors that they are advising.
1.5.3.3.2. Pro: The fiduciary rule lead to [$14bn in losses](https://www.investmentnews.com/article/20180905/FREE/180909974/dol-fiduciary-rule-caused-14-billion-in-stock-losses-for-investment) for investment firms.
1.5.3.3.3. Pro: The fiduciary rule was [found to be overreaching](https://www.pionline.com/article/20180614/ONLINE/180619908/dol-declines-to-appeal-fiduciary-rule-decision-to-supreme-court) by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals which resulted in it being struck down.
1.5.3.3.4. Con: The fiduciary rule stopped financial institutions from giving advice to consumers [that wasn't in their best interests](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/how-the-new-fiduciary-rule-will-actually-affect-you.html). Creating this standard of care is good for the financial interests of consumers and therefore good for the economy.
1.5.4. Con: A lot of Obama's 'do good' concepts ended up as financial failures that are still felt today.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.5.4.3. Con: In his efforts to decrease economic inequality, Obama fought for and passed [permanent tax relief](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/04/14/tax-day-what-president-obama-has-done-make-tax-code-fairer) for nearly all working- and middle-class families.
1.5.4.4. Pro: [Solyndra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra#Government_support), a solar panel manufacturer granted a $535 million loan guarantee under Obama, was a monetary failure that has had a lingering negative impact on the US green energy industry.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: After 4 years of investigation, a report from the Inspector General’s Office concluded that Solyndra officials used [inaccurate information](https://fortune.com/2015/08/27/remember-solyndra-mistake/) to mislead the Department of Energy in its application for a loan. In this way, Obama's government is not entirely responsible for the monetary losses it suffered as a result of having agreed to fund an ultimately unsuccessful project.
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: Following Solyndra's 2011 collapse, the US Department of Energy issued [no new loans](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-doe-loans/exclusive-controversial-u-s-energy-loan-program-has-wiped-out-losses-idUSKCN0IX0A120141113) to fund green technologies until 2014.
1.5.4.4.3. Pro: Right-wing entities, such as media outlet [Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/07/23/delingpole-global-solar-industry-goes-up-in-flames/) and President [Donald Trump](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-hates-solar-energy-91224541e0d9/), have arguably used the failure of climate change initiatives like Solyndra to encourage climate change skepticism.
1.5.4.4.4. Con: After Solyndra defaulted on its loan in 2011, the Energy Loan Program that it had received funds from [started](https://www.npr.org/2014/11/13/363572151/after-solyndra-loss-u-s-energy-loan-program-turning-a-profit?t=1571838412654) turning over a profit less than three years later.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Many of Obama's education policies were ultimately unsuccessful and came at great financial cost.
1.5.4.5.1. Pro: The rate of student loan debt [increased faster](https://changematters.bankofthewest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/graph_studentloandebt_032516.jpg) under his presidency than before it.
1.5.4.5.1.1. Con: Obama made significant efforts to [decrease the effects](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/01/13/500421608/obamas-impact-on-americas-schools) of student loans in his tenure, including an income-based repayment plan, reducing the interest on Stafford Loans, and putting $50 billion into grants for low-income college students.
1.5.4.5.2. Con: Under Obama, the high school graduation rate hit an [all-time high](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/01/13/500421608/obamas-impact-on-americas-schools) of 83.2% in 2014 - 2015.
1.5.4.5.2.1. Con: Despite this increase being [cited by the Obama administration](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/05/the-rise-in-american-high-school-graduation-rates-looks-puffed-up) as ostensible proof of its education policies' success, many states with a remarkable increase in graduation rates during Obama's presidency have since admitted that their figures were [inflated](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/05/the-rise-in-american-high-school-graduation-rates-looks-puffed-up), often by highly questionable quick-fixes.
1.5.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Auditors examining Washington DC district records found that [34%](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/05/the-rise-in-american-high-school-graduation-rates-looks-puffed-up) of all diplomas in 2017 were improperly awarded.
1.5.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: During this time, [online credit recovery classes](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/06/10/412240568/raising-graduation-rates-with-questionable-quick-fixes) were increasingly used instead of summer schools or grade retakes to enable students who had failed classes to graduate. Many teachers report that this system is often [manipulated](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/05/the-rise-in-american-high-school-graduation-rates-looks-puffed-up) so that students easily and quickly pass learning only a fraction of the course content.
1.5.4.5.2.1.3. Pro: Many high schools were allegedly [mislabeling](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/06/10/412240568/raising-graduation-rates-with-questionable-quick-fixes) school-leavers as graduated or else discounting them from graduation statistics when many had not graduated, but merely enrolled elsewhere for credit recovery.
1.5.4.5.2.1.4. Con: Providing multiple pathways to graduation is arguably a vital safety net for students of all backgrounds and learning styles, especially those in underprivileged communities.
1.5.4.5.3. Con: Obama pushed for transparency in admission for colleges to ease the process for students, which resulted in the creation of [a college "scorecard"](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/01/13/500421608/obamas-impact-on-americas-schools) which provides data on colleges and costs.
1.5.4.5.4. Pro: The Obama Administration's $4 billion [Race to the Top](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/race-to-the-top-for-education-a-flop-report-finds-096709) \(RTTT\) initiative did not succeed in creating positive educational reform.
1.5.4.5.4.1. Pro: The RTTT paved the way for the [Common Core State Standards](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/01/13/500421608/obamas-impact-on-americas-schools) \(CSSS\), the adoption of which had a detrimental effect on education.
1.5.4.5.4.1.1. Pro: The CSSS led to an [increase](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2015/11/20/common-core-anxiety/76114566/) in test anxiety, which can have serious health implications.
1.5.4.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Text anxiety increases the prevalence of wider mental health issues such as [depression and anxiety](http://neatoday.org/2015/04/23/our-children-are-being-tampered-with-a-teacher-speaks-out-on-emotional-effects-of-high-stakes-testing/) while [decreasing](https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3361&context=dissertations) academic performance.
1.5.4.5.4.1.2. Con: The CSSS were [still](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/01/22/what-the-new-common-core-tests-are-and-arent/) successful in establishing a base, standard criteria on which student achievements from different states across the country could be compared.
1.5.4.5.4.1.3. Pro: The adoption of the CSSS [failed to address](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736) the fundamental [causes](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736) for educational inequality and low achievement, thereby [exacerbating](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736) them.
1.5.4.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: The Common Core's tests [decreased](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736) student's skills in subjects such as reading and math, resulting in worse long-term educational outcomes.
1.5.4.5.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: This lead to a [decline](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736) in the percentage of students being ready for college.
1.5.4.5.4.1.3.2. Pro: The U.S. Secretary of Education conceded that the tests were designed so that 70% of students would fail, with a much [higher percentage](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736) among the most vulnerable students.
1.5.4.5.4.1.3.3. Pro: A Network for Public Education Board member considered that these tests were manifestly unfair to the neediest children, [feeding into racial determinism](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/results-are-in--common-co_b_9819736?guccounter=1) and thus disproportionately harming Black and Latinx children.
1.5.4.5.4.1.4. Con: A study indicates that the CSSS led to larger, more immediate improvements in student performance than the previous curriculum framework did \([p. iv](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/WP%20127_0.pdf)\).
1.5.4.5.4.2. Pro: The rise of standardised testing under RTTT had a negative impact on the quality of US education.
1.5.4.5.4.2.1. Pro: In a study conducted by the Council of the Great City Schools, [40%](https://archive.is/atjqN#selection-2887.78-2887.111) of districts surveyed reported that test results were not available until the following school year. Given this, neither teachers nor students would be able to effectively use updated results to support the latter's academic improvement.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2. Pro: The emphasis on standardized tests may have resulted in a much [narrower](https://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/case-standardized-testing/) learning experience for students.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: The RTTT initiative offered competitive grants to states who enacted favoured policies most successfully, including [evaluating teachers based on student test scores](https://chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2019/10/08/teacher-evaluation-test-scores-nctq-obama-duncan/). This often led to teachers adapting their curricula and teaching strategy for test score success, rather than for wide and effective learning.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: A greater emphasis on funding than learning can promote a culture of cheating, which does not facilitate effective learning.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The DOE found [no evidence](https://standardizedtests.procon.org/history-of-standardized-tests/) of widespread cheating on the tests.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The DOE is likely biased against showing widespread cheating in a policy it implemented.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2.2. Pro: Prominent historian and academic Richard Rothstein wrote in his 2004 book 'Class and Schools' that a focus on standardised testing in limited subject matter leads many schools to [deemphasise or omit](https://www.epi.org/publication/books_class_and_schools/) subjects such as social studies, literature, art, music, physical education, and other important topics where test scores do not result in judgements of school quality.
1.5.4.5.4.2.2.3. Pro: An overemphasis on standardised testing narrows the breadth of knowledge and skills students develop within the subject areas most commonly tested: teachers are more likely to teach so that students pass the test in those subjects, and not so that they have a well-rounded knowledge of them.
1.5.4.5.4.2.3. Pro: The standardised tests used under RTTT tend to strand both [poorer/minority students and high achievers](https://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CC/0242-nov2014/CC0242PolicyStandardized.pdf) in favour of a more 'egalitarian' outcome.
1.5.4.5.4.2.4. Pro: Since the implementation of the [No Child Left Behind Act](http://www.newgeography.com/content/002522-do-standardized-tests-raise-dropout-rates) in 2003, it has been shown that standardized tests, especially the [high stakes](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2005/rpt/2005-R-0172.htm) ones firmly imposed during the Obama administration, may have [increased](http://fairtest.org/dangerous-consequences-highstakes-standardized-tes) high school dropout rates.
1.5.4.5.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.5.2.
1.5.4.5.4.2.4.2. Pro: This appears to be reflected in the US' [relatively low](https://cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/23-advanced-economies-us-adults-rank-21st-math-skills) position in worldwide adult competency rankings for reading and Math skills in 2013.
1.5.4.5.4.2.5. Con: Standardised testing has [been](http://theconversation.com/students-test-scores-tell-us-more-about-the-community-they-live-in-than-what-they-know-77934) used as a barometer to gauge student achievement by other administrations in the past, and hence Obama cannot be singled out as the only one responsible for its shortcomings.
1.5.4.5.4.2.6. Con: In 2015 Obama released a [Testing Action Plan](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/obama-administration-takes-action-ensure-fewer-and-better-tests-students) promoting a reduction in standardized testing and providing guidance for states and school districts to create improved, less burdensome tests.
1.5.4.5.4.2.7. Pro: A range of statistics show the academic performance of US students to have decreased after standardised testing increased, which may suggest a causative link.
1.5.4.5.4.2.7.1. Pro: Use of standardised testing [increased](http://saintpetersblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/standardized-test-data-AP-photo.jpg) from 4th grade to 8th, while student performance decreased. This correlation may suggest that use of these tests actively harmed academic performance over time.
1.5.4.5.4.2.7.2. Pro: Following the introduction of RTTT standardized tests, the US dropped in international education [rankings](https://www.fairtest.org/how-standardized-testing-damages-education-pdf).
1.5.4.5.4.2.7.3. Pro: National and international assessment results show that, in 2015, average math scores for fourth- and eighth-graders [fell](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/) for the first time since 1990, while reading and science proficiency had [stagnated](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/12/how-do-american-students-compare-to-their-international-peers/509834/) compared to 2012.
1.5.4.5.4.3. Con: RTTT redefined the goal of the education system as '[college and career readiness](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/education/k-12/race-to-the-top)'. This was a [much-needed reform](https://www.educationnext.org/results-president-obama-race-to-the-top-reform/) that had stalled in state legislatures, stood no chance of enactment in Congress, and could not be accomplished via unilateral action.
1.5.4.5.4.4. Con: Of the 12 jurisdictions that received grants from the Race to the Top initiative, [9 of them](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/what-is-race-to-the-top-and-how-will-it-benefit-public-schools) have met their benchmarks for the year as of 2019.
1.5.4.5.4.5. Con: There are many complex [barriers](https://www.teachthought.com/the-future-of-learning/12-barriers-innovation-education/) to overcome when implementing the changes required to integrate national educational reforms on a state or local level. It is therefore unlikely that any report released only 2-3 years after the start of the RTTT initiative could infer accurate, final conclusions as to its overall success or failure.
1.5.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.
1.5.5. Con: Obama's failed economic policies did not adequately improve the economy, which was a big factor in the Democrats [losing](https://fpif.org/obamas-legacy-lost-elections-hillary/) to Trump in the 2016 elections.
1.5.5.1. Con: Much of the US economy's current strength is thanks to economic policies [implemented](https://www.ft.com/content/b5b764cc-d657-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e) by Obama; that Americans were unable to acknowledge the efficacy of these long-term policies does not negate their success.
1.5.5.2. Con: American workers lost out economically due to a confluence of factors - [such as](https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/trump-versus-globalization/) globalisation and technological development - that are not directly linked to the Obama administration's actions.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Even as jobs and economic opportunities for workers in the region vanished, Obama [continued](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/disaffected-rust-belt-voters-embraced-donald-trump-midwestern-obama) to ignore the plight of those in the Rust Belt throughout the latter half of his presidency.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Evidence suggests that Trump's economic policies have [helped](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/how-trump-rescued-the-economy-from-obamas-failed-policies) rescue the US economy from the economic harms caused by Obama's failed policies.
1.5.5.5. Pro: Trump's popularity in the [Rust Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt) states stems from the fact that he - unlike his Democrat counterparts - [promised them jobs](https://fpif.org/obamas-legacy-lost-elections-hillary/), which significantly contributed to his win over Hillary Clinton.
1.5.6. Con: Economic inequality stayed constant, and according to some indicators worsened, under the Obama administration.
1.5.6.1. Pro: [Income inequality](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/) reached its highest level since 1928 during Obama's presidency.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Income inequality has been [steadily rising since the 1970s](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/), indicating that the high level of income inequality during Obama's presidency is not solely attributable to him.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Middle-class incomes [fell](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/income-gap-growth-obama-trump-administations-economy-politics/) significantly during the Obama presidency, only to rise again after two years under the Trump administration.
1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: In 2015, [7 in 10](https://www.pewresearch.org/2017/01/10/how-america-changed-during-barack-obamas-presidency/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=17-01-10%20Obama%20Lookback&org=982&lvl=100&ite=679&lea=131846&ctr=0&par=1&trk=) Americans felt that Obama’s economic policies after the recession did little or nothing to help middle-class people.
1.5.6.1.2.2. Pro: Since the start of Trump's administration, middle-class incomes have [risen by $5,003](https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/middle-class-incomes-surging-thanks-trump-policies) and median household income has increased by 8% to $65,976.
1.5.6.1.2.3. Con: A [direct comparison](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/06/01/432923/obamas-legacy-economy-anything-mess/) between Obama's and Trump's economic policies is very difficult because Obama inherited an economy in steep recession, while Trump inherited a strong and improving economy.
1.5.6.1.2.4. Pro: Between 2007 and 2016, the average wealth of the bottom 99% dropped by [$4,500](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality).
1.5.6.1.2.4.1. Con: In 2007, the [global financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) hit; this thus constitutes a considerable confounding variable when analysing the impact of Obama's policies on the middle-class during the 2007-2016 period.
1.5.6.2. Pro: [Gender economic inequality](https://inequality.org/gender-inequality/) persisted throughout Obama's administration.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Racial economic inequality remained constant, and may have even worsened, under the Obama administration.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.5.6.3.2. Pro: The [median wealth](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/) of non-Hispanic black individuals fell by 33.7% from 2010 to 2013, resulting in the largest wealth gap between black and white individuals since 1989.
1.5.6.3.3. Pro: The poverty statistics for African American individuals as compared with other demographic groups did not change during the Obama administration, remaining consistently poor.
1.5.6.3.3.1. Pro: During the Obama administration, [25%](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/11779946/Barack-Obama-has-done-zero-for-black-people.html) of black households lived below the poverty line compared to just 8% of white households.
1.5.6.4. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.
1.5.6.5. Con: The [Council of Economic Advisers \(CEA\)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-income-gap-began-to-narrow-under-obama/) has reported that Obama's policies reduced income inequality.
1.5.6.5.1. Pro: The CEA identifies Obama's [policies mitigating the effects of the recession](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-income-gap-began-to-narrow-under-obama/) as one of the ways in which Obama reduced inequality. These policies extended unemployment benefits and cut payroll taxes, which kept unemployment lower than it would otherwise have been.
1.5.6.5.2. Pro: The CEA estimates that the Obama administration's policies helped the poorest fifth of American households [earn 18% more](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-income-gap-began-to-narrow-under-obama/) in 2017 than they otherwise would have.
1.6. Pro: Obama was a good role model to people.
1.6.1. Con: The actions of Obama and his administration have been hypocritical and inconsistent, thus undermining his position as a good role model.
1.6.1.1. Con: All politicians need to adapt to rapidly changing political climates and situations. This can result in their policies appearing inconsistent, but often they are a consistent reflection of a changing public and political belief.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Though Obama [often criticizes](https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/web-video/former-president-barack-obama-criticizes-president-trump) Trump for what he deems to be unjust and unethical policies and actions, he has committed similarly controversial acts in the past.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Obama and Trump have been deemed "[like-minded](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/20/trump-proving-not-obama-but-likeminded-middle-east-wars-column/2605623002/)" in terms of their policies regarding the Middle East.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Trump and Obama have significantly differing policies [with regards to](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/23/trump-obama-foreign-policy-226708) their approaches to Iran and Israel.
1.6.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Trump [withdrew from the](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-obama-policies-trump-killed-were-some-of-the-44th-presidents-hallmark-achievements-13130973) Iran Nuclear Deal, which was considered to be a hallmark diplomatic decision by the Obama administration.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: Trump and Obama have had extremely differing policies and ideologies in their tenures.

1.6.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.6.1.2.2.3. Pro: Obama and Trump have had different policies and views with regards to [LGBTQ+ individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/trump-attack-lgbt-rights-supreme-court).
1.6.1.2.2.3.1. Con: In 2019, Trump [became](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/trump-pride-month-tweet-anti-lgbt-record) the first Republican president to recognise the LGBTQ+ celebration of Pride Month, signalling a break from his party's tradition and a continuity with the Obama administration.
1.6.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.6.3.1.
1.6.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Whereas Obama sought for more LGBTQ+ representation in the military by repealing the [DADT Act](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/22/obama-repeals-dont-ask-dont-tell), Trump's [ban on trans individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/22/obama-repeals-dont-ask-dont-tell) in the military takes away from that progress.
1.6.1.2.2.3.4. Pro: Trump [withdrew a piece](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama) of federal guidance by the Obama administration which allowed transgender students unrestricted access to bathrooms and locker rooms in-line with their gender identity.
1.6.1.2.2.4. Pro: Trump and Obama have differing policies with [regards to Russia](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/inauguration-2017/analysis-contrast-between-obama-trump-unprecedented-n708456), with the former pushing for a softer foreign policy stance.
1.6.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: At the G-7 summit in 2019, Trump advocated for Putin, to soften [Russia's pariah status](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-advocates-for-putin-at-g-7-summit-in-move-to-soften-russias-pariah-status/2019/08/26/fa28b0f0-c81e-11e9-a1fe-ca46e8d573c0_story.html).
1.6.1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Donald Trump has [eased sanctions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/27/us-lifts-sanctions-oleg-deripaska-russia) that were placed against major Russian companies during the Obama administration.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Obama has often been criticized as the reason for the [degradation of relations](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/13/europe/russia-from-anti-us-to-anti-obama-dougherty/index.html) between the United States and Russia.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Obama's [dismissal](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/03/05/dont-rehabilitate-obama-on-russia/) of Russia as a 'regional power' acting 'out of weakness' in Ukraine sparked outrage from the Russian government.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: There [was](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/03/05/dont-rehabilitate-obama-on-russia/) great personal animosity between President Obama and President Putin.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.3. Con: The Obama Administration [went](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/03/05/dont-rehabilitate-obama-on-russia/) to great lengths to not provoke Russian aggression, only taking a more assertive stance after the Russian annexation of Crimea.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.4. Con: The Obama administration attempted to implement a ["reset" policy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-putin-diplomacy-special-repor/special-report-how-the-u-s-made-its-putin-problem-worse-idUSBREA3H0OQ20140418) in 2009, where Obama led a series of initiatives to improve relations with Russia in the long-term.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.4.2. Pro: Russia agreed to allow for NATO supplies to pass [through it to Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/world/asia/21pstan.html) as a result of Obama's visit to Russia in 2009.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.5. Pro: The Obama administration's expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats on charges of interfering with the US presidential elections created a [strain](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack) on US-Russia relations.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.5.1. Con: Expelling 35 Russian diplomats for interfering with the US presidential elections is not what strained US-Russia relations; the [Russian interference](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/26/us/2016-presidential-campaign-hacking-fast-facts/index.html) strained them. As such, tensions arose due to Russia, not Obama.
1.6.1.2.2.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: Expelling 35 Russian diplomats was a justifiable and proportionate course of action because they were identified as Russian "[intelligence operatives](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack)" who were threatening the legitimacy of American democracy.
1.6.1.2.2.4.4. Con: Some Russian policies demanded or enabled by Trump have nevertheless matched Obama's usual hardline stance, with certain instances showing Trump to have mandated even harsher ones than Obama did in a similar context.
1.6.1.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: Trump granted defensive anti-tank weapons systems on Ukraine's request to use these against Russia, [whereas Obama refused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-has-not-been-soft-on-russia-hes-been-tougher-than-obama/2019/03/28/08e88a04-5194-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html) to do so.
1.6.1.2.2.4.4.2. Pro: For the [European Deterrence Initiative](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/03/21/the-european-deterrence-reassurance-initiative-sends-the-wrong-message/) - a response to Russia's annexation of Crimea - Trump [requested more than](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-has-not-been-soft-on-russia-hes-been-tougher-than-obama/2019/03/28/08e88a04-5194-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html) $17 billion, whereas Obama asked for just $5 billion.
1.6.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.6.1.2.4. Pro: [Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/10/11/trump-may-be-against-forever-wars-hes-no-dove/) and [Obama](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/reality-check-yes-president-obama-is-a-hawk/256674/) are both extremely pro-military action, which have led to similar consequences.
1.6.1.2.5. Con: Obama is considered to be a much more moral president than Donald Trump, [as evidenced](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barack-obama-president-of-character-and-integrity_b_588a4b0ae4b06558f8e94f02) by their respective approval ratings after taking office.
1.6.1.2.5.1. Pro: Presidential approval ratings are a [representation](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barack-obama-president-of-character-and-integrity_b_588a4b0ae4b06558f8e94f02?guccounter=1) of the respect the public gives to a particular president's character.
1.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Many opinion polls provide evidence that people think Obama is a good role model.
1.6.2.1. Pro: According to a recent poll carried out by YouGov, Barack and Michelle Obama are [the most admired](https://www.good.is/obama-most-admired-in-america) man and woman in the US.
1.6.2.2. Pro: According to [YouGov polls](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Barack_Obama), Obama is described by his fans as "intelligent, presidential, a good speaker, a leader and someone who stands up for ordinary people" - all qualities that make a good role model.
1.6.2.3. Con: Opinion polls that conclude that Obama is a good role model may suffer from [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) as people have an incentive to feel that they made the right decision in voting for Obama.
1.6.2.4. Con: Most opinion polls in the US may suffer from [a Democratic bias](https://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/why-did-polls-get-it-wrong-most-suffer-from-democratic-bias/) within elite media corporations, therefore they are not credible.
1.6.2.5. Con: Since opinion polls are usually optional, they should not be considered a credible measure for determining if someone is a good role model or not, as they may only reflect the opinion of the group that decided to take part in the poll.
1.6.3. Con: Being a good role model to people does not necessarily equate to being a good president.
1.6.3.1. Con: No one singular quality is enough to constitute an all-round good leader; however, there are qualities, such as being a good role model, that may be considered significant contributing traits.
1.6.3.2. Con: According to [an online opinion poll](https://thetylt.com/politics/do-presidents-need-to-be-role-models), 66.4% of people feel that a good president needs to be a good role model, whereas only 33.6% feel that results matter more.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: This argument contains the fallacy [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), as this argument proposes that due to the majority of the population believing the president needs to be a good role model, it must therefore be correct.
1.6.4. Con: It is a truism to call Obama a good role model, since any president that gets elected needs to be considered a good role model by the people on some level in order to win.
1.6.4.1. Con: There are a [host](https://www.stritch.edu/Magazine/Summer-2016/What-factors-do-voters-consider-when-they-vote-for) of other factors considered by voters when making their decisions in the US Presidential Elections.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Polls have identified the [top 10 qualities](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-10-qualities-a-presidential-candidate-can-have-according-voters-2019-7?r=US&IR=T) Democratic voters look for in a presidential candidate; being a good role model does not make the list.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Con: Some of the [qualities](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-10-qualities-a-presidential-candidate-can-have-according-voters-2019-7?r=US&IR=T) identified in this list do indirectly amount to being a good role model. For example, "growing up poor" shows that the candidate pushed through the barriers of circumstance and embodies the [American Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream) - qualities of a good role model.
1.6.4.2. Con: Despite being elected as president, Donald Trump is [seen](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/09/what-trump-accomplishes-matters-more-than-being-good-father-figure/) by the majority of Americans as being a poor role model for children.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Former President George W. Bush and Former First Lady Barbara Bush are [seen](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-ahp-column-love-essentially-tl-1213-story.html) as role-models for many married Americans.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Many presidents are considered role models by their voter base.
1.6.4.4.1. Pro: A 2018 survey [found](https://theweek.com/speedreads/750974/72-percent-republicans-think-trump-good-role-model-children) that 72% of Republicans feel that President Trump is a good role model for children.
1.6.5. Pro: Obama has received many prestigious [awards and honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_honors_and_awards_received_by_Barack_Obama) which illustrates that he is a good role model to people.
1.6.5.1. Con: Receiving awards and honours does not necessarily indicate that one is a good role model.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Knut Hamsun was a Nobel Prize winner who was [also a Nazi sympathizer](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/rehabilitated-nobel-prize-winner-who-fell-for-hitler-1768518.html), indicating that awards do not automatically point to an individual being a good role model.
1.6.5.1.2. Pro: Aung Sung Kyi [has](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/aung-san-suu-kyi-wont-be-stripped-of-nobel-peace-prize-despite-rohingya-crisis) won the Nobel Peace Prize and yet is complicit in the Rohingya genocide taking place in Myanmar; receiving an award does not automatically make a leader a good role model.
1.6.5.2. Pro: In 2009, "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples", Obama became [the fourth](https://www.thoughtco.com/which-presidents-won-nobel-peace-prize-3555573) US president to ever be [awarded](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2009/press-release/) the Nobel Peace Prize.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: In 2015, the ex-Nobel Secretary, Geir Lundestad, [expressed regret](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34277960) while admitting that awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama failed to achieve the purpose the committee had hoped for.
1.6.5.3. Pro: In 2017, Obama became among the one of the few individuals to be [awarded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/05/obama-just-got-the-pentagons-medal-for-distinguished-public-service-its-more-common-than-critics-think/) the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.
1.6.5.4. Pro: In 2013, despite repeated criticism over his lack of support for Israel, Obama was [awarded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/18/barack-obama-israel-presidential-medal-distinction) the [President's Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Medal_\(Israel\)), the highest civil medal given by the State of Israel.
1.6.5.5. Pro: Obama has [won](https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barack-obama) two Grammy Awards in the Best Spoken Word Album category for his two memoirs 'Dreams from My Father' in 2005, and 'The Audacity of Hope' in 2007.
1.6.6. Pro: Even most of Obama's political opponents think he was a good role model as a president.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.6.6.2. Con: A poll by [Gallup in 2015](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/06/politics/obama-gallup-approval-rating-polarized/) concluded that Obama was the most polarising US president in history, owing to the stark difference in his approval rating among Republicans and Democrats.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: This is, arguably, more a result of increasing polarization in the US than of Obama's conduct in office.
1.6.6.2.1.1. Pro: Surveys show [that](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/?utm_source=link_newsv9&utm_campaign=item_268982&utm_medium=copy) "the level of division and animosity – including negative sentiments among partisans toward the members of the opposing party – has only deepened", and that political affiliation [colors approval ratings of Presidents](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/268982/impact-increased-political-polarization.aspx) more than ever before.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Obama's election as a president from being a freshman US Senator inspired other US Senators to bid for presidency during their freshman senate terms, including [three Republican senators](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/0428/The-Obama-paradox-Why-he-is-a-role-model-to-three-Republican-senators): Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz.
1.6.6.4. Pro: Republican Senator Tom Cotton has admitted that Obama is [a good role model](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/314979-cotton-obama-a-good-role-model), saying that he is a quality family man and inspires the same behaviour in young American men.
1.6.7. Pro: For many, Obama [inspired](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/deepdive/obama-legacy-promise-hope-44597110) [hope](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/barack-obama-michelle-obama-presidency-2008-progress-black-lives-matter-a7402631.html) and optimism.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Obama's presidential campaign was run on a platform of hope.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Obama's campaign was not unique in this regard. Every presidential campaign is run on a platform of hope for a better future; this message is just not always this explicit.
1.6.7.1.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump ran his campaign on the basis of "[Make America Great Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again)". This implies the hope for a better, greater future for the country.
1.6.7.1.1.2. Pro: One of the slogans of [George W. Bush's campaign in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_2004_presidential_campaign) included a direct reference to hope: "A Safer World and a More Hopeful America".
1.6.7.1.2. Pro: Obama's famous "[Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster)" poster became a [pop culture phenomenon](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-the-obama-hope-poster_b_133874).
1.6.7.1.3. Pro: In Obama's [campaign speech](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/10/barackobama) when he first announced that he would be seeking the Democratic nomination, he made hope a central theme.
1.6.7.1.4. Pro: In Obama's [victory speech](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/obama-s-victory-speech-hope-of-a-better-day-a-588520.html), he credited the American ideal of "unyielding hope" and said, "I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight".
1.6.7.1.5. Con: Since Obama's presidential campaign was run on a platform of hope and he was able to get elected through it, it may be argued that Obama's intentions for inspiring hope and optimism were mostly selfish and self-serving.
1.6.7.2. Con: Hope and optimism are not always inherently good: they may result in [unrealistic expectations](https://www.students4bestevidence.net/blog/2017/07/28/hope-may-lead-to-unrealistic-expectations/) that are ultimately more harmful than beneficial.
1.6.7.3. Pro: Obama's election inspired millions of young people to [dream even bigger](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/07/barack-obama-forever-changed-black-america).
1.6.7.3.1. Pro: Barack Obama is [considered a role-model](https://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-obama-kenya-hope-20081231-story.html) for many young people in Kenya, inspiring them to be optimistic about their futures.
1.6.7.4. Con: Analysis of Obama's use of language during his presidency revealed that he was [less positive than any other president in modern times](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/28/obama.speeches.mood.psychology/index.html).
1.6.7.4.1. Con: As this article also notes, Obama's [sombre overtone](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/28/obama.speeches.mood.psychology/index.html) was nonetheless construed as powerfully hopeful and optimistic by many, suggesting that inspiring hope and optimism does not necessarily require exuberant positivity.
1.6.8. Pro: Obama was a role model for people who are traditionally overlooked in politics and leadership roles.
1.6.8.1. Con: Obama was unrepresentative and unsupportive of American immigrants, who are frequently overlooked in politics.
1.6.8.1.1. Pro: By attempting to [negotiate with](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/latino-activists-obama-completely-failed-us) Republicans on immigration reform instead of pushing it through Congress as he did for healthcare, Obama showed the Latino community in the US that they were not his priority.
1.6.8.1.1.1. Pro: This was done despite a [considerable amount](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/28/republicans-democrats-both-flip-flop-immigration-borders-column/2696286002/) of agreement with regards to immigration reform between Democrats and Republicans, unlike healthcare, where they [differ significantly](https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national/democracy-2018/how-republicans-and-democrats-differ-on-issue-of-health-care).
1.6.8.1.2. Con: Obama can be a good representative for immigrants in America, given that he is the son of a [Kenyan immigrant](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/04/obamas-father-forced-out-at-harvard-053968).
1.6.8.1.2.1. Pro: Obama's father faced significant racially-motivated discrimination when he came to the US, including [being forced out of Harvard](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/04/obamas-father-forced-out-at-harvard-053968). This would suggest Obama is able to personally relate to some of the struggles faced by non-whites and immigrants in the US today.
1.6.8.1.2.2. Con: Various [accounts](https://www.npr.org/2011/07/11/137553552/president-obamas-father-a-bold-and-reckless-life), including that of [Obama](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-opens-up-about-his-father-his-mother-and-his-marriage) himself, suggest that Obama did not spend any significant time with his father before the latter died in 1982, casting doubt over whether he was truly exposed to the US immigrant experience via his father.
1.6.8.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.6.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.6.8.2. Pro: Obama expressly described himself as a [feminist](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/barack-obama/obama-i-am-what-feminist-looks-n592581), which is likely to have inspired and emboldened others to support women's rights.
1.6.8.2.1. Con: Obama has received tweets criticising the 2016 [essay](https://www.glamour.com/story/glamour-exclusive-president-barack-obama-says-this-is-what-a-feminist-looks-like) he wrote for Glamour Magazine on feminism, as well as responses claiming that he is [mansplaining the movement](https://www.newsweek.com/why-it-matters-when-obama-calls-himself-feminist-487380) from a position of privilege.
1.6.8.2.2. Pro: Obama [endorsed Hillary Clinton](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president-barack-obama-formally-backs-hillary-clinton-n589091) for the White House, helping her become the [first woman](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/20/us/hillary-clinton---fast-facts/index.html) in US history to be nominated by a major party. This further indicates his commitment to feminism.
1.6.8.2.2.1. Con: There are other reasons that can explain Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton that are not motivated by a commitment to feminism.
1.6.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Obama may have felt that this progressive endorsement would be politically advantageous to the Democratic Party, and so his endorsement of Hillary Clinton was a means to other ends.
1.6.8.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Obama's endorsement of Clinton came at a time when Bernie Sanders was being [pressured to step down](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/obama-endorses-clinton-his-successor) in order to defeat Donald Trump; hence, one could ascribe a similar intention to the move.
1.6.8.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton came after she had [already won four out of six of the primaries](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-36485012) and been declared the presumptive Democratic nominee. Therefore, Obama's hands were politically tied in endorsing Hillary Clinton.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: Obama may have endorsed Hillary Clinton because she would be the least likely candidate, if elected, to reverse the policies that he passed during his presidency.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.1. Con: This is unlikely to be the case as Clinton had different stances on policy issues from the Obama administration.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Clinton strongly stood [against](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hillary-clinton-trade-deal-229381) the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was one of the landmark economic agreements proposed by the Obama administration, after she began campaigning for the presidency in 2016.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: [According](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-hillary-clinton-would-differ-barack-obama-foreign-policy-n653596) to insider experts, Clinton had fundamental differences with Obama on issues of foreign policy, preferring a much more aggressive approach.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: [In Syria](https://www.ft.com/content/407f62ac-53dc-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef), Clinton supported providing rebels with weapons in 2012, bombing missions, and establishing a "no-fly" zone after Russian airstrikes; Obama either rejected, or was skeptical of, all her suggestions.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Clinton's ideas on social policy [have](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/why-hillary-clinton-s-ideas-are-so-similar-president-obama-n410141) closely mirrored Obama's, including her stance on the minimum wage, immigration and community college.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.1.4. Con: Obama introduced [equal pay rules](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/01/eeoc-pay-discrimination-obama/433926/), requiring large companies to disclose employee pay based on race and gender. In 2016, Clinton was [also pushing for equal pay](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/22/hillary-clintons-top-10-campaign-promises/). As such, it was clear that if Clinton won, she would likely strengthen Obama's equal pay policies.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Given that Hillary Clinton served as [the Secretary of State](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hillary-Clinton/Secretary-of-state-and-2016-presidential-candidate) during Obama's presidency, it is likely that she would not have reversed most of his policies as she was a part of the same administration.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Clinton had [significant](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/23/hillary-clinton-record-secretary-of-state-foreign-policy) differences of opinion with Obama while serving as his Secretary of State.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: According to many reports, Obama felt that Hillary Clinton's presidency would further his own policy agenda, and hence solidify and advance his legacy.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: Joe Biden claims that Obama discouraged him to run for president because he believed Hillary Clinton was [better placed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/14/joe-biden-claims-barack-obama-repeatedly-discouraged-running/) to secure his legacy.
1.6.8.2.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: While speaking to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Obama said that he would “consider it a personal insult" to his ["legacy"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/obama-congressional-black-caucus-speech-clinton) if the African American community failed to vote, and encouraged them to vote for Hillary.
1.6.8.2.2.2. Pro: Obama's pronouncement of the Clinton campaign slogan, 'I'm with her', [combined](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/09/obama-endorses-hillary-clinton-meeting-bernie-sanders) with his remark that 'I don't think there has ever been someone so qualified to hold this office', underscores his support for a female President of the United States.
1.6.8.2.2.2.1. Con: Pronouncing Clinton's campaign slogan, 'I'm with her', would likely have been part and parcel of publicly endorsing her anyway. As such, this pronouncement does not significantly enhance his commitment to feminism per se.
1.6.8.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Political slogans play an important [role in helping win elections](https://www.lpk.com/latest/2015/10/22/active-emotive-presidential-campaign-slogans-meredith-post/), and so endorsing Clinton by pronouncing 'I'm with her' likely served a broader PR strategy to get a Democratic candidate elected, irrespective of who the candidate was.
1.6.8.2.2.3. Con: If Obama was so committed to feminism, he would have pulled out of the [2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries) and let Hillary Clinton run for president, instead of winning over her.
1.6.8.2.2.3.1. Con: Being a feminist does not require you to believe that women should be in positions of power simply because they are women, and should artificially be handed success. Obama cannot be considered anti-feminist simply because he ran against a woman.
1.6.8.2.2.4. Pro: Obama went out of his way to endorse Hillary Clinton's nomination - becoming one of the very few presidents to campaign so [strongly](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/05/484817706/looking-back-at-a-century-of-presidents-not-campaigning-for-their-successor) for their chosen successor.
1.6.8.2.3. Pro: Shortly after Obama publicly identified as a feminist, [Justin Trudeau](https://www.newsweek.com/justin-trudeau-emulates-obama-feminism-essay-his-own-682696) appeared to emulate him when he penned an article on the importance of men describing themselves as feminists. This suggests Obama might have inspired him.
1.6.8.2.4. Pro: Obama has [made](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/barack-obama-feminist-quotes-gender-equality-pay-a9038796.html) many public statements in support of gender equality and the feminist movement.
1.6.8.3. Pro: As the first black President of the United States, Obama is an esteemed role model for [black Americans](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/07/barack-obama-forever-changed-black-america).
1.6.8.3.1. Con: Obama's election was ultimately detrimental to the cause of racial justice in the USA; on these grounds, he cannot be considered a fit role model for African Americans.
1.6.8.3.1.1. Pro: Obama has been reluctant to do [anything significantly positive](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/08/is-barack-obama-a-fit-role-model-for-black-youth/) on behalf of African Americans and specifically racial justice.
1.6.8.3.1.1.1. Con: Obama's reluctance may be [due](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/08/is-barack-obama-a-fit-role-model-for-black-youth/) to his race, or his advisors fearing that if he does make any changes, he may end up pushing some ethnically Caucasian voters over the edge by alienating them. This would arguably make things even worse for the cause of racial justice.
1.6.8.3.1.2. Pro: [Studies show](http://english.khamenei.ir/news/3628/Racism-grew-bolder-in-US-under-Obama-presidency-study-reveals) that racism worsened throughout Obama's presidency.
1.6.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: The percentage of individuals that explicitly expressed anti-black attitudes [increased](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/27/racial-prejudice-worsened-obama) over the first term of Obama's presidency, rather than decreasing.
1.6.8.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.6.8.3.1.4. Pro: Obama's election created the inaccurate idea among Americans that racial inequality had been overcome.
1.6.8.3.1.4.1. Pro: Obama’s election may have led many Americans to [incorrectly assume](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/08/is-barack-obama-a-fit-role-model-for-black-youth/) that racism no longer poses relevant barriers to black advancement and racial equality in the US.
1.6.8.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Obama's election [was cited as](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kadiagoba/mitch-mcconnell-reparations-slavery-obama) the USA's "atonement for slavery" by Mitch McConnell.
1.6.8.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: A study found that [many Americans believed](http://english.khamenei.ir/news/3628/Racism-grew-bolder-in-US-under-Obama-presidency-study-reveals) that Obama's election showed that there was no longer a need for policies that aimed to reduce racial discrimination, such as affirmative action.
1.6.8.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: After Obama's election victory, participants of a [study on racial justice](https://depts.washington.edu/sibl/Publications/Kaiser,%20Drury,%20Spalding,%20Cheryan,%20&%20O'Brien%20\(2009\).pdf) concluded that racism was less of a problem in the US, despite the continued prevalence of racial disparities in American society. \(p. 558\)
1.6.8.3.1.4.2. Pro: Obama's election as the first black president may have given his presidency [fake-progressive clothing](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/08/is-barack-obama-a-fit-role-model-for-black-youth/) by making it appear that the problem of racial inequality had been solved.
1.6.8.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Obama's election may have allowed liberals to feel that they were [doing something](https://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/08/is-barack-obama-a-fit-role-model-for-black-youth/) progressive just by supporting him, instead of pushing his administration into making actual strides towards racial equality.
1.6.8.3.1.4.3. Con: Obama used his platform as president to [speak out](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/barack-obama-2008-race-speech-in-full-rev-jeremiah-wright-us-president-orator-philadelphia-a7520331.html) about racial inequality. It is unlikely that US citizens would have begun believing that racial inequality had ceased to exist when their president was frequently discussing it.
1.6.8.3.1.4.4. Con: To the contrary, a national survey conducted at the end of Obama's presidency showed that opinions on racial equality [were](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/) highly polarised between white and black Americans.
1.6.8.3.2. Con: According to [polls](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2008-clinton-obama-epic-duel-n1029626) running up to Obama's election in 2008, more black voters were set to vote for Hillary Clinton compared to Obama. This tempers the view that black Americans were struck by Obama as a role model.
1.6.8.3.3. Pro: Obama's presence in the White House proved to black Americans and the world that they are [capable of genius](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/07/barack-obama-forever-changed-black-america), career excellence, and humanity.
1.6.8.3.3.1. Pro: The Obama family has helped [humanise](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/07/barack-obama-forever-changed-black-america) the black experience through, among other things, normalising black excellence and codifying graceful resistance to white supremacy.
1.6.8.3.3.2. Con: There are many other role models in the lives of black Americans who could provide this.
1.6.8.3.3.2.1. Pro: There are [numerous](https://newsone.com/2064927/black-geniuses/) prominent African American figures who are renowned for their [intellectual brilliance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/30/black-genius-macarthur-ta-nehisi-coates).
1.6.8.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: A diverse group of African American artists, advocates and scientists were among the 2015 recipients of the [MacArthur fellowship “genius” grants](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/29/ta-nehisi-coates-macarthur-fellow-genius-grants).
1.6.8.3.3.2.2. Con: While there are undoubtedly countless other black American figures who have achieved excellence, becoming President of the United States is arguably regarded by many as the ultimate and most obvious pinnacle of success. As the first and only black US president to date, it is thus Obama alone who has proven that reaching such extreme heights of success is possible for black Americans.
1.6.8.3.3.3. Pro: Given the historical lack of success African Americans have had in the political sphere, Obama's election as the president makes him a [counter-stereotypical role model](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/vpvaughns/assets/pdfs/Sasha%20and%20Malia%20\(2011\).pdf) for African Americans \(p. 2\).
1.6.8.3.4. Pro: Obama's election as the president is said to have created [the Obama Effect](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199390618.001.0001/acprof-9780199390618-chapter-6), which refers to positive changes in racial attitudes as a result of offsetting negative stereotypes about African Americans. This makes him an esteemed role model for African Americans.
1.6.8.3.4.1. Pro: Studies show a [positive influence](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46e8/3e6db832bf8c8be6ce73e25f07155c6f5a66.pdf) on the academic performance of African Americans as a result of the Obama Effect \(p. 2\).
1.6.8.3.4.1.1. Pro: A quantitative [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109000742) showed [a reduction](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/education/23gap.html) in the performance gap between African American and white students, on a 20-question test administered before Obama's nomination and after he became president.
1.6.8.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Participants in [Friedman's study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109000742) were [not randomly assigned to the test conditions](https://www.newsweek.com/lab-notes-obama-effect-real-79639), instead volunteering to be in the Obama test condition. This is a confounding variable because those selecting the Obama condition may have been more likely to show the Obama effect from the outset. The reliability of this study is therefore compromised.
1.6.8.3.4.1.2. Pro: A qualitative study investigating the effect of Obama's election on recent male African American high school graduates in southeast Georgia revealed that his election had a [positive influence](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2279&context=etd) on their perceptions about the world and their future \(p. 99\).
1.6.8.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: The study found Obama’s election [changed](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2279&context=etd) the way participants "perceived themselves, as well as how they perceived the way the world sees African American males" \(p. 99\).
1.6.8.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: The study found that Obama’s election made most participants feel [positive](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2279&context=etd) about their futures, believing that his election had "increased their likelihood of success" \(p. 99\).
1.6.8.3.4.1.2.3. Con: The qualitative study is not representative enough given that it only had [8 participants](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2279&context=etd) and only focused on southeast Georgia \(p. 33\).
1.6.8.3.4.1.3. Con: A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109001206?via%3Dihub) investigating whether the Obama Effect had a positive influence on academic performance of African Americans relative to white students disconfirmed the findings of other studies, finding that test performance and positive thoughts about Obama had no relationship.
1.6.8.3.4.1.4. Con: A study of actual test takers and their performance on the GRE revealed that the level of performance of African Americans before and after Obama's election [remained unchanged.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15534510.2013.878665)
1.6.8.3.4.2. Pro: A [study](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/index.php/2012-10-11/research/media-obama-effect-and-racial-prejudice) shows that the Obama Effect, through continuous media coverage of Obama and his family, may have helped challenge the negative stereotypes many white Americans associated with African Americans.
1.6.8.3.4.2.1. Con: According to the study, the positive change in racial attitudes had little to do with Obama's election and more to do with the [prolonged television exposure](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/index.php/2012-10-11/research/media-obama-effect-and-racial-prejudice) that he received.
1.6.8.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Prolonged television exposure of Obama would likely have been directly or indirectly connected with his election campaign and subsequent election. As such, the two cannot be easily separated.
1.6.8.3.4.3. Con: [Critics](https://www.thenation.com/article/obama-effect-quick-fix-black-achievement/) argue that the Obama Effect is incorrectly identified as a quick fix for black achievement through magic role models and mis-prioritises the need for long term investment and reforms.
1.6.8.3.4.4. Pro: A [study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46e8/3e6db832bf8c8be6ce73e25f07155c6f5a66.pdf) suggests that African Americans exposed to Obama showed more inclusive social perceptions of self and others, with African Americans high in cultural socialization additionally reporting greater self-other overlap with people of other races \(p.1\).
1.6.8.3.5. Con: Some African Americans feel that Obama's life was so [far-removed from their own struggles](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-rolemodel/obama-as-role-model-for-black-youth-not-so-fast-idUSTRE4AF00320081116) that his election as president did little to practically motivate them towards success.
1.6.8.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.8.1.2.1.
1.6.8.3.5.2. Pro: Obama's [stepfather](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chapter-i-a-childhood-of-privilege-not-hardship), whom his mother married while Obama was still young, was wealthy and influential in the Indonesian government.
1.6.8.3.5.2.1. Con: For the first six years of Obama's life, he was raised by his [single mother](https://www.npr.org/2011/05/03/135840068/the-singular-woman-who-raised-barack-obama) who was on food stamps. As such, he has experienced real hardship that others may identify with.
1.6.8.3.5.3. Pro: In his own words, Obama attended a "[prestigious prep school](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chapter-i-a-childhood-of-privilege-not-hardship)", which was an "incubator for \[Hawaii's\] elites", noting that his grandfather pulled strings to get him admitted.
1.6.8.3.5.4. Pro: Obama has never lived in a [black neighbourhood](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/chapter-i-a-childhood-of-privilege-not-hardship), instead opting to commute up to 90 minutes when working on projects in these communities.
1.6.8.3.5.4.1. Con: Obama [began](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/at-a-chicago-housing-project-pride-in-obama-but-a-hope-for-more-change/2017/01/08/b6ebba6e-d378-11e6-a783-cd3fa950f2fd_story.html) his career working for the [Altgeld Gardens housing project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altgeld_Gardens_Homes) in a severely impoverished, almost entirely African American part of Chicago. As a result, and even though he did not live there, he would have acquired an understanding of the challenges faced by African American communities.
1.6.8.3.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.6.8.3.5.6. Con: Despite his different class background, Obama has been able to [normalize](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/07/barack-obama-forever-changed-black-america) the presence of African Americans in the highest echelons of American society.
1.6.8.3.5.7. Pro: [Joshua Aronson](https://www.newsweek.com/lab-notes-obama-effect-real-79639), a social psychologist, states that the best role models are those seen as having worked hard to achieve success. Contrary to this, Aronson reasons, Obama is "too innately talented" for typical black Americans to identify with him.
1.6.8.3.5.8. Pro: Both Obama and Obama's father studied at [Harvard Law School](https://millercenter.org/president/obama/life-before-the-presidency).
