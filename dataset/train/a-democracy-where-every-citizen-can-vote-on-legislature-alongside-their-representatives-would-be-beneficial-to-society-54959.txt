1.1.4.1. Con: Citizens may also be susceptible to bribery and corruption.
1.1.4.2. Con: Empowering citizens over representatives may lead to a surge in power from extremist groups.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Many representatives allow [bribes and political favours](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group) to influence how they vote on policy.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Political corruption leads to [mistrust of government](https://www.ibac.vic.gov.au/preventing-corruption/corruption-hurts-everyone), and a disruption of social order.
1.1.5. Con: There is no guarantee citizens will use their opportunity to vote.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Voter [turnout](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/03/in-past-elections-u-s-trailed-most-developed-countries-in-voter-turnout/) is consistently low in many democracies.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Referendums see [mixed turnout](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/history-of-referendums-shows-turnout-will-be-crucial-1.3507532) depending on individual attachment to the issue at hand, suggesting that people may not always utilize their vote on legislation.
1.1.6. Pro: Democracy is [currently underperforming](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190318-can-we-reinvent-democracy-for-the-long-term) in serving society's aims.
1.1.6.1. Pro: In order for democracy to be effective, it needs an overhaul.
1.1.6.2. Con: Giving every citizen the chance to vote on legislation would worsen existing issues within democratic voting processes.
1.2. Con: Implementing a system where every citizen can vote on every topic would be impractical.
1.2.1. Pro: Voting on legislature [is time consuming at present](https://norton.house.gov/how-a-bill-becomes-a-law). Adding more voices into the conversation would likely complicate matters further.
1.2.2. Con: Impracticality is warranted if the result is a more fair system.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Many of the obstacles to such a system will be in it's introduction.

1.2.5.1. Con: People would not have to vote on every matter.
1.2.5.2. Con: People are more likely to [make time to vote](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/16/947182471/why-people-dont-vote)(In particular, Latino groups say that Latinos have a lower participation rate because of a historical lack of thoughtful and sustained engagement from campaigns and lawmakers alike.) if it is on issues of importance to them.
1.2.5.3. Con: Convenience is not a factor in [individual voting habits.](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/16/947182471/why-people-dont-vote)(They don't generally, however, believe it is difficult to vote in the United States: Three-quarters say it is at least somewhat easy to cast a ballot. Instead, non-voters feel a sense of alienation and apathy; they are generally detached from the news and pessimistic about politics.)
1.2.5.4. Pro: Voting involves [becoming familiar with the issues](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/06/vote) and understanding the best way to approach them. This is very time consuming.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Those most available to vote on legislation would likely be non-working people, meaning such a system would disadvantage the working class.
1.3. Pro: This would encourage more people to be active participants in politics.
1.3.1. Con: With the rise of anti-establishment politics, [empowering more people](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/10/19/6-things-to-know-about-rising-anti-establishment-politics-in-the-us-and-europe/) in politics could be dangerous.
1.3.2. Pro: Citizens should be engaged in shaping the policies and laws that directly affect their lives.
1.3.3. Con: Legislation requires [specialized skills and comprehension](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23030406?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)(Using the law effectively requires expertise that goes far beyond understanding the meaning of the words used to communicate it: certain complex aspects of the law cannot be eliminated by mere simplification of language and this article demonstrates that other specialized skills are required over and above the ability to penetrate technical language.) that may alienate laypeople and discourage engagement with politics further.
1.3.3.1. Con: Legislation can easily be made accessible to others, which may benefit government transparency overall.
1.3.3.2. Con: Many non-government workers work in fields adjacent to policy and law making that would enable them to understand and engage with policy.
1.3.4. Pro: Many people do not vote [as they feel disengaged](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/16/947182471/why-people-dont-vote). Involving citizens in legislative decisions could combat this by ensuring they can be involved in the policies that matter to them.
1.3.4.1. Con: Referendums are often highly divisive. Greater engagement as a result of legislation votes may lead to a more polarized society.
1.3.5. Con: A self-selection bias could lead to a lack of proportional representation in decision making settings.
1.4. Con: Many citizens may not have sufficient knowledge to vote on some topics, while representatives may be more informed.
1.4.1. Con: Citizens are commonly more connected with the impact of social legislation than representatives, who are somewhat [isolated from its consequences](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/democrats-republicans-political-beliefs-national-survey-poll)(Bubble-ism, the report suggests. Even more than their Republican counterparts, highly educated Democrats tend to live in exclusively Democratic enclaves. The more they report “almost all my friends hold the same political views”, the worse their guesses on what Republicans think.).
1.4.1.1. Pro: Allowing citizens to vote on legislation would ensure that policy is more connected to the needs of society.
1.4.1.2. Con: Those with extreme prejudiced views may negatively influence the development of social policies.
1.4.2. Pro: Representatives often have backgrounds in political education or have years of experience.
1.4.2.1. Con: Career politicians can pose a threat to [modern democracy](https://ngu-vision.squarespace.com/newsfeed/2018/10/30/opinion-the-problem-with-career-politicians)(Career politicians often run into the risk of not keeping the peoples’ best interest in mind. At any job, it is best for an employee to keep their boss happy with them. It makes sense for an employee to cater to the demands of their employer. This remains the same with politicians. \n\nMost do not like to acknowledge the fact that the President of the United States is an employee to their respective political party. This does not only apply to the president, but to the other members of Congress as well. From the Senators to the Congressman, everyone has a boss \(their party\) that they must answer to. \n\nUnfortunately, this means that most politicians forget that their bosses should ultimately be the American people. However, we cannot fault these politicians for listening to their bosses; every hard-working person does. What we can fault however is our system.), suggesting experience is not always an advantage.
1.4.2.2. Con: More experience may mean that representatives are deeply entrenched in the current system, and are less likely to pursue progressive changes.
1.4.3. Pro: Many citizens are disengaged from political discourse, and therefore would be unfamiliar with the topic.
1.4.4. Con: Everyone has blind spots, including representatives. Citizens participating in these decisions may help to correct these biases.
1.4.5. Pro: Many voters are [biased and uninformed](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/voters-knowledge-political-news-varies-widely-study-shows) about policy and political processes.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Minorities are [significantly uninformed](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/voters-knowledge-political-news-varies-widely-study-shows)(The study found the most conversant voters tend to fall into the 50-70 age group, with wealthy, educated white men over the age of 47 being the best informed. The least-informed voters were young, low-income minority women.\n\nThe average minority female voter age 47 or less with a below-median income had a 30% probability of knowing a typical news story. By contrast, the average white male voter age 48 or older with an above-median income had a 44% probability of knowing the same story.), and may be less engaged as a result.
1.4.5.2. Con: The current voting system reinforces the epidemic of uninformed voters. Implementing a new system could act as an impetus for voters to become more active and engaged.
