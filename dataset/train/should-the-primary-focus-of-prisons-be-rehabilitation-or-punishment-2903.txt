Discussion Name: Should the Primary Focus of Prisons be Rehabilitation, or Punishment?

1. The primary focus of prisons should be rehabilitation and reintegration, not punishment.
1.1. Pro: Rehabilitation [reduces the likelihood of a criminal reoffending](https://law.jrank.org/pages/1936/Rehabilitation-Does-correctional-rehabilitation-work.html)(In contrast, it is now apparent that rehabilitation programs generally reduce recidivism and, when conducted according to the "principles of effective treatment" \(Gendreau\), cut reoffending substantially \(Andrews and Bonta; Cullen and Gendreau; Lipsey and Wilson; Lurigio\). Evidence favorable to rehabilitation has been generated by a statistical technique called meta-analysis. Traditionally, criminologists such as Martinson would read over a group of studies evaluating treatment programs. They would then either describe what the studies found—a narrative review—or try to count how many studies showed that offender treatment worked or did not work—the "ballot box" method. A meta-analysis, however, essentially computes a batting average across all studies, calculating the average impact of treatment on recidivism. Using this method, the existing research, which now involves hundreds of evaluation studies, shows that rehabilitation programs reduce recidivism about 10 percentage points.), providing the greatest benefit to the community.
1.1.1. Pro: Many countries seem to have reduced recidivism rates by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons.
1.1.1.1. Pro: In the Netherlands, where the prison system [focuses heavily on rehabilitation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/12/why-are-there-so-few-prisoners-in-the-netherlands)(Why are there so few prisoners in the Netherlands?\n\nThe Dutch justice system is cutting jail populations by offering specialist rehabilitation to people with mental illnesses\n\n\[...\]\n\nToday plummeting prison sentences have left the Netherlands with an unusual problem: it doesn’t have enough inmates to fill its prisons, even after renting out places to Norway and Belgium.\n\nSince 2014, 23 prisons have been shut, turning into temporary asylum centres, housing and hotels. The country has Europe’s third-lowest incarceration rate, at 54.4 per 100,000 inhabitants.), there has been such a large decline in prison population that they have started accepting prisoners from [other countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/norwegian-inmates-sent-to-dutch-prison-cells-too-full)(Norway has sent a group of inmates to a jail in the Netherlands because its own prisons are too full.\n\n“The first prisoners have arrived,” Karl Hillesland, the Norwegian head of Norgerhaven prison in the Netherlands said on Tuesday.\n\nDue to lack of space, more than 1,000 inmates in Norway are waiting to be placed in prisons, where they are often assigned to individual cells. To solve the problem, Norway has leased Norgerhaven prison from the Netherlands.).
1.1.1.2. Con: Some countries with rehabilitative prison systems still incarcerate dangerous prisoners for extended periods.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The mass murderer responsible for the 2011 terrorist attack in Oslo was sentenced to [21 years for his crimes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/norwegian-mass-killer-anders-breivik-begins-parole-hearing)(Far-right Norwegian terrorist, who murdered 77 people, trying for parole after 10 years in jail\n\nThe mass killer, who has served less than half of his 21-year sentence, has shown no remorse over the massacre and could use the hearing as an opportunity to voice his extreme views, experts say.) and [may never be released](https://www.thejournal.ie/21-years-breivik-trial-sentence-norway-570722-Aug2012/)(A sentence of permanent detention can be imposed if there is considerable danger of repetition. Permanent detention is not subject to any timeframe. However, the court always fixes a timeframe that may not exceed 21 years. When the timeframe expires the offender may be re-assessed. If the court concludes that there is still a danger of repetition the timeframe may be extended by up to five years at a time. There is no upper limit to the number of times that the court may extend the timeframe.).
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The [worst individual mass murderer](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-deadliest-mass-shootings-in-history.html)(1 Garissa University College Attack Garissa, Kenya 2015 148\n2 Peshawar School Massacre Peshawar, Pakistan 2014 149\n3 November 2015 Paris Attacks Paris, France 2015 130\n4 2011 Norway Attacks Oslo, Norway 2011 77) in history is not a reasonable example of a common exception to the rule.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Sweden expanded the ability for courts to [hand down life sentences](https://www.thelocal.se/20190605/swedish-laws-are-about-to-get-tougher-on-murder/)(The law change will mean that more external factors can be considered for a life sentence.\n\n“It could be that the perpetrator caused the victim severe suffering, that the method was particularly reckless, that a person close to the perpetrator was the target, that it happened in the victim's home or in front of other people close to them, for example children,” explained Sweden's Justice Minister Morgan Johansson, adding that two thirds of female murder victims are killed by someone close to them.\n\nA majority of convicted murderers will be sentenced to life in jail after the new law comes into effect, according to the minister, with the percentage of life sentences then set to increase from 30 to over 50.) to murderers in 2020.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: Alternatively, there are some prisons in punishment-oriented countries that [focus on rehabilitation](https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/alabama-paroles-bureau-buys-private-prison-in-perry-county-to-use-for-rehabilitation.html)(The Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles has purchased a vacant, private prison in Perry County to use as a rehabilitation facility for parole violators.\n\nBureau Director Cam Ward said the bureau will pay $15 million for the Perry County Correctional Center, a 700-bed prison on U.S. 80 in Uniontown. The prison was owned by GEO Group, a private prison company. It will be called the Paroles Reentry Center. The contract was signed Tuesday.).
1.1.1.3. Con: Statistics on recidivism are hard to compare, as many countries use different criteria to measure the rates at which criminals reoffend \([p. 2](http://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf)(It should be noted that comparing international recidivism rates can be tricky. Countries track them differently, often using different terms \(reconviction, re-arrest, relapse, re-imprisonment\) and varied lengths of time for studies \(1 yr, 3 yrs, 10 yrs\).)\).
1.1.1.4. Pro: Nordic prisons, many of which primarily focus on rehabilitation, have low recidivism rates \([p. 1](https://encompass.eku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1680&context=honors_theses)(While countries in Scandinavia have an incarceration rate averaging only 75/100,000 people, the rate in the U.S. is more than 700/100,000. Scandinavian countries have the lowest recidivism rate in the world: less than 20%, and the United States has a recidivism rate of 70% \(Deady, 2014\).)\).
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Sweden’s focus on rehabilitation resulted in such a low recidivism rate \([40%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/26/prison-sweden-not-punishment-nils-oberg)(With reoffending rates at about 40% – less than half of those in the UK and most other European countries – does he attribute this success to the country’s effective policies on prisoner rehabilitation? “We obviously believe that it is part of the explanation; we hope we are doing something right. But it’s going to be very difficult to prove that scientifically. We are increasing our efforts all the time,” he says.)\) that it had to [close four prisons](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/01/why-sweden-closing-prisons)(Why is Sweden closing its prisons?\nSweden's prison population has dropped so dramatically that the country plans to close four of its prisons. What lessons can the UK learn?) in 2013.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Nearly all prison terms in Sweden are less than ten years. Even life sentences effectively mean that felons will only be in prison until a judge decides that [they have been rehabilitated](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/01/why-sweden-closing-prisons)(jail terms rarely exceed 10 years; those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term, usually in the region of 18 to 25 years. Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimise short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures – proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending.).
1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Sweden's recidivism rate of 40% is still [double](https://theworld.org/stories/2015-04-15/finlands-open-prisons-inmates-have-keys)(“The lesson from Finland was that it was perfectly possible to drop the use of imprisonment \[by two-thirds,\]” he says, “and that did not disturb the crime trend development in Finland.”\n\nWhat did work was a gradual reintroduction into normal life, the kind that the open prisons offer. About a third of Finnish inmates are housed in open prison, and Finland’s Criminal Sanctions Agency says inmates who go through open prisons are less likely to be arrested again. The reoffending rate drops almost 20 percent.) that of neighboring Finland, where one-third of the inmates cohabitate with the guards in open prisons.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: Nordic countries have [smaller populations](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.SRF.TOTL.K2)(Rank Country 2022 Population 2021 Population Growth Rate Area Density \(km²\) \n\n\[...\]\n\n92 Sweden 10,218,971 10,160,169 0.58% 450,295 23/km²\n\n\[...\]\n\n116 Denmark 5,834,950 5,813,298 0.37% 43,094 135/km²\n\n\[...\]\n\n118 Finland 5,554,960 5,548,360 0.12% 338,424 16/km²\n\n119 Norway 5,511,370 5,465,630 0.84% 323,802 17/km²) and are [wealthier](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/the-nordic-exceptionalism-what-explains-why-the-nordic-countries-are-constantly-among-the-happiest-in-the-world/)(To examine this issue, we take a look at the Gallup World Poll data as regards these factors. Given that the Nordic countries are all relatively rich \(Nordic countries occupy a range from 6 \(Norway\) to 21 \(Finland\) in the 149-country ranking of GDP per capita\), we are especially interested what factors beyond GDP per capita make the Nordic countries stand out.) than most other countries. These inherent advantages make comparisons with other countries unproductive.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Most Nordic countries are [welfare states](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/08/will-everyone-shut-up-already-about-how-the-nordic-countries-top-every-global-ranking.html)(They exist within a broader societal context. The small gender gap, the chance for all students to succeed in school, the respect for the dignity of the homeless, paid leave—all of this exists because the Nordic countries are, proudly, welfare states.\n\nEvery one of the aforementioned policies exists because it is part of a welfare state, and because, in the Nordic countries unlike in America, there is no shame \(and, in fact, quite a lot of pride\) in being a welfare state. There are many who think that we, too, should move to a welfare model. However, in a country wherein healthcare is deemed “a part of a socialist vision for America” \(and wherein that is necessarily understood to be a bad thing\), the establishment of this kind of political system does not seem very likely.). Therefore, their low recidivism rates are not a result of specific penal policies but a consequence of the broader political system which enables them.
1.1.1.4.4. Pro: Norway’s [low crime rate](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/)(Personal security is a core element for the well-being of individuals. Do you feel safe out walking, alone at night, for example? In Norway, about 93% of people say that they feel safe walking alone at night, much more than the OECD average of 74%, and the highest in the OECD.\n\nThe homicide rate \(the number of murders per 100 000 inhabitants\) is a more reliable measure of a country's safety level because, unlike other crimes, murders are usually always reported to the police. According to the latest OECD data, Norway's homicide rate is 0.6, less than the OECD average of 2.6.) shows that the concept of [restorative justice](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12?r=US&IR=T)(Norway also has a relatively low level of crime compared to the US, according to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. The majority of crimes reported to police there are theft-related incidents, and violent crime is mostly confined to areas with drug trafficking and gang problems. \n\nBased on that information, it's safe to assume Norway's criminal justice system is doing something right. Few citizens there go to prison, and those who do usually go only once. So how does Norway accomplish this feat? The country relies on a concept called "restorative justice," which aims to repair the harm caused by crime rather than punish people. This system focuses on rehabilitating prisoners.), which focuses on rehabilitating prisoners, is an effective means of reducing criminality.
1.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: [Recidivism](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism)(Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime.) in American prisons, which focus on punishment, is nearly twice as high as recidivism in Norwegian prisons, which focus on rehabilitation \([p. 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472929/pdf/pone.0130390.pdf)(Reconviction rates\n\n\[...\]\n\nNorway 2005 Prisoners 2 years 20%\n\n\[...\]\n\nUS 2005–2010 Prisoners 2 years \n36%)\).
1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: Norway is a [fairly homogeneous society](https://www.wallstwatchdog.com/money-career/3-reasons-why-norways-prison-system-should-not-be-replicated-in-america/)(Norway is a fairly homogeneous society with a shared history and culture. In contrast, the United States is a cacophony of cultures and immigrants. There is constant friction between established groups and society’s reinvention by new batches of immigrants.) compared to the US, making comparisons between the two less valuable.
1.1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Norway is predominantly [white European](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/norway-population)(The ethnicities in Norway are recorded as Norwegian 83.2% \(includes about 60,000 Sami\), other European 8.3%, other 8.5% by the Factbook as well.), while the US has a [large African American population](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/)(There were 46.8 million people in the U.S. who identified as Black in 2019. The Black population has grown by more than 10 million since 2000, when 36.2 million of the U.S. population identified as Black, marking a 29% increase over almost two decades.\n\nMore than 4.6 million Black people in the U.S. were born outside the country as of 2019, meaning that 10% of the Black population was foreign born. This is an increase from 2000, when 2.4 million people, or roughly 7%, among the Black population were foreign born.) due to its historical legacy of slavery \([p. 12](https://extranet.sioe.org/uploads/sioe2016/gouda_rigterink.pdf)(Estimates suggest that an increase in the slave population from 0% to 15.6% \(the mean level in the sample\) is associated with an additional 0.12 instances of violent crime per 100,000 population, or an increase in violent crime of between 1.5% and 2.2%, depending on the base line level of crime in the state at hand. Increasing the slave population by two standard deviations from its mean level results in an estimated increase in violent crime of 0.32 instances per 100,000 population, representing an increase in the range of 4.2% to 6%. This is in line with our overall hypothesis regarding the relation between slavery and violent crime. Note that while we find that this relation persists across the decades, we cannot really strictly compare the estimated coefficients due to the differences in the numbers of observations between the years.)\).
1.1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: The population of Norway is more diverse than at any point in history, with immigration accounting for [72% of population growth](https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/large-diversity-in-little-norway)(The ethnic and cultural diversity in Norway is greater now than ever before. The population grew 1.3 per cent last year, with immigration accounting for 72 per cent of this growth. This means that the country’s population, which has passed the 5 million mark, is now much more diverse. Equally diverse are the reasons for persons born in other countries embarking on the long or short journey to Norway with hopes of living and working here. Their children, with their multi-cultural backgrounds, will also gradually make their mark on the country.).
1.1.1.4.4.1.1.3. Con: Immigrants make up about [19%](https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/innvandrere/statistikk/innvandrere-og-norskfodte-med-innvandrerforeldre)(Immigrants and Norwegian-born to immigrant parents in per cent of total population\n18.9) of the population of Norway. In the US, the rate stands at about [14%](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states)(More than 44.9 million immigrants lived in the United States in 2019, the historical numeric high since census records have been kept. In 2019, immigrants comprised 13.7 percent of the total U.S. population, a figure that remains short of the record high of 14.8 percent in 1890.), making the two countries relatively comparable.
1.1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1. Con: The proportion of immigrants in the Norwegian prison system is [much higher](https://www.wallstwatchdog.com/money-career/3-reasons-why-norways-prison-system-should-not-be-replicated-in-america/)(The Times story observes that a large number of current inmates in Norway’s prison system are immigrants. In fact, the share of foreign prisoners in Norway’s prison system has been steadily increasing over the years. That increase has also coincided with an increase in the number of immigrants to Norway.\n\nCompare that to the United States, where only 6% of the prison population is from abroad. Extrapolating past data, it may be reasonable to conclude that as the number of immigrants seeking asylum in Norway increases due to its welfare model, the number of foreign prisoners may also increase.) than in the US because undocumented immigrants in the US are [far less likely](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014704117)(Contrary to public perception, we observe considerably lower felony arrest rates among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants and native-born US citizens and find no evidence that undocumented criminality has increased in recent years. Our findings help us understand why the most aggressive immigrant removal programs have not delivered on their crime reduction promises and are unlikely to do so in the future.) to commit crimes.
1.1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Economic models between the US and Norway are [vastly different](https://www.wallstwatchdog.com/money-career/3-reasons-why-norways-prison-system-should-not-be-replicated-in-america/)(First, the two countries work on different economic paradigms. Much like other Scandinavian countries, Norway subscribes to the social welfare state model. In this model, the state levies high taxes from a mostly rich population and, in return, provides a number of social services, ranging from day care to paternity leave.\n\nAs a result of the broad public agreement between the country’s citizens about social welfare, the government has considerable leeway and freedom to pursue radical experimentation in providing social services.\n\nIn contrast, the American economic system is a melange of capitalism, libertarianism, and restricted social welfare. This system is best reflected in the constant tension between pure libertarianism and government intervention in America.), which renders the two incomparable.
1.1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Pro: As a result of their economic models, inequality in the US is [much higher](https://borgenproject.org/norway-quality-of-life-far-exceeds-america/)(The United States has a lower per capita GDP than Norway with a GDP of 51,749 compared to 99,558, respectively, and is also home to one of the most pressing income distribution gaps in any industrialized nation, surpassed in income inequality by only Russia and Mexico.\n\nDue to America’s cavernous income inequality, the poorest 38% of Norwegians are better off than the poorest 38% of Americans despite an overall lower average per capita GDP. According to Syracuse University professor Timothy Smeeding, the United States relies heavily on the markets to an extent that social safety nets are neglected, unlike Norway, which focuses more resources on providing aid to the poor.) than in Norway, which causes a [higher crime rate](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/does-inequality-cause-crime/381748/)(Strain theory suggests that when poorer people perceive inequality, they feel less of a commitment to social norms and in turn come to view crime as more acceptable. The key insight the Hicks’s study provides is that when potential criminals are giving up on social expectations, they’re doing so based on information that’s visible, not information that’s password-protected.).
1.1.1.4.4.1.2.2. Con: Pointing out all the differences between the two countries is not conducive to adapting some of the potential teachings from Norway for application in the US prison system.
1.1.1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Several US states are [implementing Norwegian-style prison reforms](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/special-reports/2019/10/11/states-put-norway-style-prison-reforms-to-work/1682876001/)(U.S. prison officials and academics are increasingly looking to Norway's approach to incarceration for ideas to reduce recidivism rates that are higher in the United States than anywhere else in the world. \n\nNorth Dakota and Oregon have been front-runners in implementing Norwegian-style reforms, said Brie Williams, director of Amend: Changing Correctional Culture, a nonprofit based at the University of California San Francisco.) in hopes of reducing recidivism.
1.1.1.4.4.1.4. Pro: Louisiana, the state with the highest incarceration rate in the US, implemented a reentry court to provide prisoners with the highest certifications available in their chosen vocation. These simple steps have reduced recidivism to [a fraction of the state's overall 50% recidivism rate](https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/379814-the-criminal-justice-systems-top-job-breaking-the-cycle-of-crime/)(Louisiana, the state with the highest incarceration rate in the country, implemented a program known as “reentry court” in 2010. This innovative approach combines mentoring, substance abuse treatment, and intensive vocational training. Those participating in this program are permitted to obtain the highest level of certifications in their chosen vocation while serving their sentences. With this qualification in hand, participants then must obtain a job offer before they can be released to an intensive reentry program. Early outcomes have shown recidivism rates at a fraction of the almost 50 percent failure rate among others who exit prison in Louisiana.) for the unrehabilitated prisoners.
1.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: The [incarceration rate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-norways-prison-system-is-so-successful-2014-12?r=UK&IR=T)(That makes Norway's incarceration rate just 75 per 100,000 people, compared to 707 people for every 100,000 people in the US.) in Norway is just 75 per 100,000 people compared to 707 per 100,000 people in the US.
1.1.1.4.4.3. Con: The low crime rate in Norway may be due to other factors such as a [comprehensive welfare system](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/norway-best-country-to-live_n_5a6059c7e4b046f0811d0235)(Norway’s strong social security net, which includes generous parental leave policies, is a key reason the country of just over 5 million people is consistently rated one of the best places in the world to live.), [high average household income](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich)(Best known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer.\n\nPeople in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner \(around $56,200\).\n\nYoung Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X \(those born between 1966 and 1980\) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank The Resolution Foundation.), or even the [weather](https://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/countries-with-the-lowest-crime-rate-in-the-world/)(Norway is an extremely cold country that has long winters, so this is one of the reasons for this country’s lower crime rate. Statistics reveal that Norway typically has fewer than 30 murders per year. This country also has strict gun laws, including the types of weapons that are used for hunting and sports. Law officials also make sure that anyone who has a weapon keeps it in a secure area.).
1.1.1.4.4.4. Con: Norway has a reputation as a safe country, which has paradoxically resulted in [increased human trafficking](https://ocindex.net/country/norway)(Norway is primarily a destination country in the human trafficking trade, with victims arriving mainly via Denmark and Sweden. The number of human trafficking victims in Norway has been steadily increasing since 2007. Reports suggest that perpetrators are usually either Norwegian or share the nationality of the victims. \n\n\[...\]\n\nNorway is a destination and transit country within the human smuggling trade. It is primarily a destination for human smuggling due to its image and reputation internationally as a place of safety and public goods.).
1.1.1.5. Con: Rehabilitation is not consistently effective in [many jurisdictions](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2020/jan/7/california-prison-rehabilitation-programs-costly-and-ineffective/)(A report by the California State Auditor, released on January 31, 2019, found that rehabilitative programs currently offered by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \(CDCR\) did not assist in reducing the state’s 50 percent recidivism rate.\n\nThe report, requested by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, evaluated the cost effectiveness of the CDCR’s budget increase of hundreds of millions of dollars since 2011, when criminal justice reforms were enacted to reduce the state’s prison population. The report highlighted problems in enrollment, staffing, curriculum and oversight, and recommended certain corrective actions.) within the US.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Efficiency improves with time and practice. Future generations will benefit from implementing rehabilitation strategies now.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Many prison officials believe that rehabilitation is not effective because prisoners are [largely unresponsive](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/29/prisoner-rehabilitation-does-not-work-says-former-prisons-boss)(Sir Martin Narey will say in a speech on Tuesday that research to establish a causal link between rehabilitation and reduced reoffending is lacking and short courses cannot fix problems caused by difficult childhoods.\n\n“The things we did to prisoners, the courses we put them on, the involvement of charities, made little or no difference,” he will tell the International Corrections and Prisons Association conference in Buenos Aires.\n\n\[...\]\n\nHe will add: “Stop fretting about rehabilitation. Politely discourage those who will urge you to believe that they have a six-week to six-month course which can undo the damage of a lifetime. The next time someone tells you they have a quick scheme which can transform lives – transform is the word of which you should be particularly suspicious – politely explain that life isn’t that simple.”) to attempted rehabilitation programs.
1.1.1.5.3. Con: Rehabilitation is most effective when planned and coordinated over time, before, during, and after release, instead of a one-off program \([p. 113](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1748895818800743)(In turn, rehabilitative interventions implemented in prison are more likely to be effective if they are followed up after release, and if transition from custody to community is planned and coordinated from an early stage in the sentence. Albeit differently named, designed and delivered by different organizations, and with a focus on achieving different aims, there has been a long history of working with prisoners to address the practical problems they face upon leaving custody. While promoted by British probation services since the 1960s, the delivery of practical assistance for adult prisoners \(except lifers\) on release has been sporadic, not compulsory, generally offered by charitable and voluntary agencies \(latterly by the Probation Service\) and of variable quality.)\).
1.1.2. Pro: Society is at less risk from incarcerated prisoners being rehabilitated than inmates being punished.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Prisons that focus on rehabilitation seem to have fewer escape attempts.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Iwahig Prison in the Phillippines emphasizes keeping a connection between the inmates and their local community; prisoners rarely try to escape and even [pay for some of their upkeep](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/10/7/life-inside-the-philippines-prison-without-walls)(Aside from the maximum-security inmates, who are kept isolated, all convicts learn a trade, including farming, fishing, forestry and carpentry. \n\nThese income-generating activities allow the authorities to partially recoup the money spent on the prisoners’ upkeep.\n\n\[...\]\n\nAlthough penal farms see fewer escape attempts than other Philippine jails – only 20 have occurred at Iwahig in the past decade – a successful June 2014 jailbreak of seven prisoners led authorities to forbid convicts from sleeping outside the barracks.).
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The majority of prison escapees are inmates who walk away from [community correction facilities](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2001/02/how-often-do-prisoners-escape.html)(True, there are still thousands of escapees a year. Why aren’t you hearing about them? The vast majority of escapees are “walk-aways” from community corrections facilities that have minimal supervision. Dramatic, Hollywood-style escapes from maximum security prisons are the ones that draw media attention. \n\nLike their maximum security counterparts, the minimum security walk-aways are usually recovered. State prisons reported that more escapees and AWOL prisoners were returned than escaped every year from 1995 to 1998. The last year with more escapees than recaptured prisoners was 1994, when 14,307 prisoners escaped and 13,346 were returned.\n\nFederal prison breakouts are rarer than state prison escapes. One federal prisoner escaped and was recaptured in 1999, out of a prison population of more than 115,000. He was the only one to escape in the past four years.) with minimal supervision. There are far fewer escapes from maximum security prisons.
1.1.2.2. Con: A violent criminal, while in prison, is a far lesser threat than a poorly-rehabilitated one wandering freely in society.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Rehabilitation programs usually result in criminals being released early \([p. 97](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40865-020-00139-3.pdf)(If need-specific treatment programs are, however, not indicated by risk assessment scores, prisoners can still enter the Prevention of Recidivism Program and are eligible for phased re-entry and early release without having to complete specific treatment modules \(i.e., a standard program\).)\). This reduces the amount of time that society is protected from the criminal.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: A poorly-rehabilitated violent criminal would not be released from prison as they would not have been rehabilitated yet.
1.1.2.3. Pro: If criminals were required to provide a predetermined number of hours of [community service](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-kind-community-service-can-judge-order.html)(In general, judges have broad discretion to decide whether and what kind of community service to order for an offender. As long as the sentence reasonably protects the public's interests and isn't unduly harsh, all different kinds of community service options are available. However, there are a few guidelines that judges must follow when crafting community service sentences.) instead of prison time, they would actually benefit society.
1.1.3. Con: Rehabilitation might not help those convicted of very violent crimes, who may be incapable of reform.
1.1.3.1. Pro: [Supermax prisons in the US](https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/08/the-problem-with-supermax-prisons/)(Super-maximum-security prisons are well-known for being the toughest prisons in America. Intended to be reserved for “the worst of the worst” offenders, they are supposed to be the last stop for prisoners beyond rehabilitation. They occupy something of a presence in our modern society; Arnold Schwarzenegger teamed up with Sylvester Stallone in a movie about two hardened criminals escaping from a supermax cell. Unfortunately, this romanticized version of grizzled criminals going away for life in a supermax prison is inaccurate and contributes to an unhealthy prison culture.), designed to house the most dangerous criminals, [do not offer rehabilitation programs](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2011/8/5/supermax-prisons-21st-century-asylums)(There is no pretence of rehabilitation in supermax prisons; the purpose is harsh punishment. Prisoners endure supersized portions of psychological punishment as a result of strict and prolonged solitary confinement. Inmates are confined for 23 to 24 hours a day, every day, in cells that measure 7-by-12 square feet. It is psychological torture.), suggesting that these prisoners cannot be rehabilitated.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Though supermax prison administrators do not attempt to rehabilitate prisoners, that does not mean that they cannot be rehabilitated.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Supermax prisons have been criticized as [inhumane](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/usa-federal-supermax-prison-colorado-inhuman-and-breach-international-law)(The US government’s callous and dehumanising practice of holding prisoners in prolonged solitary confinement in the country’s only federal super-maximum security prison amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is in violation of international law, Amnesty International said in a new report today \(16 July\).\n \nThe 50-page report - Entombed: Isolation in the US Federal Prison - reveals the severity of conditions faced by prisoners at the United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum facility near the city of Florence in the state of Colorado \(known as ADX Florence\).). Their practices should not be used as a yardstick for effective prison policy.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Many prisoners in supermax prisons are convicted terrorists or career criminals whose release would be a [public security risk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17663629)(The facility, 108 miles \(173km\) from Denver, holds convicted terrorists, militant anti-government extremists, gangsters, and other criminals considered so violent and dangerous mere maximum-security prison is not safe enough.\n\n"We have only the most violent, disruptive and escape-prone inmates in the federal system," says Mark Collins, a spokesman for the prison.); their indefinite detainment is appropriate.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Attempts to rehabilitate or reintegrate prisoners convicted of violent crimes could be traumatizing for the victims and their families.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Some rehabilitation programs, such as restorative justice, can help combat post-traumatic stress disorder in crime victims \([p. 77](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12207-019-09363-9.pdf)(Crime victimisation is a significant life event that can lead to the development of post-traumatic symptomology. Compared with the general population, victims of crime are significantly more likely to present with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\).\n\n\[...\]\n\nThis interpersonal transgression creates an obligation for the offender to repair the damage done by such an act and restore the stakeholders to their prior status \(Zehr 1990\). During the process of repairing the harm, victims are invited to meet with the perpetrator where they are able to discuss the incident. Due to the processes unique to RJ, research has suggested that the intervention has beneficial properties that are absent in other forms of justice, including positive psychological outcomes for victims. As such, RJ has been promoted as an evidence-based intervention that has additional benefits for victims compared with customary adversarial justice.)\).
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Violent, brutal murderers have been granted early release from prison, [causing anguish](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/13/killer-colin-pitchfork-to-be-released-from-prison-after-challenge-fails)(In early June the Parole Board ruled that Pitchfork could be released on licence, saying his behaviour in custody had been “positive and had included extensive efforts to help others”.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe families of the victims have criticised the board’s decision. “There are some crimes so horrendous that a reprieve is not appropriate. It is an affront to natural justice,” Dawn’s uncle, Philip Musson, previously said. “He took their lives in a way which is an absolute torment to those who cared and loved these girls.”\n\n\[...\]\n\nHe pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, two of rape, two of indecent assault and one of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The lord chief justice at the time, Lord Lane, said: “From the point of view of the safety of the public, I doubt if he should ever be released.”) to the surviving family of their victims.
1.1.3.3. Con: Some experts believe [all people are capable of change](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/30/484053435/personality-can-change-over-a-lifetime-and-usually-for-the-better?t=1650016054068)(And while personality traits are relatively stable over time, they can and often do gradually change across the life span. What's more, those changes are usually for the better. Many studies, including some of my own, show that most adults become more agreeable, conscientious and emotionally resilient as they age. But these changes tend to unfold across years or decades, rather than days or weeks. Sudden, dramatic changes in personality are rare.). Regardless of whether they will ever be released, efforts should be made to reform even the most serious criminals.
1.1.3.4. Con: Basing prison systems on the impact they will have on high-risk prisoners, given that [most inmates are low-risk](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2022.html#lowlevel)(Most justice-involved people in the U.S. are not accused of serious crimes; more often, they are charged with misdemeanors or non-criminal violations. Yet even low-level offenses, like technical violations of probation and parole, can lead to incarceration and other serious consequences. Rather than investing in community-driven safety initiatives, cities and counties are still pouring vast amounts of public resources into the processing and punishment of these minor offenses.), is not reasonable.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Some experts consider psychopathy to be [uncurable](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201408/psychopathic-criminals-cannot-be-cured)(According to mental health experts, the short answer to this question is no. Dr. Nigel Blackwood, a leading Forensic Psychiatrist at King’s College London, has stated that adult psychopaths can be treated or managed but not cured.\n\nBlackwood explains that psychopaths do not fear the pain of punishment and they are not bothered by social stigmatization. Psychopaths are indifferent to the expectations of society and reject its condemnation of their criminal behavior. According to Blackwood and others, callous and unemotional psychopaths simply do not respond to punishment the way that normal people do. Consequently, adult psychopaths in prison are much harder to reform or rehabilitate than other criminals with milder or no antisocial personality disorders.).
1.1.3.5.1. Con: Evidence exists that appropriate treatment programs may have some effectiveness in treating psychopathy \([pp. 16-17](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony-Beech/publication/6999230_Psychopathy_Theory_Measurement_and_Treatment/links/0f317536182f364564000000/Psychopathy-Theory-Measurement-and-Treatment.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(It would seem that the pessimistic view of treatment effectiveness on psychopaths has been fuelled by the unsuccessful outcomes of treatment programs inappropriately used. It appears that when an appropriately designed treatment program is implemented, effectiveness of treatment can be demonstrated.)\).
1.1.3.5.2. Con: Psychopathy [may not exist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/wiring-the-mind/201408/psychopaths-the-worst-people-who-don-t-exist)(Despite being in common usage for years, the psychiatrist’s bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual does not include psychopathy as a diagnosis. The World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association and countless other professional bodies have also chosen to avoid the term. Instead of the very real risk of branding people suffering from an often tormenting mental health condition with an emotionally loaded stigmata, they tend to use diagnoses like ‘antisocial personality disorder’. Far from being a useful description, ‘psychopath’ conjures up the perfect image of someone you wouldn’t be desperate to help, someone as inhuman as those previously branded evil.) as a condition. If that is the case, whether it can be treated or not is irrelevant to discussions about rehabilitating criminals.
1.1.3.5.3. Pro: Psychopathy is a [personality disorder](https://www.businessinsider.com/psychopaths-cannot-be-cured-heres-why-2018-2?r=US&IR=T)(Like many personality traits, psychopathy is a spectrum. About 1-2% of men and 0.3-0.7% of women in the general population are estimated to be true psychopaths, but for the rest of us, we fall on the scale somewhere lower down.\n\nPeople who experience psychopathic traits, such as ruthlessness, charisma, impulsivity, and persuasiveness, tend to get through life just fine. Even full-blown psychopaths can be very successful — they just won't ever be the same as everyone else.\n\n\[...\]\n\nIt also means a true psychopath can never be "cured."\n\n"From what I've read, what I've heard, what I've seen and experienced so far, people with dark triad personality disorders cannot and will not change," said Perpetua Neo, a doctor of psychology and therapist, in an earlier article for Business Insider.), not a mental illness. This makes it uncurable.
1.1.4. Con: If society feels that justice is not being done, it could result in vigilantism \([p. 224](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan-De-Keijser/publication/263492175_Public_support_for_vigilantism_confidence_in_police_and_police_responsiveness/links/56a9fc5208aef6e05df426a7/Public-support-for-vigilantism-confidence-in-police-and-police-responsiveness.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(This article provides an empirical test of the common assumption that public support for vigilantism is affected by confidence in police. Aside from assessing the role of diffuse \(general\) confidence in police, we also tested whether police response on a situational level affects how the public views an act of vigilantism. Respondents \(N=385\) were presented with a vignette about vigilantism. Using an experimental between-subjects design, we varied police responsiveness \(high/low\) to precipitating crime as well as vigilante violence \(high/low\). Diffused confidence in police was a significant predictor of support for vigilantism. Additionally, both experimental factors played an important role: low police responsiveness and low vigilante violence led to more support for vigilantism. Citizens are thus sensitive to situational variation when judging a crime. Our findings also emphasise the importance of police action on a local level for the formation of public opinion)\).
1.1.4.1. Con: Even though there are [many cases](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/finance/309544-why-have-no-ceos-been-punished-for-the-financial-crisis)(Nearly a decade after the fraud and irresponsible actions at Wall Street banks, Countrywide Financial, and other companies brought the nation to the brink of total economic collapse, there have been no prosecutions against their key executives.\n\nIs our justice system incapable of pressing these cases to their rightful conclusion? Or just unwilling? None of the chief executives at the companies that caused the 2008 global financial crisis has been held fully accountable. Nobody from Lehman Brothers or Citigroup has been criminally charged. No top executives at Bear Stearns have been indicted.) where high-profile criminal actions result in no prosecutions, people rarely resort to vigilantism.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Members of the public taking justice into their own hands could seriously erode the [state's monopoly on violence](https://www.britannica.com/topic/state-monopoly-on-violence)(state monopoly on violence, in political science and sociology, the concept that the state alone has the right to use or authorize the use of physical force. It is widely regarded as a defining characteristic of the modern state.\n\nIn his lecture “Politics as a Vocation” \(1918\), the German sociologist Max Weber defines the state as a “human community that \(successfully\) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.” Under feudalism, no lords, including the king, could claim a monopoly over the use of violence, since their vassals promised to serve them but remained free to exercise power in their fiefdoms. Moreover, the king and the landed nobility had to share power or compete with the Roman Catholic Church. The modern state, according to Weber, emerged by expropriating the means of political organization and domination, including violence, and by establishing the legitimacy of its rule.).
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The state's monopoly on violence is dependent on the state's continued public support. Therefore, true authority over violence lies with the public \([pp. 1-2](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/cid/files/publications/faculty-working-papers/071.pdf)(Order, we argue, is problematic. Citizens can and do revolt, employing their control over private means of violence to overturn the state. We also note that states that have been founded consensually may, ex post, become predatory; and that a predatory band may form a state that, ex post, enhances the collective welfare. The existence and properties of a state thus can not be assumed. In search of an approach that treats both as endogenous, we instead turn to rational choice analysis.)\).
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: If emotionally distressed victims were allowed to take revenge on the offender, they might overcompensate for their perceived injustice \([p. 482](https://wordpress.nmsu.edu/ketelaar/files/2020/06/Van-den-Bos-2003-On-the-Subjective-Quality-of-Social-Justice.pdf)(This article argues that it is not uncommon for people forming justice judgments to lack information that is most relevant in the particular situation. In information-uncertain conditions, people may therefore construct justice judgments by relying on how they feel about the events they have encountered, and justice judgments may hence be strongly influenced by affect information. Findings show that in information-uncertain conditions, the affective states that people had been in prior and unrelated to the justice event indeed strongly influenced their justice judgments. These findings thus reveal that in situations of information uncertainty, people’s judgments of justice can be very subjective, susceptible to affective states that have no logical relationship with the justice judgments they are constructing. Implications for the social psychology of justice and the literature on social cognition and affect are discussed.)\). Vigilantism must therefore be avoided by ensuring that the offender is punished sufficiently by the state.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Hobbes argued that the state’s monopoly on violence is the most important factor in preventing chaos in society \([p. 2](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/12036.pdf)(In Leviathan \(1651\), Thomas Hobbes argued for a strong state to overcome a »state of nature« in which life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. A strong state was necessary to impose order, he reasoned, because human beings left to their own devices would engage in constant conflict in their search for security. So for Hobbes, any state able to monopolize the use of force was better than none.)\). Any erosion of this monopoly could have disastrous consequences.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: The state's monopoly on violence should be maintained as vigilantes often take revenge upon [innocent people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-54157912)(A man suffered face and head injuries in what police have called a case of mistaken identity by vigilantes.\n\nThe 38-year-old man was assaulted on Woodhorn Lane, Ashington, at about 18:30 BST on Saturday.\n\nNorthumbria Police said it is believed he was attacked after being mistaken for a man accused of sharing indecent posts on social media.).
1.1.4.2.4. Con: If society feels that prisons do more harm than good and that would-be prisoners deserve protection and rehabilitation, it could result in obstruction of justice and fighting police. This could also erode the state's monopoly on violence.
1.1.5. Con: Rehabilitation is arbitrary, difficult to control, and challenging to measure.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Focusing solely on rehabilitation could lead to excessive and arbitrarily long treatments.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The notion of proportionality ensures that prisoners in a retributive system are not held for an inappropriate amount of time \([p. 704](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1440&context=faculty_scholarship)(These two aspects of retributivism, permissive and mandatory, have traditionally come to represent two different types of retributivism. The former has been known in the literature as “strong” or “positive” retributivism, and the latter known as “weak,” “negative,” or “limiting” retributivism. The type that is appropriate as the basis for the Eighth Amendment prohibition on excessive punishment is the “weak,” “negative,” and “limiting” kind. Retributivism under the Eighth Amendment is negative not only because it serves as a statement of what not to do, but also because it serves as a side constraint on the socially desirable practice of punishment.)\). Prisoners being forced to undergo rehabilitation may be held for much longer.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Many countries with rehabilitative prison systems still have [caps on the length](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/12/18184070/maximum-prison-sentence-cap-mass-incarceration)(Other countries show this can work. European nations tend to have shorter prison sentences than the US, and certainly fewer people in prison, along with roughly equal or lower violent crime rates. Norway in particular caps the great majority of prison sentences at 21 years — and its violent crime and reoffending rates are lower than the US’s. \(The cap does have some exceptions, as I’ll explain later.\)) of prison sentences.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Many states which focus on punishment allow their judges to hand out [life sentences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22912075)(Life sentences that truly mean a lifetime in prison are rare in the UK but common in the US. Why is this punishment so prevalent in the US?\n\nLast week, an English court handed a whole-life sentence to Dale Cregan for murdering four people, including two policewomen.\n\nThat penalty means he will never be eligible for release, and it puts him in rare company, making him one of about 50 people in the UK serving such a sentence.\n\nHad he been in the US, he would have been less of an anomaly.\n\nIn the US, at least 40,000 people are imprisoned without hope for parole, including 2,500 under the age of 18.). Punishment-based systems, therefore, can lead to excessive and arbitrarily prolonged penalties.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Some methods of imprisonment can result in inappropriately long sentences. For example, [debtors' prisons still exist](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/02/24/debtors-prisons-then-and-now-faq)(In the United States, debtors’ prisons were banned under federal law in 1833. A century and a half later, in 1983, the Supreme Court affirmed that incarcerating indigent debtors was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection clause. Yet, citizens like Sanders and Ford are, to this day, routinely jailed after failing to repay debt. Though de jure debtors’ prisons are a thing of the past, de facto debtors’ imprisonment is not. So what do we really know about modern-day debtors’ imprisonment – how it returned, when, and where?) despite being outlawed by governments around the world.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: Timed prison terms wouldn't need to exist in a system that focuses on rehabilitation, where rehabilitation staff could determine a prisoner's fitness to leave the care facility and return to society.
1.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: A portion of the prisoner's sentence could include mandatory [educational or skill targets](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/education-opportunities-prison-key-reducing-crime/)(There is a logical argument for prison education: It is a cost-effective way to reduce crime and leads to long-term benefits across the entire U.S. population. In 2016, the RAND Corporation produced a report that showed that individuals who participate in any type of educational program while in prison are 43 percent less likely to return to prison. In addition to reducing recidivism, education can improve outcomes from one generation to the next. Research shows that children with parents with college degrees are more likely to complete college, which can create social mobility for families.); accomplishing the minimum requirements would reduce their sentence.
1.1.5.2. Con: Many countries have [focused on helping rehabilitate prisoners](https://www.kriminalvarden.se/swedish-prison-and-probation-service/rehabilitation/)(All occupational activities in prison aim to improve inmates' chances of leading a drug free and law abiding life after having served their sentence. \n\nIn prison it is compulsory to partake in occupational activites for six hours daily, Monday through Friday. Activites can be working with assembling subcontracted products, indoor maintenance or laundry, for example.\n\nPrisoners can also study part-time or full-time. The Prison and Probation Service has our own school system with over a 120 accredited high school professors. This enables prisoners to continue their education even if they are translocated to another prison facility.\n\nActivities also include attending rehabilitation programs that target drug- and alcohol abuse, violent behaviour, aggression and criminal behaviour. There are group sessions as well as indivual sessions. Usually programs are combined with work or study.) by creating strict guidelines, best practices, and optimal observational and therapeutic analysis strategies.
1.1.5.3. Con: Rehabilitation programs such as the [principles of effective intervention](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1936/Rehabilitation-Does-correctional-rehabilitation-work.html)(Based on meta-analyses of treatment studies, they found that in rehabilitation programs that conformed to the principles of effective intervention, recidivism was about 25 percentage points lower in the treatment as opposed to the control group \(Andrews and Bonta; Cullen and Gendreau\). These principles include: \(1\) target the known predictors of recidivism for change; \(2\) use cognitive-behavioral treatments that reinforce prosocial attitudes and behavior, seek to challenge and extinguish criminal thinking patterns, and provide alternative, prosocial ways of acting; \(3\) focus treatment interventions on high-risk offenders; \(4\) try to take into account characteristics of offenders \(e.g., I.Q.\) that might affect their responsivity to treatment; \(5\) employ staff that are well trained and interpersonally sensitive; and \(6\) provide offenders with aftercare once they leave the program \(Gendreau\).) have provided concrete statistical evidence of their efficacy.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Rehabilitation is harder to measure objectively than the length of a prison term.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Rehabilitation can be faked.
1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Some people have been told to initially [fake their rehabilitation](https://www.uk-rehab.com/treatment-rehab/addiction-recovery/why-are-people-told-to-fake-it-to-make-it-in-recovery/)(This is better understood by thinking about the universal law that states that if you do good things, good things are likely to happen to you. Hopefully, your experiences with addiction have shown you what happens when you do the wrong things, so faking it to make it could be seen as a way of creating good karma for yourself.\n\nFaking it to make it is something all humans do to at least some extent. It is unlikely that you would survive very long in the modern world if you acted on every thought in your head. Sometimes you just need to act like the person you want to be rather than the person you really feel like at that moment. So the advice to ‘fake it to make it’ is not telling you to do anything new – it is really about doing something you already do but more effectively.) in order to help manifest it into a reality.
1.1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Faking rehabilitation is an [unreliable short-term strategy](https://www.uk-rehab.com/treatment-rehab/addiction-recovery/why-are-people-told-to-fake-it-to-make-it-in-recovery/)(Faking it to make it is only a short-term strategy. By initially acting as if you are going to succeed, you start to experience some success in life. As your confidence grows in your ability to shape the future, there is no longer any need for you to fake it – it is just something you do in order to get the ball rolling.) for some and is not a long-term solution for anyone.
1.1.5.4.1.2. Con: [Faking an addiction](https://www.clearviewtreatment.com/resources/blog/factitious-disorder/)(You may have heard of Munchausen syndrome, a disorder in which a person will lie about having a disease or medical condition in order to get treatment. This is also known as Factitious Disorder.\n\nAccording to a researcher at the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Central Connecticut State University, it has been documented that patients have checked themselves in for drug and alcohol rehab when in fact they do not really have a drug or alcohol problem.) is easier than faking rehabilitation.
1.1.5.4.1.3. Con: Someone who is able to convincingly fake something about themselves likely has an [unresolved mental issue](https://www.clearviewtreatment.com/resources/blog/factitious-disorder/)(What the patient does need is treatment for the deep need for attention and perhaps for pseudologia fantastica, or compulsive lying. A study conducted at the University of California demonstrated that habitual liars have more white matter than gray matter in their brain, making a case for a biological reason for faking a long-term, serious illness. But otherwise, another condition, such as a personality disorder, may be serious enough to propel one into pretending to be an addict) that needs treatment; they are unlikely to be provided with such treatment in a prison.
1.1.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: Psychopathic criminals have been known to [manipulate prison staff](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7899143.stm)("The majority of serial sexual homicide offenders will be diagnosed as having psychopathic personality disorder, which the vast majority of clinicians would view as being problematic in terms of treatment," he says.\n\n"Such psychopaths are extremely good at manipulating prison staff, as well as mental health professionals, and over time they can eventually be perceived as being 'cured' and ready for reintroduction into society.) into believing they are rehabilitated.
1.1.5.4.2. Con: Recidivism rates can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation \([p. 8](https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/18-02303_ebook.pdf)(Facilitating offender reintegration is a complex task, and the impact of specific interventions is often difficult to measure. Reduced criminal recidivism remains the ultimate indicator of successful social reintegration programmes. “Recidivism” \(“reoffending”\) refers to whether a person who is the object of a criminal justice intervention reoffends later on.)\).
1.1.5.4.2.1. Con: An offender could take months or years to reoffend; this puts society at risk while the effectiveness of rehabilitation is being evaluated.
1.1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: Every moment the rehabilitated criminal refrains from committing the same crime is a measurable success.
1.1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Reoffending rates are hard to measure, but that applies equally to both punishment-based systems as well as rehabilitation-based systems \([p. 4](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/564634/proven-reoffending-definitions-measurement-Oct16.pdf)(Measuring true reoffending is difficult. Official records are taken from either the police or courts, but they will underestimate the true level of reoffending because only a proportion of crime is detected and sanctioned and not all crimes and sanctions are recorded on one central system. Other methods of measuring reoffending, such as self report studies, are likely to also underestimate the rate.)\).
1.1.5.4.3. Con: Quantifiable rehabilitation goals could include the number of community service hours completed, the number of visits with a life coach or job counselor, or the number of times the inmate exhibited good behavior.
1.1.5.4.4. Pro: The ambiguity of rehabilitation makes it more difficult to measure; some people might be able to rehabilitate faster than others.
1.1.5.4.5. Pro: Prioritizing punishment ensures that everyone is treated [equally under the law](https://studentsforliberty.org/north-america/blog/dont-tread-on-anyone/equal-treatment-under-the-law/)(Equal treatment under the law is an ancient principle which is still of vital importance in the modern world. Almost every constitution worldwide recognizes this fundamental concept, in some form at least. Also known as equality before the law, or isonomy, the basic principle recognizes that all individuals should be treated in exactly the same manner by the law, while all persons should be subject to the same laws.\n\nArticle 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights formalizes this basic right as: \n\nAll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.), a key aspect of deterrence. In punishment-based systems, criminals will be sentenced according to concrete [precedents](https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/map/TheImportanceofPrecedent.html)(In a common law system, judges are obliged to make their rulings as consistent as reasonably possible with previous judicial decisions on the same subject. The Constitution accepted most of the English common law as the starting point for American law. Situations still arise that involve rules laid down in cases decided more than 200 years ago. Each case decided by a common law court becomes a precedent, or guideline, for subsequent decisions involving similar disputes. These decisions are not binding on the legislature, which can pass laws to overrule unpopular court decisions. Unless these laws are determined to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, they preempt the common law precedent cases. Judges deciding cases are bound by the new law, rather than the precedent cases.) rather than abstract rehabilitation concepts.
1.1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Prison as a punishment lasts a predetermined amount of time, as established by a judge. In contrast, uncertainty over whether a criminal is genuinely rehabilitated may result in significant variations in sentence length due to the effort invested by each prisoner.
1.1.5.4.5.1.1. Con: Prisoners in punishment-based systems can still be given inconsistent or [unlimited sentences](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/dec/03/indefinite-sentences-the-greatest-single-stain-on-justice-system)(A former supreme court justice has called for urgent action in dealing with prisoners languishing under indefinite sentences, branding the now defunct scheme “the greatest single stain on our criminal justice system”.\n\nLord Brown, a justice of the supreme court between 2009 and 2012, said the imprisonment for public protection \(IPP\) regime, under which offenders were handed a minimum term but no maximum term, required “long overdue” reform.\n\nDespite the use of the sentencing power being scrapped in 2012, more than 3,200 prisoners remain locked up under the regime, including those who have been recalled to prison, prompting critics to brand it the “never-ending sentence”.).
1.1.5.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The [general public was outraged](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/06/481010919/california-rape-case-sentence-sparks-outrage)(But others, including the Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen, say Turner, who was a top swimmer at Stanford, got off easy when he was sentenced to six months in county jail and three years' probation. Turner was convicted in March on three felony counts. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of six years in prison.\n\nThe case has sparked a campaign for the recall of Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky.\n\nAt the sentencing, Persky said he considered Turner's lack of criminal history in determining what critics say is a lenient sentence. "A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.

In contrast, Gary Ewing received [25 to life for petty theft](https://www.newsweek.com/three-strikes-and-youre-133023)(Someone like Ewing, who in 2000 was on parole from a nine-year prison term when he tried to walk out of the pro shop at a Los Angeles country club with three $399 golf clubs concealed in his pants leg.\n\n\[...\]\n\nEwing has been convicted of battery, thefts, burglaries, and drug-related offenses in a series of crimes running back to 1984, when he was 22. Andrade, too, had a series of convictions, including some for residential burglaries, which count as "serious" felonies under the three-strikes law. Ewing's golf-club theft earned him a sentence of 25 years to life.) due to California's three strikes law.
1.1.5.4.5.1.2. Pro: An approach focusing on proportionate punishment still considers the rights of prisoners not to be unduly punished beyond a reasonable sentence \([p. 466](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11572-021-09571-y.pdf)(Consider next proportionality. This refers to matching relationship between the severity of a punishment and the seriousness of the crime: we say that a punishment is ‘proportionate’ if and only if its harshness is commensurate to the gravity of the offense. The classical account of proportionality thus understood is lex talionis, or the principle that the harm one inflicts on others should be inflicted in return. Contemporary penologists, however, hold the more sophisticated view that a punishment is proportionate if and only if its severity is commensurate to the seriousness of the crime, where seriousness is some function of the harm or wrong caused or risked and the offender’s culpability. From this account, then, a killing is more serious than assault; an intentional killing is more serious than a negligent killing; and so on.)\).
1.1.5.4.5.2. Con: Requiring people to meet the same rehabilitation standards would be treating people equally under the law.
1.1.5.4.5.3. Con: Prioritizing punishment does not ensure that people are treated equally if there is a range of possible sentences.
1.1.5.4.5.4. Con: Prisoners being rehabilitated could be held for the same amount of time as they would have been in a punitive system. The only difference would be what the prisoners do while incarcerated.
1.1.5.4.5.5. Pro: Some prisoners receive substantially reduced sentences through [parole](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/parole-board/about)(Our job is to determine if someone is safe to release. We do that with great care, and public safety is our number one priority. We deal with 25,000 cases a year, which are referred to us by the Ministry of Justice once prisoners have served the punishment determined by the courts. Parole Board decisions are solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release. The risk assessment is based on detailed evidence found in the dossier \(a collection of documents relating to the prisoner\) and evidence provided at the oral hearing.) hearings, which consider the extent to which a prisoner has been rehabilitated. This can result in two people who committed the same crime being incarcerated for different amounts of time.
1.1.5.4.5.5.1. Con: Considering factors other than the crime that was committed when sentencing does not represent treating people unequally under the law.
1.1.5.4.6. Con: Rehabilitation being hard to measure objectively is not an argument against its use, but only an acknowledgment of the difficulty of implementing it.
1.1.5.4.6.1. Con: Considering the efficacy of a policy without considering the difficulty of its implementation is not possible.
1.1.5.4.6.2. Con: The difficulty in measuring rehabilitation makes it hard to comprehend the harshness of sentences.
1.1.5.4.6.3. Pro: Many rehabilitation programs are [hard to implement](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/11/probation-led-crash-course-harder-jail-sentence-car-crimes)(Where community rehabilitation ‘is harder than a short-term jail sentence’\n\nIn a Manchester scheme, those convicted of car crimes and given intensive community orders are brought face to face with the consequences\n\n\[...\]\n\nPugh adds: “Many offenders freely admit that the ICO is harder than a short-term jail sentence \[because\] the activities and interventions are much more victim focused.”\n\nDaniel Cherrington, an ex-offender who was convicted of a vehicle crime, testifies to that: “A lot of offenders find that it’s easier to go to prison. If you get sentenced in a magistrates court to six months then you’ll serve four months in prison, take a third off for your guilty plea, you’re out after eight weeks and you’re free. If you’re on an ICO you might not be ready for the help. A lot of people aren’t. You’ve got to want to change, and you’ve got to stop taking drugs and committing crimes. I’m only just getting through it myself.”) and challenging to measure, but this does not mean they are less effective than prison.
1.1.5.4.6.4. Pro: The difficulty in implementing prison rehabilitation programs may be due to the novelty of the idea itself. Over time, the logistics and operational procedures should be clarified, smoothing out the process for other prisons to implement these programs more effectively.
1.1.5.4.7. Pro: Leaving rehabilitation up to the discretion of prisons based on a judgement about an inmate's promise is highly subjective and could be abused in racist or political ways.
1.1.5.4.7.1. Con: Rehabilitation is not up to the discretion of the prison administration or officers. [Dedicated staff or organizations](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/our-expectations/prison-expectations/rehabilitation-and-release-planning/reducing-risk-rehabilitation-and-progression/)(- There is good cooperation and communication between various organisations and departments delivering rehabilitative work in the prison.\n\n\[...\]\n\n- Staff have a good working knowledge of the rehabilitation services available and actively promote them.\n\n- Relevant voluntary and community sector organisations are supported to work with prisoners.\n\n- A named manager is responsible for coordinating the work of voluntary and community sector organisations.\n\n- Partners are encouraged to take part in prison training, for example suicide and self-harm prevention.) are tasked with delivering rehabilitation, while a [parole board](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-parole-system-is-broken-this-is-how-to-fix-it)(Parole is how the state decides when offenders—primarily those who have either been given indeterminate sentences, or determinate sentences after being convicted of more serious crimes—should be given a second chance. The Parole Board reviews their conduct in prison and their attempts at rehabilitation, and decides if they are ready to once more become part of society’s throng.) is normally responsible for determining whether a prisoner is rehabilitated or not.
1.1.6. Con: Some prisoners, especially those who are high-risk or violent, may not want to be rehabilitated.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Rehabilitation assumes a level of motivation on the part of the prisoner. Sufficient punitive action could reform a prisoner out of their offending behavior without the prisoner needing to be motivated to improve themselves.
1.1.6.2. Con: Punishment can make a person receptive to rehabilitation where they might not otherwise be so.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Prisoners are more likely to experience [depression and low mood](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Prisoner-Depression-and-Low-Mood.aspx)(Depression is a common mental problem that makes a person feel downhearted and low. Different kinds of stresses in life can lead to the development of depression and low mood. To be sentenced to prison can be among the most stressful and potentially depressive events in a prisoner’s life.), making them less likely to want to attempt to rehabilitate themselves.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Some people claim that being sent to jail was the [best thing](https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/women/prison-best-thing-happen-to-me-destroyed-women-inside-1188621)(If you had peered through my window when I was growing up with a loving family in Reading, you wouldn’t have guessed I would end up in prison.

I knew I had to change.) that ever happened to them as it forced them to address their self-destructive behaviours.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Nearly one-in-five prisoners refuse to engage with rehabilitative programs \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794253/pdf/nihms766048.pdf)(Jail inmates represent a high-risk, multi-need population. Why do some jail inmates not access available programs and services? Drawn from a longitudinal study, 261 adults were assessed shortly upon incarceration and re-assessed prior to transfer or release from a county jail. Of the participants in need of treatment, 18.5% did not participate in any formal treatment programs or religious programs and services. Untreated inmates were disproportionately young and male and less likely to report pre-incarceration cocaine dependence. Treatment participation varied little as a function of race or symptoms of mental illness. The most common reason for non-participation was the belief that one would not be around long enough to participate in programs. Other reasons were both institution-related and person-related in nature, including doubts about treatment efficacy, stigma concerns, lack of motivation, and lack of programs, especially addressing mental illness.)\).
1.1.6.4. Pro: People who engage in [criminal activity for social or moral reasons](https://www.bl.uk/votes-for-women/articles/suffragettes-violence-and-militancy)(‘If men use explosives and bombs for their own purpose they call it war,’ wrote Christabel Pankhurst in 1913, ‘and the throwing of a bomb that destroys other people is then described as a glorious and heroic deed. Why should a woman not make use of the same weapons as men. It is not only war we have declared. We are fighting for a revolution!’\n\nChristabel’s new tactics oversaw a nationwide bombing and arson campaign that the newspapers quickly dubbed the ‘Suffragette Outrages’.) may never be reformed to consider their actions unacceptable. This may result in them being held indefinitely.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: An indefinite sentence under a rehabilitative system is better than being sentenced under a punitive system.
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: Certain groups of people, like terrorists and activists, are fully committed to their cause and would be unlikely to accept or comply with any form of rehabilitation.
1.1.6.5. Con: Rehabilitation does not require that the offender desire to be rehabilitated. [Aversion therapy](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-aversion-therapy-2796001)(Aversion therapy is a type of behavioral therapy that involves repeat pairing an unwanted behavior with discomfort.1 For example, a person undergoing aversion therapy to stop smoking might receive an electrical shock every time they view an image of a cigarette. The goal of the conditioning process is to make the individual associate the stimulus with unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations.\n\nDuring aversion therapy, the client may be asked to think of or engage in the behavior they enjoy while at the same time being exposed to something unpleasant such as a bad taste, a foul smell, or even mild electric shocks. Once the unpleasant feelings become associated with the behavior, the hope is that unwanted behaviors or actions will begin to decrease in frequency or stop entirely.) uses punishment and reward to condition behavioural responses regardless of the subject's cooperation.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Forcing people to be rehabilitated against their will is akin to [brainwashing](https://www.britannica.com/topic/brainwashing)(brainwashing, also called Coercive Persuasion, systematic effort to persuade nonbelievers to accept a certain allegiance, command, or doctrine. A colloquial term, it is more generally applied to any technique designed to manipulate human thought or action against the desire, will, or knowledge of the individual.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe term is most appropriately used in reference to a program of political or religious indoctrination or ideological remolding. The techniques of brainwashing typically involve isolation from former associates and sources of information; an exacting regimen requiring absolute obedience and humility; strong social pressures and rewards for cooperation; physical and psychological punishments for non-cooperation ranging from social ostracism and criticism, deprivation of food, sleep, and social contacts, to bondage and torture; and continual reinforcement.) and deeply unethical.
1.1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Aversion therapy has been critiqued as inhumane in popular media such as the [1971 film A Clockwork Orange](https://the-take.com/read/what-is-the-ludovico-technique-in-a-clockwork-orange-and-how-does-it-work)(A Clockwork Orange \(1971\) features one of the more uncomfortable scenes in cinema, when Alex \(Malcolm McDowell\) is submitted to the aversion therapy tactics of the fictional Ludovico Technique. In the film, a Dr. Brodsky \(Carl Duering\) of the Ludovico medical facility forces Alex to watch violent images for extended periods of time as his eyes are held open with specula. He’s pumped with nausea-, paralysis- and fear-inducing drugs at the same time, with the objective being the development of a nauseous association when experiencing or thinking about violence, causing an aversion. It’s essentially a mechanical, Pavlovian construct that associates stimuli with negative reinforcement instead of positive.\n\nThe therapy is approved by the UK Minister of the Interior for trials on disturbed and violent individuals like Alex. The hope is to reduce prison overcrowding and cut down on street violence by effectively re-wiring people’s brains against violent thoughts.).
1.1.6.5.1.2. Con: [Brainwashing](https://theconversation.com/the-brainwashing-myth-99272)(As a scholar of religious studies, I’m disheartened by how casually the word “brainwashing” gets thrown around, whether it’s used to describe a politician’s supporters, or individuals who are devoutly religious.\n\nI reject the idea of brainwashing for three reasons: It is pseudoscientific, ignores research-based explanations for human behavior and dehumanizes people by denying their free will.) does not exist and is considered a pseudoscience.
1.1.6.5.2. Pro: Aversion therapy has had [some success](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/aversion-therapy-what-is-definition-get-started-guide/)(Aversion therapy can be effective, but the success rate depends on several factors, and especially on access to a follow-up program. A follow-up program can help the client with relapse prevention and increase the longevity of recovery by ensuring long-term benefits.\n\nThe type of behavior to be corrected also plays a role in the effectiveness of aversion therapy, as it tends to be more effective with some behaviors than others. The stimulus used in therapy is another factor, as the use of electric shocks tends to be less effective than the use of nausea-inducing chemicals.) in challenging [unhealthy habits or addictions](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/aversion-therapy)(Aversion therapy uses conditioning but focuses on creating a negative response to an undesirable stimulus, such as drinking alcohol or using drugs.\n\nMany times, in people with substance use disorders, the body is conditioned to get pleasure from the substance — for instance, it tastes good and makes you feel good. In aversion therapy, the idea is to change that.\n\nThe exact way aversion therapy is performed depends on the undesirable behavior or habit that’s being treated. One commonly used aversive therapy is chemical aversion for alcohol use disorder. The goal is to reduce a person’s craving for alcohol with chemically-induced nausea.\n\nIn chemical aversion, a doctor administers a drug that causes nausea or vomiting if the person being treated drinks alcohol. They then give them alcohol so that the person gets sick. This is repeated until the person begins to associate drinking alcohol with feeling ill and thus no longer craves alcohol.), which often cause criminal behaviour.
1.1.6.5.3. Con: Aversion therapy [loses its effectiveness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-aversion-therapy-2796001)(Generally, aversion therapy tends to be successful while it is still under the direction of a therapist, but relapse rates are high.\n\nOnce the individual is out in the real world and exposed to the stimulus without the presence of the aversive sensation, it is highly likely that they will return to the previous behavior patterns.) over time.
1.1.6.5.3.1. Con: Even if aversion therapy loses its effectiveness over time, the short-term results would remain marginally beneficial.
1.1.6.5.3.2. Pro: Aversion therapy only treats the [symptoms of a condition](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/aversion-therapy#how-it-works)(Aversion therapy is based off the theory of classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is when you unconsciously or automatically learn a behavior due to a specific stimuli. In other words, you learn to respond to something based on repeated interactions with it.\n\nAversion therapy uses conditioning but focuses on creating a negative response to an undesirable stimulus, such as drinking alcohol or using drugs.\n\nMany times, in people with substance use disorders, the body is conditioned to get pleasure from the substance — for instance, it tastes good and makes you feel good. In aversion therapy, the idea is to change that.), not its causes.
1.1.7. Pro: With prisoners finding it difficult to find a job after being released \([p. 1](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/32106/411778-Employment-after-Prison-A-Longitudinal-Study-of-Releasees-in-Three-States.PDF)(Most individuals released from prison held some type of job prior to incarceration and want legal, stable employment upon release. Some criminal justice research suggests that finding and maintaining a legitimate job can reduce former prisoners’ chances of reoffending, and the higher the wage, the less likely it is that individuals will return to crime.\n\nHowever, most former prisoners experience difficulty finding a job after release. During the time spent in prison, many lose work skills and are given little opportunity to gain useful work experience. Moreover, the availability of job-training programs in prison has declined in recent years.)\), a focus on rehabilitation would help ex-convicts obtain gainful employment and reduce recidivism.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Parole violations and unemployment lead to recidivism. The lack of a job itself can cause a [parole violation](https://careerwise.minnstate.edu/exoffenders/find-job/parole-status.html)(Not having a job can affect more than your wallet. The consequences of unemployment can affect all parts of your transition.\n\nLooking for work and finding a job in a reasonable amount of time are often conditions of supervised prison release or parole. That means that if you are not actively looking for work or do not have a job you might be in violation of your release plan.) for some.
1.1.7.2. Con: The aversion many businesses have towards recruiting ex-convicts is most likely [because they committed a crime](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jun/28/after-the-why-employers-should-give-ex-offenders-a-working-chance)(A YouGov survey \[pdf\] commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions in 2016 found that 50% of employers would not consider employing an ex-offender, regardless of the offence or sentence received.\n\n“Employers have a negative picture of what they think of as an ex-offender,” says Dominic Headley, a legal officer at Nacro, a social justice charity that supports people with criminal convictions and offers a free helpline to employers seeking advice on how to deal with employees and criminal records.\n\n“There is a perception among employers that \[people with a criminal conviction\] won’t be highly skilled and that they won’t be reliable,” he says.), not because they were punished in prison. Therefore, focusing on rehabilitation will probably not improve prisoner employability.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Prisoners who willingly engage with rehabilitation programs are more likely to find employment following their release \([p. 3](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296320/impact-of-experience-in-prison-on-employment-status-of-longer-sentenced-prisoners.pdf)(Other factors directly associated with increased reporting of employment after release were identified. These were:\n\n- Participation in paid work in custody. Prisoners who had worked while in prison were more likely to be in employment shortly after release.\n\n- Vocational training in custody. Prisoners who had attended vocational training in prison were more likely to securing employment shortly after release.\n\n- Accredited programmes to address offending behaviour and reduce drug or alcohol use in custody. Prisoners enrolled on accredited programmes to address offending behaviour and to reduce drug or alcohol use were more likely to be in employment shortly after release.\n\n- Qualifications before custody. Prisoners who had reported holding school-level qualifications \(GCSE and A levels\) were more likely to be in employment shortly after release \(compared with those with no qualifications\).)\).
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Rehabilitation initiatives like [Project Return](https://projectreturninc.org/why-we-exist/)(Through PRO Employment, our first social enterprise, we create meaningful employment opportunities for the people we serve by hiring them ourselves. They gain real-world work experience and income as Project Return’s transitional employees, and then go on to become the proud and successful employees of Middle Tennessee companies, and a vital part of the workforce of this community. Through our second social enterprise, PRO Housing, we create affordable rental homes for hard-working men and women who’ve left prison behind.) hire former prisoners upon their release to give them work experience and subsequently help them find work with partnered organizations.
1.1.7.4. Con: Many criminals lack opportunities following prison because of their [lack of educational attainment](https://sites.northwestern.edu/npep/benefits-of-prison-education/)(There are increased and improved employment opportunities available for those formerly incarcerated people who engaged in prison education programs, and reentry is far smoother and more successful for those who took classes in prison, especially insofar as gainful employment is one of the defining features of successful reentry.), not necessarily their criminal record.
1.1.7.4.1. Pro: Educational attainment can drop recidivism rates to [nearly null](https://blackstone.edu/rehabilitation-through-education/)(However, receiving education while incarcerated or immediately upon release has proven:\n\n- With vocational training, the recidivism rate drops to approximately 30%.\n- With an Associate degree, recidivism drops to 13.7%.\n- With a Bachelor’s degree, recidivism drops to 5.6%.\n- With a Master’s degree, recidivism is so low that it’s effectively 0%.), depending on the qualification level.
1.1.7.5. Pro: If ex-convicts cannot gain employment after release, they are effectively [being punished twice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/zn8nvw/ex-cons-remember-their-worst-jobs-after-being-released-from-prison)(Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare. Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through "work-release." Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice, over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release.\n\nThat said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process.): once during their sentence, and again when they are faced with a life of unemployment upon release.
1.1.7.5.1. Pro: Former prisoners struggle to have a normal life mainly due to the [stigma](https://www.communitypsychology.com/paying-time-after-time/)(Our findings illustrate the prevalence of criminal record stigma and discrimination. Individuals may withdraw or keep their record a secret to protect themselves from judgement and mistreatment. Our findings also suggest that criminal record stigma can lead to decreased quality of life for individuals with criminal records, and that their quality of life may particularly be hindered when they feel the need to keep their criminal record a secret.\n\nResults\n\n- It was common for participants to feel that the general public looked down on people with criminal records and to have personally experienced multiple forms of criminal record-based discrimination.\n\n- Survey participants did not see themselves as flawed just because they had a criminal record.\n\n- Criminal record stigma was linked to decreased quality of life among our participants.) associated with a criminal record. If prisons focussed on rehabilitation, and if people trusted that these treatments were effective, former prisoners would inevitably suffer less from this stigma.
1.1.8. Pro: Prisons [exacerbate recidivism](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/five-things-about-deterrence)(Some policymakers and practitioners believe that increasing the severity of the prison experience enhances the “chastening” effect, thereby making individuals convicted of an offense less likely to commit crimes in the future. In fact, scientists have found no evidence for the chastening effect. Prisons may exacerbate recidivism. Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate, not reduce, recidivism. Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes.), instead of [reducing the incidence](https://academic.oup.com/aler/article-abstract/13/1/103/183298)(The authors examine the impact of prison conditions on future criminal behavior. The take over is based on a unique dataset on the post-release behavior of about twenty thousand Italian former prison inmates. The authors use variation in prison assignment as a means of identifying the effects of prison overcrowding, deaths in prison, and degree of isolation on the probability of reoffending. They do not find compellingevidence of \(specific\) deterrent effects of experienced prison severity. The measures of prison severity do not reduce the probability of recidivism. Instead, all point estimates suggest that harsh prison conditions increase post-release criminal activity, though they are not always precisely estimated.).
1.1.8.1. Pro: Almost half of released prisoners in the US are rearrested within eight years, while almost a quarter of released prisoners are reincarcerated in the same period \([p. 5](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2016/recidivism_overview.pdf)(Over an eight year follow-up period, almost one-half of federal offenders released in 2005 \(49.3%\) were rearrested for a new crime or rearrested for a violation of supervision conditions.\n\nAlmost one-third \(31.7%\) of the offenders were also reconvicted, and one-quarter \(24.6%\) of the offenders were reincarcerated over the same study period.)\).
1.1.8.2. Con: Some criminals, such as thieves or sexual offenders, are [deterred from reoffending](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706820?journalCode=jle)(By contrast, we find that exposure to offenders in the same specialization deters inmates from recidivism for violent offenses, including sexual offenses and robbery.) if they are placed with similar offenders in prison.
1.1.8.3. Con: Given the high recidivism rates in most justice systems, one way to ensure prisoners do not reoffend is to prevent them from being released.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: Former prisoners won’t have much motivation to stay out of prison if they have no chance of a normal life due to a lack of support. Keeping them incarcerated rather than releasing them is safer.
1.1.8.3.2. Con: For most offenses, incarcerating someone for life is [disproportionate](https://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/what-are-the-most-common-crimes-in-the-united-states/)(Have you ever wondered what are the most common crimes in the United States? According to statistics obtained from the FBI, a property crime was reported about every three seconds in the U.S., and a violent crime was reported about every 22 seconds. Those are sobering statistics. Contrary to what most people think, property crimes are by far the most reported crimes in the United States, not violent crimes; property crimes are about ten times more prevalent than violent crimes.

1.1.8.3.3. Con: A [short prison term](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/criminal-sentencing_why-switzerland-is-lenient-with-criminals/44655910)(According to Killias, the view that short prison sentences are damaging has become a set-in-stone dogma in Switzerland. But there is no scientific evidence that the risk of recidivism increases after a short prison term. And the fact that punishments should also serve justice and stabilise social order is sometimes overlooked.\n\nThe Swiss reform was criticised and has already been revised. But Koch says avoidance of short prison terms has basically remained policy. “For crime prevention, other factors play a role in any case,” Koch says.\n\n“The average length of a prison sentence only plays a small role in the deterrent effect of a punishment,” Matefi says. “For crime prevention, the risk of having to face any kind of punishment – of being caught and punished – is much more decisive.” And in this respect, Switzerland measures up quite well in international comparisons.) does not increase the risk of recidivism. Giving prisoners longer or lifetime sentences is therefore unnecessary.
1.1.9. Pro: Criminals are often products of their [social contexts](https://open.lib.umn.edu/socialproblems/chapter/8-4-explaining-crime/)(Social structure theories all stress that crime results from the breakdown of society’s norms and social organization and in this sense fall under the functional perspective outlined in Chapter 1 “Understanding Social Problems”. They trace the roots of crime to problems in the society itself rather than to biological or psychological problems inside individuals. By doing so, they suggest the need to address society’s social structure in order to reduce crime. Several social structure theories exist.) \([p. i](https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1877&context=student_scholarship)(Conclusively, while there is a positive relationship between incarceration rates and crimes rates, the correlation is not strong nor consistent enough to make a solid argument; rather, the data suggest other factors, such as the education, per capita income and unemployment rate, are contributors to the rise of crime, thus, further research needs to be taken into consideration because incarceration rates cannot be the sole explanation as to why there is an increase of crime rates throughout the United States.)\). Returning reformed citizens to help improve these communities could provide the biggest benefit overall.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Many criminals were raised in environments with values that diverge from mainstream society.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: By providing support and guidance and treating criminality as a mental health issue, criminals can recover faster \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266968/pdf/nihms-291271.pdf)(The purpose of this research synthesis was to examine treatment effects across studies of the service providers to offenders with mental illness. Meta-analytic techniques were applied to 26 empirical studies obtained from a review of 12,154 research documents. Outcomes of interest in this review included measures of both psychiatric and criminal functioning. Although metaanalytic results are based on a small sample of available studies, results suggest interventions with offenders with mental illness effectively reduced symptoms of distress, improving offender’s ability to cope with their problems, and resulted in improved behavioral markers including institutional adjustment and behavioral functioning.)\).
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: The [broken windows theory](https://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/what-works-in-policing/research-evidence-review/broken-windows-policing/)(What is Broken Windows Policing?\n\nThe broken windows model of policing was first described in 1982 in a seminal article by Wilson and Kelling. Briefly, the model focuses on the importance of disorder \(e.g., broken windows\) in generating and sustaining more serious crime. Disorder is not directly linked to serious crime; instead, disorder leads to increased fear and withdrawal from residents, which then allows more serious crime to move in because of decreased levels of informal social control.\n\nThe police can play a key role in disrupting this process. If they focus in on disorder and less serious crime in neighborhoods that have not yet been overtaken by serious crime, they can help reduce fear and resident withdrawal. Promoting higher levels of informal social control will help residents themselves take control of their neighborhood and prevent serious crime from infiltrating) argues that visible signs of low-level criminal disorder are more likely to normalise criminality to people living in those areas.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: When young offenders are forced to remove graffiti from the walls of buildings, it sends a clear message that [crime will not be tolerated](https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/12801585.opinion-why-justice-must-be-seen-to-be-done/)(THE clean-up project in Summerston where young vandals are removing graffiti sends out a powerful message.\n\nNot only will the youths involved realise there are consequences for their actions but the wider community will see anti-social behaviour being tackled head-on.\n\nToo often, people feel this kind of nuisance crime goes unpunished, encouraging further vandalism.).
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: Graffiti removal programs and street vigilance to prevent tagging are typically [prohibitively expensive](https://worldcrunch.com/culture-society/the-perverse-effect-of-street-art-on-neighborhood-gentrification)(In Paris’ 20th arrondissement, “the city created a specific training course for staff in charge of cleaning the walls, to teach them to distinguish between random tags and graffiti art," explains Bruno Julliard, deputy mayor in charge of culture. But most of the time, cities don’t bother with the distinction and simply ban what they consider to be an illegal appropriation of urban space. In France, spray-painting a wall is punished by a fine of up to 1,500 euros – more if the graffiti is on a public building. It costs cities a fortune to remove tags and street art works – 4.5 million euros a year in Paris.); [middle-class and wealthier neighborhoods](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-13-me-22279-story.html)(It is also increasingly costly. A state Department of Transportation study found that public and private spending on graffiti removal in Los Angeles County totaled $66 million in 1991 and, according to some estimates, now exceeds $100 million annually.\n\nStill, the battle is being lost, officials acknowledge. And residents of newly afflicted neighborhoods--from affluent stretches of Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley to middle-class areas of Altadena and Palmdale\[.\]) are the only ones that can afford such programs, furthering the broken windows theory.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Public funding isn't necessary for people to help the police arrest graffiti artists and taggers; communities can [police themselves](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-13-me-22279-story.html)(On a recent Saturday night, about 40 volunteers in the Wilmington area stood on rooftops with binoculars, patrolled in their cars or parked and watched selected targets popular with taggers. Several Los Angeles Police Department patrol cars assigned to the mission were standing by.\n\nLew Prulitsky, a Wilmington real estate agent who helped organize the patrols, said the volunteers alerted police to a handful of vandals and several dozen curfew violators and chased several of them.\n\nSuspects were taken to the Harbor Division police station where another group of volunteers called their parents. If the parents and the taggers were willing to help clean up the graffiti, the volunteers could recommend their release.) in order to rid themselves of the unsightly contributions.
1.1.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: Forcing criminals to clean up their graffiti serves as both punishment and rehabilitation, as the offender would earn more appreciation for public sanitation workers.
1.1.9.1.2.2. Con: The broken windows theory makes a [classist and unfair connection](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/12/edward-banfield-the-racist-classist-origins-of-broken-windows-policing.html)(But this is America, and, in America, pre-emptive incarceration is a political nonstarter. The principle behind this idea, however, is at the root of broken windows policing: the idea that lower-class men are inherently dangerous and untrustworthy and are likely to commit crimes in the future even if they’re not doing so today. To put it another way, there are times where “the essential welfare of individuals must be sacrificed for the good health of society,” as Banfield wrote.\n\nIn their 1982 Atlantic article, titled “Broken Windows,” Kelling and Wilson argued that \[...\] A preponderance of lower-class layabouts makes a neighborhood feel unsafe to its law-abiding residents; these residents hunker down or disassociate or move away, and soon the neighborhood actually becomes unsafe. Better, then, to stop this process before it starts, and to target minor deviant behaviors before they become something worse.) between areas with limited government investment and criminality.
1.1.9.1.2.2.1. Pro: People in low-income areas often do not have the disposable income available to fix superficial yet obvious damage in their communities. The prevalence of this damage has nothing to do with criminality.
1.1.9.1.2.2.2. Pro: The government should be held responsible for cleaning up the signs of physical damage and vandalism in all communities, not just wealthy ones.
1.1.9.1.2.2.3. Con: Low-income areas tend to have higher degrees of public property damage as residents pay [less taxes](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/poverty/543000-huge-new-study-shows-homes-in-poor-areas-are-taxed-at-twice/)(Cities, counties, school districts and special districts in the United States raise roughly $500 billion per year in property taxes, research shows — roughly 70 percent of local taxes. A new study reveals that much of that is paid by low-income property owners, who are taxed at twice the rate as those living in rich neighborhoods.\n\n“In addition to violating principles of good taxation, property tax regressivity often violates the law. The 14th amendment’s equal protection clause requires that all property of the same class–e.g., residential–be taxed at the same rate,” author Christopher Berry, a researcher and professor at the University of Chicago, argues in the study, noting that courts interpret this clause to protect property owners from intentional and systematic discrimination.) \(in real terms\) to pay for upkeep. There is, therefore, a real connection between low-income areas and visible criminal damage.
1.1.9.1.3. Con: Criminals come from various backgrounds, suggesting that criminals are not raised in environments separate from mainstream society.
1.1.9.1.3.1. Pro: Most white collar crime is committed by [educated individuals](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/into-the-mind-of-white-collar-criminals-18306)(Sutherland pointed out that white-collar criminals are quite different from street criminals, in that they generally are married, have an above average education and a high income. They also tend to be homeowners and have somewhat strong ties to their community, family and religion. They seemingly have no reason to break the law, so when their crime is detected, a common reaction is incredulity.) from privileged backgrounds.
1.1.9.1.3.2. Con: Wealthier criminals might have [grown up with the attitude](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/affluenza-teen-ethan-couch-released-prison-drunk-driving-texas-a8285541.html)(In 2013, at the age of 16, Couch hit and killed four pedestrians in a drunk driving crash. Two of the passengers in his pickup truck were injured; one was paralysed.\n\nProsecutors at the time argued he should serve the maximum of 20 years in prison for four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault. Defence attorneys pushed for rehabilitation instead.\n\nA psychologist called by the defence suggested Couch suffered from “affluenza,” or a lack of personal responsibility spurred by his affluent upbringing.\n\n“He never learned that sometimes you don’t get your way,” psychologist Gary Miller said at the trial. “He had the cars and he had the money. He had freedoms that no young man would be able to handle.”) that there would not be any consequences if they were ever caught.
1.1.9.1.3.2.1. Pro: Wealthier people are often able to avoid prison through their [connections and wealth](https://www.forensicscolleges.com/blog/follow-the-money/white-collar-prison)(In October of 2001, Robert Durst was charged with the murder and dismemberment of his neighbor. Bail was set at $300,000. Durst paid, and was released. A week later, he didn’t show up for a hearing and became listed as a fugitive. Two months later, and several states away, he was arrested for shoplifting. He had $500 in cash on his person. His rental car contained another $37,000 in cash, two guns, and the driver’s license of the murder victim. Durst proceeded to hire John Waldron, one of Pennsylvania’s “Super Lawyers.” Even though Durst admitted to dismembering the victim’s body, he was acquitted of the murder.\n\nBoth cases took place in Texas, but the similarities end there. The disparities are black and white: Bland, a summer program associate at a small university, was poor, and Durst, the scion of one of New York’s wealthiest real estate families, was obscenely rich; \n\n\[...\] \n\nIt’s a formula that repeats itself far too often in the US criminal justice system.).
1.1.9.1.3.3. Con: Petty criminals likely carried out minor crimes [without any consequences](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/preventing-involvement-crime)(Children are also less likely to get into trouble if their parents have an interest in their school life and they have good relationships with their teachers. This all helps to encourage children to go to school as often as possible.\n\nChildren are less likely to offend if their parents can help them to become involved in activities or interests in their local community. This can include youth clubs, sports clubs, uniformed groups and church groups.) from their families or the community, which emboldened them to continue to do so.
1.1.9.1.3.4. Pro: [Stability in the home](http://marripedia.org/effects_of_family_structure_on_crime)(Even in high-crime inner-city neighborhoods, well over 90 percent of children from safe, stable homes do not become delinquents. By contrast only 10 percent of children from unsafe, unstable homes in these neighborhoods avoid crime.) is likely the most important factor in determining who will become a criminal.
1.1.9.1.4. Con: Law and order allow people [equal access to opportunities](https://www.chanukahaction.org/?p=32), providing everyone with a level playing field that education and care alone would not provide.
1.1.9.1.5. Pro: Family can have a considerable impact on criminality.
1.1.9.1.5.1. Pro: Children born into unstable families are unlikely to have been taught a consistent ethical framework and are more likely to become criminals later in life \([p. 13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6889959/pdf/nihms-1016663.pdf)(Prior literature suggests these unstable family backgrounds would have negative implications for adolescent risk behavior and transition-to-adulthood experiences \(e.g. Fomby and Bosick 2013\). The findings presented in this article suggest that these unstable family contexts shape criminal outcomes even in adulthood. Our findings predict that whites who experience a single change in maternal union status during childhood are significantly more likely to be arrested in adulthood. Those who experience high levels of family instability \(three or more transitions\) are not only more likely to be arrested, but are also significantly more likely to experience incarceration in adulthood. These findings point to a need for criminologists to move beyond the classic, yet static focus on “broken homes” toward measures of family instability, which more accurately capture the dynamic nature of modern family contexts.)\).
1.1.9.1.5.2. Pro: The sons of organized crime bosses often follow in their father's footsteps \([p. 345](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10610-018-9381-6.pdf)(In terms of prevalence in official record crime statistics, the results show that a large majority of the organized crime offenders’ sons seem to follow in their fathers’ footsteps. This is not the case for daughters, as half of them have a criminal record, but primarily for only one minor crime. Intergenerational transmission seems to be facilitated by mediating risk factors, inadequate parenting skills of the mother, the “famous” or violent reputation of the father, and deviant social learning. If we want to break the intergenerational chain of crime and violence, the results seem to suggest that an accumulation of protective factors seem to be effective, particularly for girls. For girls, supervision from a child protection service also seems to work quite well. For boys, we might need a different approach to prevent them from offending.)\).
1.1.9.1.5.3. Con: Many young people claim [factors other than their family](https://www.teachingtimes.com/family-time-survey_010610/)(Many of the children in the UK found technology and social networking more important than other aspects of life, including their family, according to a new poll of eight to 15-year-olds for National Family Week. It found 40% of girls identified Facebook as one of the most important things in their lives - compared with 6% of boys. The study, which surveyed 3,000 parents and 1,000 children across the UK, reveals parents overestimate the role they play in their child's life.) are more important in influencing their behavior.
1.1.9.1.5.4. Pro: The [relationship quality](https://marripedia.org/effects_of_family_structure_on_crime)(The relationship between parents, not just the relationship between mother and child, has a powerful effect on very young children. Children react to quarreling parents by disobeying, crying, hitting other children, and in general being much more antisocial than their peers. And, significantly, quarreling or abusive parents do not generally vent their anger equally on all their children. Such parents tend to vent their anger on their more difficult children. This parental hostility and physical and emotional abuse of the child shapes the future delinquent.\n\nMost delinquents are children who have been abandoned by their fathers. They are often deprived also of the love and affection they need from their mother. Inconsistent parenting, family turmoil, and multiple other stresses \(such as economic hardship and psychiatric illnesses\) that flow from these disagreements compound the rejection of these children by these parents, many of whom became criminals during childhood.) between the parents, as well as between the parents and the child, is a determining factor in criminality.
1.1.9.2. Con: Treating all criminals as victims of circumstance will result in criminals not taking responsibility for their actions.
1.1.9.2.1.

1.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: A criminal's unfortunate background does not negate the suffering of their victims.
1.1.9.2.1.3. Con: Understanding why someone behaved in an immoral way does not necessarily excuse their behavior.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: Even if criminals should be held directly responsible for their actions, causing them suffering through punishment is unacceptable.
1.1.9.2.3. Con: Punishment is not an effective deterrent because many criminals likely [do not have an alternative to criminality](https://theconversation.com/do-criminals-freely-decide-to-commit-offences-how-the-courts-decide-133751)(When a person has done something very bad, we are motivated to look for evidence that supports blaming them and to downplay evidence that might excuse them by showing that they lacked free will.).
1.1.9.2.3.1.

The stigma of imprisonment may make the criminal even more desperate upon release, pushing them into a cycle of criminality \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788463/pdf/nihms665217.pdf)(Research has rarely considered criminal offenders’ psychological responses to stigma, but these responses may significantly influence behavior after release from jail/prison. Jail inmates’ perceived and anticipated stigma was assessed prior to release from jail/prison \(N = 163\), and outcomes were assessed one year post-release \(N = 371\). We hypothesized that perceived stigma would predict poor adjustment in several domains \(i.e. recidivism, substance dependence, mental health symptoms, community adjustment\) through anticipated stigma. Results showed that perceived stigma predicted worse community adjustment through anticipated stigma, and this varied by race. Results are explored from an interdisciplinary perspective.)\).
1.1.9.2.3.1.1. Pro: People committing crimes out of necessity is a reflection of the inability of society to provide for its citizens, not a condemnation of people without a choice.

1.1.9.2.3.1.2.1. Con: State-funded rehabilitation programs would increase the number of people eligible for these certificates.
1.1.9.2.3.1.2.2. Con: If the crime committed out of desperation is aggravated robbery, then the prisoner is not eligible for a certificate of employability. Those prisoners still deserve a way to break the cycle of criminality.

1.1.9.2.3.2. Con: A criminal believing they have no realistic alternatives does not excuse their crime.
1.1.9.2.4. Con: The theory of social disorganization, which proposes that crime is primarily a result of local conditions, has been experiencing a resurgence in popularity in recent decades \([pp. 374-375](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charis-Kubrin/publication/255699203_New_Directions_in_Social_Disorganization_Theory/links/0046352bd0f7365951000000/New-Directions-in-Social-Disorganization-Theory.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(According to the theory, poverty, residential mobility, ethnic heterogeneity, and weak social networks decrease a neighborhood’s capacity to control the behavior of people in public, and hence increase the likelihood of crime. The theory was first advanced by Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay \(1969/1942\), who discovered that high delinquency rates persisted in certain Chicago neighborhoods for long periods of time despite changes in the racial and ethnic composition of these communities—a finding that led to the conclusion that neighborhood ecological conditions shape crime rates over and above the characteristics of individual residents.\n\nThe theory fell out of favor in subsequent years, but it has experienced a revival in the past two decades beginning with the seminal works of Kornhauser \(1978\), Stark \(1987\), Bursik \(1988\), Sampson and Groves \(1989\), and Bursik and Grasmick \(1993\).)\).
1.1.9.2.5. Con: If society is to blame for criminals' behavior, it is entirely appropriate for governments to choose criminal justice approaches that reflect that reality.

But social variables may not be sufficient to account for the wide range of variance observed in criminal behavior. For example, based on all accounts, Jeremy Strohmeyer was adopted into a loving and supportive environment. An investigation into Strohmeyer’s biological background, however, revealed a history of schizophrenia and criminality in his biological parents. Perhaps other factors, alone or in concert with previously identified environmental variables, may better explain why some individuals travel down a criminal path.)\).

"But the outcomes of their lives are often very different indeed."\n\nIt is an intriguing discovery and it forms the core of a new awareness of the behaviour of genes and their interactions with the environment, one that may explain the baffling roots of human variation, though Spector, when he started his study, had slightly less ambitious goals.).

Being in school keeps potential criminals off the streets and possibly exposes them to the right sort of peers and social attitudes.\n\nThere is also evidence that a lack of education is associated with criminal behaviour. For example, studies of the US jail population in the 1990s showed that most inmates had not finished high school.\n\nThe new research concludes that the existence of a causal crime-reducing effect of education has potentially important implications for longer-term efforts aimed at reducing crime.

In this paper, we show that high unemployment rates are an important factor contributing substantially to both property and violent crime rates. Our findings rely on the fact, that previous studies fail to control for the influence of crime fundamentals, such as alcohol consumption, that vary with the business cycle and thus impart a downward bias to estimates of unemployment effects.

Unsurprisingly it had a mixed reception, and his research into ghosts, poltergeists, telepathy and levitation appropriately disappeared into the ether. It did, however, add to the general discrediting of Lombroso’s ideas over the years, and for some time his work was viewed as being more of curiosity value than anything else. This was accentuated by the increasing popularity of eugenics and the use of biological theories of crime by the Nazis to justify the murder millions of people. In the postwar period other, more sociological, explanations for criminal behaviour became more popular, and thus biological theories were largely rejected.).
1.1.9.9.2.1.

Pro: One man developed [paedophilic](https://ebin.pub/mind-shift-how-culture-transformed-the-human-brain-0198801637-9780198801634.html)(Yet now he began collecting magazines and websites focusing on paedophilia and making sexual advances towards his prepubescent stepdaughter.\n\[...\]\nHowever, at this point, he began experiencing violent headaches and loss of balance. Rushed to hospital, a scan revealed that he was suffering from a brain tumour. Amazingly, once this was surgically removed, the man’s headaches and balance problems disappeared, but so did his paedophilic urges. Seven months later \[...\] he became concerned when he again started to develop persistent headaches and a renewed interest in child pornography. The tumour that apparently had caused his paedophilia had returned. When it was removed, he was once again cured. Scientists concluded that the tumour interfered with the orbifrontal cortex which helps to regulate social behaviour and likely exacerbated the man’s pre-­existing interest in pornography, ‘manifesting sexual deviancy and paedophilia’.) urges as a result of a brain tumour.
1.1.9.9.3.2. Pro: Young offenders are between [three and six times](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/ref2014/impact/lifesciences/braininjury/)(Professor Huw Williams, Associate Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology explained: “A few years ago I arranged a study visit to a prison, one of the inmates asked me why, when he pressed a part of his head, he experienced odd visual sensations. I noticed an area of his shaved head where it looked as though there was a piece of skull missing. It led me to wonder what the true scale of head injury was in the prison population – and whether their needs were being met.\n\n“Our work points to the fact that a childhood brain injury increases the likelihood of someone committing a violent crime by adulthood. Shockingly, around 60 per cent of young adult offenders report having suffered brain injuries, between three and six times as many as in the population at large. When untreated though, they seem to magnify other problems, from hyperactivity to drug misuse.) more likely to have brain injuries than the population at large.
1.1.9.9.3.3. Con: Brain abnormalities and injuries are mainly associated with [violent crime](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/ref2014/impact/lifesciences/braininjury/)(Our work points to the fact that a childhood brain injury increases the likelihood of someone committing a violent crime by adulthood.). Brain problems cannot help explain non-violent crimes, such as embezzlement or identity theft.
1.1.9.9.4. Pro: People with a propensity toward crime may have a mental illness \([p. 476](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hodgins-Sheilagh/publication/271291717_Mental_Disorder_Intellectual_Deficiency_and_Crime/links/550d50de0cf2128741635503/Mental-Disorder-Intellectual-Deficiency-and-Crime.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(It was found that men with major mental disorders were 21/2 times more likely than men with no disorder or handicap to be registered for a criminal offense and four times more likely to be registered for a violent offense. Women with major disorders were five times more likely than women with no disorder or handicap to be registered for an offense and 27 times more likely to be registered for a violent offense. \[...\] The results of this investigation confirm and extend previous findings indicating that individuals with major mental disorders and those with intellectual handicaps are at increased risk for offending and for violent offending.)\).
1.1.9.9.4.1. Con: The US prison system is being used as a [substitute](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/)(At Cook County Jail, an estimated one in three inmates has some form of mental illness. At least 400,000 inmates currently behind bars in the United States suffer from some type of mental illness—a population larger than the cities of Cleveland, New Orleans, or St. Louis—according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. NAMI estimates that between 25 and 40 percent of all mentally ill Americans will be jailed or incarcerated at some point in their lives.) for proper mental health services and can increase the likelihood of, and can even cause, [serious mental illnesses](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/05/13/mentalhealthimpacts/)(We often talk about the disturbingly high numbers of people with mental health disorders locked up in prisons and jails. But less attention is paid to the ways in which incarceration itself perpetuates this problem by creating and worsening symptoms of mental illness. Research shows that, while it varies from person to person, incarceration is linked to mood disorders including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.) among prisoners.
1.1.9.9.4.2. Con: People with mental illnesses are much more likely to be [victims of crimes](https://cmhadurham.ca/finding-help/the-myth-of-violence-and-mental-illness/)(In today’s media reports about mental illness, there is a tendency to emphasize a supposed link between violence and mental illness. News stories regularly suggest that there is a strong connection between mental illness and crime. But the majority of people who are violent do not suffer from mental illnesses. In fact, people with a mental illness are more likely to be the victims, rather than the perpetrators of violence.\n\nBecause the media often quotes dramatic statistics to underscore their case, a look at the broader picture is essential. For example, studies have found that the rate of violence \(defined as threatening, hitting, fighting or otherwise hurting another person\) for people with mental illness is 3 to 5 times the rate of the general public. On its own, this is a worrying figure. But it is similar to how much more violent men are than women.) than perpetrators.
1.1.9.9.4.3. Pro: [Criminal insanity](https://www.britannica.com/topic/insanity)(insanity, in criminal law, condition of mental disorder or mental defect that relieves persons of criminal responsibility for their conduct. Tests of insanity used in law are not intended to be scientific definitions of mental disorder; rather, they are expected to identify persons whose incapacity is of such character and extent that criminal responsibility should be denied on grounds of social expediency and justice.) exists as a defense in most jurisdictions.
1.1.9.9.5. Pro: Some scientists have hypothesized that certain criminals’ bodies [cannot break down signalling chemicals sufficiently](https://www.businessinsider.com/psychopath-gene-2015-7?r=US&IR=T)(People with a variant of the gene, called MAOA-L, produce less of the protein that breaks down these signaling chemicals, which in turn causes them to build up. An excess of these chemicals, scientists believe, leads to impulsive behavior \(such as as hypersexuality\), sleep disorders, mood swings, and violent tendencies.), which could lead to impulsive behaviour, hypersexuality, mood swings, and violent tendencies.
1.2. Pro: Focusing prisons on rehabilitation is morally acceptable.
1.2.1. Pro: Prisons must prioritise rehabilitation because highly punitive sentences harm prisoners.
1.2.1.1. Con: Criminals should not be dealt with uniformly. Those willing to be rehabilitated and minor offenders should be given the chance to be rehabilitated, but it is appropriate for serious criminals to be dealt with more harshly.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Determining who is willing to change could be incredibly difficult to carry out in practice.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Rehabilitation is positive for those inmates who are [involved in rehabilitating](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3720)(Inmates and outside organizations can operate rehabilitation programs with CDCR approval. These programs are generally referred to as Inmate Leisure Time Activity Groups \(ILTAGs\). Specifically, ILTAGs are groups initiated by inmates and volunteers that provide various rehabilitation opportunities—such as self‑help support, creative writing, or peer mentorship. These programs allow inmates to be engaged in activities outside state‑funded rehabilitation programs and/or work assignments. \(Work assignments allow inmates to earn wages for jobs they perform within prisons, such as janitorial work or cooking meals.\) Some of the programs require inmates to complete a specific rehabilitative curriculum, such as a one‑year long violence prevention and life skills program. Other programs have a less clearly defined curriculum, such as the various self‑help support groups in prisons.) as well as those receiving rehabilitation.
1.2.1.3. Con: Being punitive is possible without being excessively or harshly so.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Prisons are expected to treat prisoners humanely, suggesting that no prison should be excessively punitive \([p. 5](https://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/humanity_in_prison.pdf)(All prison systems, in all countries, are expected to treat detained people with humanity. However, it is not possible to find a simple explanation of what ‘humanity’ means in this context. A definition needs to be sought through an analysis of the large body of United Nations conventions, norms, standards and guidelines, supplemented by the conventions and texts of regional human rights bodies such as the Council of Europe. It is sometimes argued that ‘humanity’ is too complex to measure and too subjective for its delivery to be audited. We do not agree. Experience from around the world shows that it is possible to produce a workable definition.)\).
1.2.1.4. Pro: Prisons themselves are a punishment because they are inherently dangerous and unsuitable places for human beings to live in.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: For [some people](https://www.thespec.com/news/world/2014/03/22/choosing-prison-why-life-behind-bars-seems-better-than-freedom.html)(He is the guy, after all, who wanted to go to prison.\n\nThis briefly made him something of an Internet sensation. Last December, he told a judge that he had demanded money from a St. Joseph convenience store clerk for the sole purpose of getting himself sent back to prison. The story hit regional newspapers; the Huffington Post wrote a snarky recap of the case.), prison is not a punishment but rather a more stable, familiar place than home.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: People like [Charles Bronson](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2013/aug/18/charles-bronson-time-released)(That he has been a problem for the prison system since his conviction in 1974, when he was sentenced to seven years for the £26 armed robbery of a post office when he was just 21, is beyond dispute. By his own admission, he was a handful as a youngster. Prisons do not like people they can't control and Bronson's response to much of what he saw as the system's petty and demeaning treatment of prisoners was violence.), who crave physical power, are unlikely to be intimidated by a prison system that provides an environment where they can be dominant.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Most people would view prison as a negative; some people even have [Carcerophobia](https://phobia.fandom.com/wiki/Carcerophobia)(Carcerophobia \(from Latin carcer meaning "prison, jail"\) is the fear of prison. Anybody can suffer this fear even though they done nothing illegal in their lives. Sufferers would usually have obsessive thoughts about what's the life is like in the prison. Many carcerophobes would feel worry about spending the rest of the life in the prison the most. Sufferers would do everything to stay out of trouble. They may be afraid for parents or other family member to call the police. If the sufferer has done a misbehaving thing or even did something bad accidentally, they may panic in terror, with symptoms like sweating, obsessive worries, rapid breathing, and sense of being trapped. Seeing the police officer or even seeing the police car from a distance may also cause them to panic. The phobia is often treated most using relaxation stratagies, or with other methods like cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychotherapy.), a genuine fear of prison.
1.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: For some people, prison is preferable to being a free member of society.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Some people get arrested on purpose: either to escape their reality or to take advantage of the [amenities available](https://www.businessinsider.com/jail-getting-arrested-deliberately-2018-3)(That was the case for Lance Brown, a homeless man from Columbus, Georgia, who in 2012 hurled a brick through the town courthouse building and spent nine months in jail awaiting his trial. \n\nBrown said he vandalized the building because in jail, "someone's going to offer me a sandwich and drink." Brown was eventually sentenced to one more month in jail, according to the Associated Press.\n\n"The unfortunate circumstances in which Mr. Brown found himself cannot be a justification for destroying property of the United States," US Attorney Michael Moore said at the time.\n\nBrown's case was far from unique: The Guardian reported in 2010 that a fifth of homeless people have committed crimes solely to spend the night off the streets.) in prisons.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Some inmates [prefer prison life](https://www.businessinsider.com/jail-getting-arrested-deliberately-2018-3)(Most people try to avoid getting caught breaking the law.\n\nBut in some unusual cases, people go out of their way to get caught committing a crime, all because they want to go to jail.\n\nSome of them saw jail as a way to get healthcare, or escape the cold. Others simply wanted to find out what jail was like, to name a few.\n\nWe've compiled seven cases in which people intentionally got arrested. Read on to find out why:) because they are guaranteed food, a bed, medical treatment, and a regular schedule.

As a teenager, Michael joined a gang and fell out of touch with his dad—then he was convicted of murder and sent to prison himself. For almost 20 years, Michael and Kenneth have been incarcerated at Stateville Correctional Center, both serving life sentences. Prison officials would not allow the Keys to be interviewed together, but in separate phone conversations, father and son talked to The Marshall Project about rekindling their relationship behind bars. At the time, they were living in cells next to one another. Their interviews have been edited for length and clarity.).
1.2.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: A crime wave among older people in Japan was sparked by several pensioners who [opted to go to jail](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-47033704)(I ask him if he likes being in prison, and he points out an additional financial upside - his pension continues to be paid even while he's inside.\n\n"It's not that I like it but I can stay there for free," he says. "And when I get out I have saved some money. So it is not that painful."\n\nToshio represents a striking trend in Japanese crime. In a remarkably law-abiding society, a rapidly growing proportion of crimes is carried about by over-65s. In 1997 this age group accounted for about one in 20 convictions but 20 years later the figure had grown to more than one in five - a rate that far outstrips the growth of the over-65s as a proportion of the population \(though they now make up more than a quarter of the total\).) to avoid spending money.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1.3. Con: The issue of people deliberately being arrested in order to access medical services may be unique to the United States because of the lack of public healthcare and [mental health services](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/mental-health-care-severely-inequitable-came-coronavirus-crisis/)(People with mental health disabilities, like other historically oppressed communities, are experiencing compounded harms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because sanism—oppression that has systematically disadvantaged people perceived or determined to be mentally ill—pervades public policy and life in the United States. People with mental health disabilities face disproportionately high rates of poverty, housing and employment discrimination, and criminalization. The economic and social upheaval caused by the coronavirus outbreak has merely exacerbated these disparities for those who were disabled prior to the crisis, while also exposing scores more people to individual and communal trauma, loss, and uncertainty.).
1.2.1.4.1.3.2. Con: The desire to go to prison is a symptom of the [greater failure of society](https://www.businessinsider.com/jail-getting-arrested-deliberately-2018-3?r=US&IR=T#to-get-access-to-healthcare-2)(Unable to afford healthcare for a rare form of leukemia, the 56-year-old Morrocco walked into a Wegman's grocery store, stepped up to the counter, and took $23 worth of goods in plain sight of store employees before walking out.\n\nHe was eventually arrested on a shoplifting charge — a violation of his supervised release that Morrocco said he hoped would land him back in prison.\n\n"It was an act of desperation. I went into that store and took things I didn’t need, and I made sure a lot of people saw me," Morrocco told The Buffalo News. "At the time I did it, I felt that I didn’t have any other way to get the care that I need for my leukemia.") to provide opportunities for the disadvantaged.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: People commit crimes in prison.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: Nearly half of the people imprisoned in Western Australia [committed additional crimes](https://theconversation.com/the-inside-story-on-crime-within-prison-114075)(Of the sample studied, 55% had no prison offences recorded across the study period. But for some, imprisonment is an opportunity to continue their offending ways. A number of those studied occasionally engaged in acts that disrupted the good order, government or security of the prison. Others routinely and consistently violated prison rules.) while they were locked up.
1.2.1.4.2.2. Con: Society at large is still protected from criminals behind bars, even if they commit crimes inside prison.
1.2.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Prison gangs not only control prisons themselves but also organize [criminal activities](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/how-gangs-took-over-prisons/379330/)(Originally formed for self-protection, prison gangs have become the unlikely custodians of order behind bars—and of crime on the streets.) in broader society.
1.2.1.4.2.2.2. Con: Criminals are still members of society, whether or not they are actively participating in free society. Therefore, criminal activity still affects an aspect of society.
1.2.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: An [out of sight, out of mind](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/out-of-sight-out-of-mind)(said to emphasize that when something or someone cannot be seen, it is easy to forget it, him, or her) mentality protects free society from harm while prisoners are locked up.
1.2.1.4.2.3. Pro: Some in-prison crimes include [attacks on correctional officers](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/02/20/mississippi-prisons-no-one-s-safe-not-even-the-guards)(Prisoners have attacked guards more than 340 times a year, on average, since 2016, according to our analysis; there were an average of 1,300 guards on the job each year. They were beaten, stabbed with makeshift knives, sexually assaulted and often “dashed”—prison slang for being doused with urine, feces or hot water—according to state records and interviews. The state acknowledged that about 115 of these assaults each year caused serious injuries.\n\nInmates, officers and experts agree about the principal cause of the violence: Mississippi prisons are so short staffed that nobody there is safe.), who are members of society at large.
1.2.1.4.2.4. Con: Individuals committing crimes in prison defeats the entire purpose of having prisons in the first place.
1.2.1.4.2.5. Pro: Many prisons are hotbeds of abuse and [criminal activity](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/aug/4/crime-statistics-texas-prison-system-unchanged/)(The crime rate in Texas prisons has remained about the same despite a decrease in prisoner population of about 9,000 over the past ten years.\n\nSince 2009, 3,001 Texas prisoners and 584 Texas prison guards have been charged with crimes that occurred within the prison system. The most charges were filed against prisoners in 2012 with 683 charges. The peak for guards was 154 in 2009.\n\nTexas has the largest prison system in the country with around 151,000 prisoners incarcerated in 109 prisons. In 2013, 93 guards were charged while in the first four months of 2014, 87 prisoners faced charges. The charges are, often related to contraband smuggling, but can range into theft, assault, rape or even murder.). Putting people in them is an inhumane punishment.
1.2.1.4.2.5.1. Pro: [Sexual assault is very common](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/us-more-men-raped-than-women)(Those numbers are not quite correct, but they are nonetheless horrifying. First of all, "sexual assault" is not always the same as "rape" and includes a variety of behaviour that wouldn't meet the legal standard for rape. So it's not clear that there are actually more rapes of men than women, or more rapes of prisoners than non-prisoners. Also, the number I found through the Department of Justice \(DOJ\) was 88,500 victims of sexual victimisation. This New York Review of Books article says that the DOJ revised those findings, getting to 216,000.) in many prison environments.
1.2.1.4.2.5.2. Pro: With all the idle time spent in prison, prisoner's minds tend to wander into the territory of illicit behaviors \([p. 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332980755_Idleness_and_Inmate_Misconduct_A_New_Perspective_on_Time_Use_and_Behavior_in_Local_Jails)(Theory and extant research suggest that engagement in structured and prosocial activities promotes positive behavioral and emotional outcomes, while idleness has a negative impact on inmate behavior and well-being. However, the literature that examines these relationships is largely based on qualitative methodology, small samples, and prison population. Using data from the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, this study fills the gap in the literature by examining the associations between engagement in various activities in jail and inmate misconduct. This study also explores individual and jail-level factors that predict inmate engagement in different activities in jails. The results show that watching TV and working in jail are associated with lower misconduct, whereas recreation and reading are associated with higher levels of several types of misconduct. The data also reveal that certain personal and institution-level factors predict the extent of engagement in formal and leisure)\).
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: State prison deaths from unnatural causes have been [steadily increasing](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/06/08/prison_mortality/)(In 2018, state prisons reported 4,135 deaths \(not including the 25 people executed in state prisons\); this is the highest number on record since BJS began collecting mortality data in 2001. Between 2016 and 2018, the prison mortality rate jumped from 303 to a record 344 per 100,000 people, a shameful superlative. It may seem like a foregone conclusion that more people, serving decades or lifetimes, will die in prison. But for at least 935 people, a sentence for a nonviolent property, drug, or public order offense became a death sentence in 2018.) in recent years.
1.2.1.5. Con: Having caused harm themselves, prisoners have placed themselves outside of the normal protections of society, including protection from harm by way of punishment.
1.2.1.6. Pro: Given that some people are [wrongly convicted](https://innocenceproject.org/research-resources/)(As of January 2020, the Innocence Project has documented over 375 DNA exonerations in the United States. Twenty-one of these exonerees had previously been sentenced to death.\n\nThe vast majority \(97%\) of these people were wrongfully convicted of committing sexual assault and/or murder. Although these individuals were innocent of these crimes, approximately 25% had confessed and 11% had pleaded guilty. These exonerees spent an average of 14 years in prison–10% of whom spent 25 years or more in prison for crimes they didn’t commit.) and that many criminal justice systems [disproportionally incarcerate minorities](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/)(Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons across the country at nearly five times the rate of whites, and Latinx people are 1.3 times as likely to be incarcerated than non-Latinx whites. This report documents the rates of incarceration for white, Black and Latinx Americans in each state, identifies three contributors to racial and ethnic disparities in imprisonment, and provides recommendations for reform.), a focus on rehabilitation would provide much less harm to those unfairly imprisoned.
1.2.1.7. Con: Rehabilitation is more invasive by its very nature as it aims to improve the prisoner's life and reduce recidivism permanently.
1.2.2. Pro: Prominent philosophers and schools of thought have promoted the idea of rehabilitation.
1.2.2.1. Con: Society should treat criminals as people with [free will](https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will)(free will, in philosophy and science, the supposed power or capacity of humans to make decisions or perform actions independently of any prior event or state of the universe. Arguments for free will have been based on the subjective experience of freedom, on sentiments of guilt, on revealed religion, and on the common assumption of individual moral responsibility that underlies the concepts of law, reward, punishment, and incentive. In theology, the existence of free will must be reconciled with God’s omniscience and benevolence and with divine grace, which allegedly is necessary for any meritorious act. A prominent feature of existentialism is the concept of a radical, perpetual, and frequently agonizing freedom of choice. Jean-Paul Sartre \(1905–80\), for example, spoke of the individual “condemned to be free.”) who choose to commit crimes. This perspective justifies punishment as an appropriate response to criminality.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Society disregarding free will is highly unethical, resulting in an approach that seeks to purge criminal impulses by reprogramming an unwilling subject's mind.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: If a prisoner were forced to undergo rehabilitation, that would amount to an unethical reprogramming of their mind. But rehabilitation could be an option for prisoners, and those who opt out of such programs could still be punished.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Forced rehabilitation is a violation of an individual's human rights \([p. 33](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin-Martinez-Velasco/publication/359802956_EFFECTS_OF_EMOTIONAL_AND_UTILITARIAN_APPEALS_ON_ATTITUDE_CHANGE_TOWARDS_FORCED_REHABILITATION_FOR_DRUG_ABUSE/links/624f5871cf60536e2349ca1e/EFFECTS-OF-EMOTIONAL-AND-UTILITARIAN-APPEALS-ON-ATTITUDE-CHANGE-TOWARDS-FORCED-REHABILITATION-FOR-DRUG-ABUSE.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(Therefore, human rights advocacy organizations and HR defense public agencies should be able to benefit from this knowledge by designing advocacy campaigns that deploy emotional or utilitarian appeals to dissuade citizens, including public officers, from supporting FR. Further, I believe that reducing the public’s support towards FR could eventually result in reduced demand for treatment at annexes, while increasing demand for private and public treatment options with higher standards of care. If this was the case, even annexes would be incentivized to improve their services and to start to respect the autonomy of the individuals they service.)\).
1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Forced rehabilitation has been condemned by a number of UN entities \([p. 1](https://idhdp.com/media/1236/idpc-advocacy-note_compulsory-rehabilitation-latin-america_english.pdf)(Today despite a recent call by various United Nations \(UN\) bodies to immediately stop all forms of compulsory drug detention centres, several countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, Uruguay and Mexico, use some form of compulsory rehabilitation or are considering adopting such an approach.)\).
1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Forced rehabilitation and rehabilitative prisons are not the same concepts.
1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: Effective punishment, much like rehabilitation, is designed to reprogram an unwilling subject's mind to purge criminal impulses.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Some philosophers [have argued](https://theconversation.com/do-criminals-freely-decide-to-commit-offences-how-the-courts-decide-133751)(Some philosophers and scientists argue no-one has free will and no-one is ever responsible for any crime, no matter how serious. They suggest the impact of genes and formative social environments on us mean there’s no room left for free will.) that criminals do not have a choice and that no one should be held responsible for the crimes they commit.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Most philosophers, as well as the criminal justice system, [believe humans have agency](https://theconversation.com/do-criminals-freely-decide-to-commit-offences-how-the-courts-decide-133751)(This radical view, however, is not held by the majority of philosophers working on free will, nor is it held by the courts.\n\nThe criminal justice system presupposes people generally are free to decide whether or not to engage in criminal behaviour. If they do choose to commit a crime, it is presumed that they are responsible for what they’ve done.) when committing crimes.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: Criminals can exercise free will by voluntarily [choosing rehabilitation](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-the-pandemic-led-to-the-rise-of-virtual-rehab)(An estimated 20 million people over age 12 in the United States have a substance use disorder, according to a 2019 survey from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 4.2 million people get help in a given year.\n\n“Teletherapy, telehealth, and other methods of providing addiction treatment via virtual means have been very successful, and much of the efficacy of this method was highlighted during the pandemic,” explained Dr. Lawrence Weinstein, chief medical officer at American Addiction Centers.), an option that should be widely available.
1.2.2.2. Con: The [theory of utilitarianism](https://iep.utm.edu/punishme/#SH1a)(Utilitarianism is the moral theory that holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the balance of good over evil that is produced by that action.\n\n\[...\]\n\nWhen attempting to determine whether a punishment is justifiable, utilitarians will attempt to anticipate the likely consequences of carrying out the punishment. If punishing an offender would most likely produce the greatest balance of happiness over unhappiness compared with the other available options \(not taking any action, publicly denouncing the offender, etc.\), then the punishment is justified. If another available option would produce a greater balance of happiness over unhappiness, then that option should be chosen and punishment is unjustified.) can be interpreted to support punishment.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Utilitarians are most concerned with reducing crime levels in order to increase happiness in society. As such, many utilitarians consider punishment to be an [effective deterrent](https://iep.utm.edu/punishme/#SH1a)(Clearly, crimes tend to produce unhappiness, so in seeking to promote a state of affairs in which the balance of happiness over unhappiness is maximized, a utilitarian will be highly concerned with reducing crime. Traditionally, utilitarians have focused on three ways in which punishment can reduce crime. First, the threat of punishment can deter potential offenders. If an individual is tempted to commit a certain crime, but he knows that it is against the law and a punishment is attached to a conviction for breaking that law, then, generally speaking, that potential offender will be less likely to commit the crime. Second, punishment can incapacitate offenders. If an offender is confined for a certain period of time, then that offender will be less able to harm others during that period of time. Third, punishment can rehabilitate offenders. Rehabilitation involves making strides to improve an offender’s character so that he will be less likely to re-offend.) to crime.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Utilitarianism can also encompass some aspects of rehabilitation insofar as it ensures released criminals [do not inflict further harm](https://law.jrank.org/pages/9576/Punishment-THEORIES-PUNISHMENT.html)(Rehabilitation is another utilitarian rationale for punishment. The goal of rehabilitation is to prevent future crime by giving offenders the ability to succeed within the confines of the law. Rehabilitative measures for criminal offenders usually include treatment for afflictions such as mental illness, chemical dependency, and chronic violent behavior. Rehabilitation also includes the use of educational programs that give offenders the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the job market.).
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: [Cesare Beccaria](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cesare-Beccaria)(Cesare Beccaria, in full Cesare Bonesana, marchese \(marquess\) di Beccaria, \(born March 15, 1738, Milan \[Italy\]—died November 28, 1794, Milan\), Italian criminologist and economist whose Dei delitti e delle pene \(1764; Eng. trans. J.A. Farrer, Crimes and Punishment, 1880\) was a celebrated volume on the reform of criminal justice.) argued that while punishment should not be gratuitous, the certainty of retribution for criminal acts would deter criminals \([p. 234](https://marisluste.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/deterrence-theory.pdf)(If the sole purpose of punishment is to prevent crime in society, Beccaria \(1963\) argued, “punishments are unjust when their severity exceeds what is necessary to achieve deterrence” \(p. 14\). Excessive severity will not reduce crime, in other words, it will only increase crime. In Beccaria’s view, swift and certain punishment are the best means of preventing and controlling crime; punishment for any other reason is capricious, superfluous, and repressive.)\).
1.2.2.3. Con: Moral relativism holds that [morality is relative and contested](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/)(The term ‘moral relativism’ is understood in a variety of ways. Most often it is associated with an empirical thesis that there are deep and widespread moral disagreements and a metaethical thesis that the truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute, but relative to the moral standard of some person or group of persons. Sometimes ‘moral relativism’ is connected with a normative position about how we ought to think about or act towards those with whom we morally disagree, most commonly that we should tolerate them.). Therefore, rehabilitation is inappropriate as it attempts to convert others to the authority's own, relative, position.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Bringing moral relativism to its ultimate conclusion would [make it impossible for society to function](https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/)(In the eyes of many critics, though, the most serious objection to moral relativism is that it implies the pernicious consequence that “anything goes”: slavery is just according to the norms of a slave society; sexist practices are right according to the values of a sexist culture. Without some sort of non-relative standard to appeal to, the critics argue, we have no basis for critical moral appraisals of our own culture’s conventions, or for judging one society to be better than another.), as individuals could justify harming others from their subjective position.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: [Normative moral relativism](https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#SH2f)(Normative relativism is the view that it is wrong to judge or interfere with the moral beliefs and practices of cultures that operate with a different moral framework to one’s own, that what goes on in a society should only be judged by the norms of that society. It is a prescriptive position adopted initially by many anthropologists reacting against the ethnocentrism characteristic of the colonial era. Melvelle Herskovits, for instance, affirms that “… in practice, the philosophy of relativism is a philosophy of tolerance” \(Cultural Relativism, p. 31\). Similar claims can be found in the writings of Ruth Benedict and Edvard Westermarck.) holds that we ought to tolerate others even when we disagree with the morality of their behaviour.
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: [Meta-ethical moral relativism](https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#SH2e)(Meta-ethical relativism holds that moral judgments are not true or false in any absolute sense, but only relative to particular standpoints. This idea is essential to just about any version of moral relativism. Relativizing truth to standpoints is a way of answering in advance the objection that relativism implies that the same sentence can be both true and false. The relativity clause means that the same sentence—say, “slavery is unjust”—can be both true and false, but not in exactly the same sense, since the term “unjust” contains an implicit reference to some particular normative framework.) holds that nobody is objectively right or wrong when people disagree about morality.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Some schools of philosophy argue that no human being is born evil.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Thomas Hobbes argued that human beings are essentially machines that [ruthlessly pursue their own self-interest](https://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/hobbes/themes/)(Hobbes believed that all phenomena in the universe, without exception, can be explained in terms of the motions and interactions of material bodies. He did not believe in the soul, or in the mind as separate from the body, or in any of the other incorporeal and metaphysical entities in which other writers have believed. Instead, he saw human beings as essentially machines, with even their thoughts and emotions operating according to physical laws and chains of cause and effect, action and reaction. As machines, human beings pursue their own self-interest relentlessly, mechanically avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure.).
1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: Jean-Jacques Rousseau criticized Hobbes, noting that man would be good without the [corruption of greed and inequality](https://www.bbcearth.com/news/are-we-born-good-or-evil-naughty-or-nice)(Rousseau openly criticised him, arguing instead that man would be gentle and pure without the corruption of greed and inequality caused by the class system imposed by our society.).
1.2.2.4.2.

According to him, men are born amoral. Not that we do not know what is moral or immoral but that morality is a priori. When we were born, we are not yet immoral but this state of life is made by choice. We do not become immoral from birth but from the choices we make. He believed that man is an amoral creature and that morality is a posteriori.)\).
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Developmental psychology has demonstrated that babies hold some [inherent good](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/are-babies-born-good-165443013/)(The Yale Infant Cognition Center is particularly interested in one of the most exalted social functions: ethical judgments, and whether babies are hard-wired to make them. The lab’s initial study along these lines, published in 2007 in the journal Nature, startled the scientific world by showing that in a series of simple morality plays, 6- and 10-month-olds overwhelmingly preferred “good guys” to “bad guys.” “This capacity may serve as the foundation for moral thought and action,” the authors wrote. It “may form an essential basis for...more abstract concepts of right and wrong.”).

1.2.2.4.3.2. Pro: Babies as young as seven months are able to [pass moral judgements](https://www.bbcearth.com/news/are-we-born-good-or-evil-naughty-or-nice)(To do this, babies less than a year old were made to watch a puppet show where different coloured shapes acted in ways that were clearly recognisable as morally right or wrong. A red circle is shown struggling to climb a hill while an “evil” blue square tries to push it back down. Meanwhile, “good” yellow triangle attempts to help the red circle by pushing it up.\n\nAfter the play, the babies were asked which shape they wanted to play with: evil blue square or good yellow triangle. As you may have guessed, they all picked the latter, the triangle that exhibited ‘helpful’ and ‘selfless’ behaviour. This applied even for babies as young as seven months.).
1.2.2.4.3.3. Con: [Empathy develops with age](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120307132206.htm)(A new study suggests that age-associated improvements in the ability to consider the preferences of others are linked with maturation of a brain region involved in self control. The findings, published by Cell Press in the March 8 issue of the journal Neuron, may help to explain why young children often struggle to control selfish impulses, even when they know better, and could impact educational strategies designed to promote successful social behavior.\n\nHuman social interactions often involve two parties who want to maximize their own outcomes while reaching a mutually satisfactory result. It is generally accepted that over the course of childhood behavior shifts from a more selfish focus to an increased tendency to consider the benefits to others. However, little is known about age-related changes in this type of "strategic social behavior" or the underlying neuronal mechanisms.), suggesting that younger children lack this crucial life skill.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Kant's philosophy of [human dignity](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-handbook-of-human-dignity/kantian-perspectives-on-the-rational-basis-of-human-dignity/888A73505F167E52F149953CCFE74A20)(Kant's main themes were these \(Kant 2002: 214–45\): all persons, regardless of rank or social class, have an equal intrinsic worth or dignity. Human dignity is an innate worth or status that we did not earn and cannot forfeit. Rather, we must strive to make our individual choices worthy of this moral standing, which elevates us above animals and mere things. A fundamental principle of reason and morality, the Categorical Imperative, tells us to treat humanity in each person never merely as a means, but always as an end in itself. We must act as if we were both law-makers and subjects in an ideal moral commonwealth in which the members, as ends in themselves, have dignity rather than mere price. In contrast to market price and other values that are dependent on our personal attachments, Kant calls dignity ‘an unconditional and incomparable worth’ that ‘admits of no equivalent’.) can be interpreted as supporting rehabilitation.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Kant is generally regarded as a proponent of a retributive theory of punishment \([p. 169](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188084754.pdf)(in the history of retributivism, Kant has a prominent place. He was one of the classic defenders of a tough retributivism, at a time when the new humaneness and teleology in the theory of punishment was making its first headway with the help of \(equally classic\) Enlightenment writers like Beccaria.)\).
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: Kant suggests that it is the [intention](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#GooWilMorWorDut)(The basic idea, as Kant describes it in the Groundwork, is that what makes a good person good is his possession of a will that is in a certain way “determined” by, or makes its decisions on the basis of, whatever basic moral principles there may be. The idea of a good will is supposed to be the idea of one who is committed only to make decisions that she holds to be morally worthy and who takes moral considerations in themselves to be conclusive reasons for guiding her behavior. This sort of disposition or character is something we all highly value, Kant thought. He believes we value it without limitation or qualification.) rather than the outcome \(or the potential for outcome\) that makes an action good.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Pro: An action being good based on the [intention](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/375997-grundlegung-zur-metaphysik-der-sitten)(A good will is good not because of what it effects, or accomplishes, not because of its fitness to attain some intended end, but good just by its willing, i.e. in itself; and, considered by itself, it is to be esteemed beyond compare much higher than anything that could ever be brought about by it in favor of some inclinations, and indeed, if you will, the sum of all inclinations. Even if by some particular disfavor of fate, or by the scanty endowment of a stepmotherly nature, this will should entirely lack the capacity to carry through its purpose; if despite its greatest striving it should still accomplish nothing, and only the good will were to remain \(not of course, as a mere wish, but as the summoning of all means that are within our control\); then, like a jewel, it would still shine by itself, as something that has full worth in itself.) means that people who have performed evil actions can be redeemed if they henceforth aim to do good.
1.2.2.5.2.2. Con: Kant's notion of "[good will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#GooWilMorWorDut)(In Kant’s terms, a good will is a will whose decisions are wholly determined by moral demands or, as he often refers to this, by the Moral Law. Human beings inevitably feel this Law as a constraint on their natural desires, which is why such Laws, as applied to human beings, are imperatives and duties. A human will in which the Moral Law is decisive is motivated by the thought of duty. A holy or divine will, if it exists, though good, would not be good because it is motivated by thoughts of duty because such a will does not have natural inclinations and so necessarily fulfills moral requirements without feeling constrained to do so. It is the presence of desires that could operate independently of moral demands that makes goodness in human beings a constraint, an essential element of the idea of “duty.”)" does not mean being nice towards others, rather that moral judgments are made out of recognition of one's duty. This stance is inherently neutral regarding the question of rehabilitation or punishment.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: Punishing others for personal gratification violates Kant's [philosophy of human dignity](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/)(What we can control, however, is the will behind the action. That is, we can will to act according to one law rather than another. The morality of an action, therefore, must be assessed in terms of the motivation behind it. If two people, Smith and Jones, perform the same act, from the same conception of the law, but events beyond Smith’s control prevent her from achieving her goal, Smith is not less praiseworthy for not succeeding. We must consider them on equal moral ground in terms of the will behind their actions.\n\nThe only thing that is good without qualification is the good will, Kant says.) as it is a type of sadism that does not come from good will.
1.2.2.6. Con: Violations of [social contract theory](https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/)(Social contract theory, nearly as old as philosophy itself, is the view that persons’ moral and/or political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live.), the tacit agreement whereby everyone agrees to live by the same set of rules, currently result in imprisonment as a punishment.

1.2.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Political fear of soft sentencing in the UK has [increased the average sentence length](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25657204)(It is popularly believed that - back in the days when the world was black and white - Britain's prisons were packed with criminals, and that since then the country has gone soft.\n\nWell, in 1945 there were roughly 15,000 people in jail. Today, the figure stands at 83,000 - and that huge leap isn't because we stopped sending people to the gallows.\n\nThe prison population has climbed because both Labour and Conservative governments have introduced laws that have led, incrementally, to more people being jailed - and more of them for longer.\n\nThere are inevitably fluctuations, but broadly speaking the prison population has doubled since 1993 thanks to Parliament telling judges to hand out longer jail sentences.) in recent decades. This suggests that the soft sentences themselves are not undermining the criminal justice system, but rather ill-judged reactions to them.

The military’s constitutional insulation from civilian oversight and control, the failure thus far to hold them accountable for human rights abuses and international crimes, and even periodic cheerleading from the international community for a “democratic transition” emboldened the military into thinking that subverting the will of the people could be done without major consequence.

Stages 3 and 4 fall under Level II, and Stages 5 and 6 fall under Level III.\n\n\[...\]\n\nMost important to criminal justice and criminology is the notion that laws are valid only if they are based on or grounded in justice. It is important to recognize that justice is subjective. Thus, Kohlberg argued that the quest for justice would ultimately call for disobeying unjust laws.

Yet this phrase is found three times in the Old Testament and is quoted by Jesus in the New Testament. Many people wonder if “eye for eye” was used literally in carrying out biblical judgments. Both Jewish and Christian scholars believe that “eye for eye” was used by judges to create proportionate penalties for harm caused to other people or animals, and that people were not maimed in the application of this law.)."
1.2.3.1.1.

Muslim schools of law have disagreed on whether three other crimes should be included as well: public apostasy \(ridda\), sodomy \(liwāṭ\) and assassination/premeditated murder for purposes of robbery \(ghīla\).\n\nWhat is in common among the hudud crimes is that their punishments are specified in the Qur'an or Sunna and that they are considered to be violations of the rights of God.9 Of course, some of the hudud are also violations of the rights of humans as well. Sariqa \(the hudud-level of theft, see below\), qadhf \(sexual slander\) and ḥirāba \(armed robbery, banditry\) are obviously violations of people’s rights to life, property and/or dignity.) and can involve punishments ranging from amputation to public stoning, depending on the crime.

Con: Modern justice systems are increasingly secular \([p. 3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1051071)(The fundamental changes that have taken place in our legal institutions during the past two generations are part of a transformation of the entire Western legal tradition, marked particularly by its disconnection from the religious foundations upon which it was built. For over eight hundred years, from the late eleventh to the early twentieth century, law in the West was supported by, and in many respects based on, religious beliefs, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. In the twentieth century the intimate connection between the Western legal tradition and the Western religious tradition has been substantially broken.)\). Religion should not be used to justify laws, including those concerning punishment or rehabilitation.

However, Joanna’s experiences have highlighted that volunteering within prisons is not simplistic; it is challenging, emotive, and constantly changing. Regardless of what religion an individual follows, faith-based intervention can play a vital part in the lives of those in prison or post release \(see Robinson-Edwards and Pinkney 2018\). In some cases, prisoners may not be particularly religious; however, the support received from Joanna and other volunteers in prison can be vital. Joanna illustrated the impact volunteering in prisons had on her personally; however, the overarching factor was Joanna’s experience of seeing the benefit of religiosity in prison.)\).

In early America, this meant dozens of people crammed in a room until some other punishment—often some type of public humiliation, bodily pain, mutilation or execution—could be inflicted. Enter the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons, a group of Christian, mostly Quaker, reformers. These idealists saw the continued use of corporal punishment as “proof of the feeble operation of reason and religion,” as the group’s founder, Benjamin Rush, wrote in 1787. They were not against punishments altogether. “I only wish only to change the place and manner of inflicting them so as to render them effectual for the reformation of criminals, and beneficial to society,” wrote Mr. Rush.) of justice, moral culpability, and free will.

Genes, via their influences on morphology and physiology, create a framework within which the environment acts to shape the behavior of an individual animal. The environment can affect morphological and physiological development; in turn behavior develops as a result of that animal’s shape and internal workings. Genes also create the scaffold for learning, memory, and cognition, remarkable mechanisms that allow animals to acquire and store information about their environment for use in shaping their behavior.).

1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.2.4.2. Con: Rehabilitation is still a form of punishment, resulting in victims obtaining some retribution.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Time spent away from family and friends, in an intensive treatment program with other inmates, until granted release by a licensed professional could be seen as both rehabilitative and punitive.

1.2.4.3.2. Con: Victims may prefer to receive meaningful compensation to appease their suffering rather than simply seeing the criminal punished.

We found that, in 2014 dollars, incarcerated people had a median annual income of $19,185 prior to their incarceration, which is 41% less than non-incarcerated people of similar ages.) than their peers at the time of their offense. Few prisoners can realistically afford to pay compensation to their victims.
1.2.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Compensation policies could even force the criminal to turn to theft to pay the debt owed to the original victim.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Pro: By paying their taxes, victims are indirectly paying to maintain offenders in prison.
1.2.4.3.2.3. Pro: Even non-economic crimes can have a [significant financial toll on the victim](https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/legal-and-political-magazines/statistics-costs-crime)(Estimating the costs of crime serves many purposes. At a very basic level, such estimates indicate the burden of crime for individuals and society. Victims often lose or have their property damaged. Replacing or repairing damaged goods, even in an era of widespread insurance, can result in substantial monetary loss. Victims also often sustain physical injury and suffer considerable psychological trauma. In seeking treatment or counseling, not to mention days lost from work, decreased productivity, and even long-term financial distress, victims of crime often experience a diminished quality of life and substantial financial burden. As the myriad consequences of crime are diverse and varied, estimates of monetary costs provide a common, easily interpretable measure for understanding the impact of crime on individuals and society.). Criminals should compensate victims for this.
1.2.4.3.2.3.1. Con: Victims are already rewarded through victim compensation schemes, which [reimburse the victim](https://www.rainn.org/articles/crime-victim-compensation)(Victim compensation is a direct financial reimbursement to a victim for an expense that resulted from a crime, such as medical costs or lost wages. Each state has a crime victim compensation program that allocates funds to survivors of sexual assault and other violent crimes.\n\[...\]\nFederal law requires that all state compensation programs cover the following crime-related costs:\n\n Lost wages or loss of support\n Medical costs\n Mental health counseling\n\nStates also cover other costs that relate directly to crimes of sexual violence, though the specifics of each program vary from state-to-state. Learn more about what costs may be covered in your state.) or their family for their expenses related to the crime.
1.2.4.3.2.4. Con: Some routes to compensation already exist in some jurisdictions alongside punishment for the offender.
1.2.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: Victims can seek compensation from criminals if they [sue them in a civil court](https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-the-difference-between-criminal-law-and-civil-law)(In criminal cases, for example, only the federal or a state government \(the prosecution\) may initiate a case; cases are almost always decided by a jury; punishment for serious \(felony\) charges often consists of imprisonment but may also include a fine paid to the government; to secure conviction, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the defendant "beyond a reasonable doubt"; and defendants are protected against conduct by police or prosecutors that violates their constitutional rights, \n\n\[...\]\n\nIn civil cases, by contrast, cases are initiated \(suits are filed\) by a private party \(the plaintiff\); cases are usually decided by a judge \(though significant cases may involve juries\); punishment almost always consists of a monetary award and never consists of imprisonment; to prevail, the plaintiff must establish the defendant's liability only according to the "preponderance of evidence"; and defendants are not entitled to the same legal protections as are the criminally accused.).
1.2.4.3.2.4.1.1.

1.2.4.3.2.5. Con: Allowing criminals to pay compensation instead of serving jail time would result in wealthy people buying their way out of consequences for their actions.
1.2.4.4. Con: The vast majority of crime is victimless.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: For violent crimes, surviving kin should be given some form of retribution for harms done.

1.2.4.4.4.

More states are beginning to decriminalize drug possession, treating drug offenses as a substance abuse problem rather than a crime. Categorizing drugs as medically useful or harmful is not always based on science. However, in some states, the victimless crime of marijuana possession can still lead to a prison sentence.).
1.2.4.4.4.1. Pro: [Jail is ineffective](https://www.peacevalleyrecovery.com/blog/rehab-vs-jail-time/)(Additionally, there are very few resources in terms of treatment within the jail and prison systems.

The BOP spends $110 million annually on drug treatment programs for approximately 80,000 inmates identified as dependent on narcotics. But for the 10,000 or so federal inmates dependent on heroin or other opioids, millions of those dollars are currently spent on outdated, ineffective approaches that wrongly prohibit medication-assisted therapies—approaches that, in other words,fail to help prisoners addicted to opioids during their sentence and ultimately return them afterwards to society as addicted as they were when they went into jail.).
1.2.4.4.4.1.1. Pro: Those in prison for drug-related crimes need rehabilitation.

With time, more and more alcohol or drugs are needed to achieve the same level of pleasure and satisfaction as when they first started.

This model still applies today.) of all drugs in the 1980s, allowing users to seek medical help without the fear of being arrested and prosecuted. The decline in the use of hard drugs demonstrates that an approach which prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment can be successful \([pp. 7, 12](https://pnsd.sanidad.gob.es/pnsd/estrategiaNacional/docs/ESTRATEGIA_ADICCIONES_2017-2024_en_ingles.pdf)(The trend in heroin use remains stable at very low levels.

1.2.4.4.4.1.2. Con: Illegal drugs should not be readily available in jails. Prison itself does not make drug problems worse, insufficient prevention of contraband smuggling does \([pp. 8-9](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/792125/prison-drugs-strategy.pdf)(The availability of drugs in our prisons is a threat to safety and security, obstructing recovery for prisoners with drug misuse issues and leading others to develop issues while in prison. Drugs enter prison in a variety of ways, including coming through the front gate, being thrown over the perimeter, through visits and post, and deliveries by drones. Many instances are arranged using illicit mobile phones, particularly as phones have become smaller and harder to detect using traditional scanning tools. To tackle this, we are continually improving all of the barriers to drug supply, including technology, processes and physical defences to minimise the opportunities for drugs to be conveyed. Often drug smuggling into prisons forms part of a complex illicit economy, driven in part by sophisticated and organised criminals. Therefore, identifying and disrupting those at the centre of this organised crime is crucial, as well finding any drugs that do enter our prisons.)\).
1.2.4.4.4.1.2.1. Con: Sufficient prevention of contraband smuggling may well not be possible, as long as nothing is done to decrease demand for drugs. If this is the case, then it can be said that punitive prison itself makes drug problems worse, as the presence of contraband smuggling is inseparable from it.
1.2.4.4.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: If people in prison want drugs, and can compensate someone for providing them, then prisoners will be motivated to find ways of smuggling drugs in. Preventing them would require implementing a security system with no vulnerabilities whatsoever.
1.2.4.4.4.1.3. Con: The tightly controlled sense of [order and routine](https://herrenwellness.com/the-importance-of-structure-and-routine-in-recovery/)(Routines and patterns also strengthen and enhance your recovery, as it helps you prioritize recovery, shore up healthier habits, reduce unpredictability \(which can be precarious in early recovery\), and provides you with a healthier, more balanced life.\n\nThe Benefits of Routine for Recovery\n\nRoutine helps you establish a predictable rhythm to your days. This is important as the body and mind learn to expect a certain pattern of behavior and adjust accordingly. Think of it as a “body clock” that becomes accustomed to your patterns.

Yet they were able to stop using heroin easily \(95% quit cold-turkey after months of heavy use\) when the war was over. They went back to the states and re-entered their well-connected lives and simply quit. No withdrawals, no cravings.), suggesting that prisoners with access to narcotics could end up with a stronger addiction than when they went to prison.
1.2.4.4.4.2.

The source country varies depending on the drug in question. For heroin the largest supplier is Afghanistan, and for cocaine it is Columbia. The researchers assume that the entire market is organised. Although there are some exceptions – for example some cannabis is grown and consumed by the same person – these instances make little difference to the total organised crime market size.)\).

1.2.4.5.1.3. Con: Causing extreme suffering, such as through torture, is [condemned by most societies and nearly all human rights treaties](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/torture/)(Under international law, torture and other forms of ill-treatment are always illegal. They have been outlawed internationally for decades. To take just a couple of examples, 172 countries have adhered to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and 165 countries are parties to the UN Convention against Torture which Amnesty International campaigned hard to create.).

1.2.4.6. Pro: Punishment should be equal to or greater than a reasonable equivalent of what the victim lost.
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: Most Americans believe that the death penalty is [morally justifiable](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/02/most-americans-favor-the-death-penalty-despite-concerns-about-its-administration/)(Yet support for the death penalty is strongly associated with a belief that when someone commits murder, the death penalty is morally justified.

1.2.4.6.2. Con: Punishment does not repair or undo the damage caused by criminal acts, while rehabilitation can involve some reconciliation between the criminal and the victim.
1.2.4.6.2.1. Con: Similarly, rehabilitation does not undo harms caused to victims.
1.2.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Since neither punishment nor rehabilitation undoes the harm caused to past victims, they should not be the focus of the justice system. Instead, preventing future crimes should be the primary justification for criminal justice policies.
1.2.4.6.2.2.

1.2.4.6.2.3. Con: While punishment does not repair prior damage, it could prevent future damage from occurring.
1.2.4.6.2.3.1. Con: Similarly, rehabilitation could prevent future harms from occurring.
1.2.4.7. Pro: Punishing criminals partially serves as a form of vengeance or retributive justice for the friends and families of their victims.
1.2.4.7.1. Pro: Lengthening prison sentences ensures that surviving victims and their families are protected from the criminal for a longer period of time.
1.2.4.7.1.1. Con: Effectively rehabilitating a criminal ensures that the victim is safe from the criminal, regardless of sentence length.
1.2.4.7.1.2. Pro: The knowledge that a dangerous criminal is safely locked up behind bars could allow some victims to rest peacefully at night.
1.2.4.7.1.2.1. Con: Some victims could be so traumatized from being attacked that they [lose sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/)(Kimi is a 35-year-old Native American woman who was group raped at the age of 16 on her walk home from a suburban high school.

Afterward, I couldn’t tolerate the fear that would arise when I walked in the neighborhood. It didn’t matter whether I was alone or with friends—every sound that I heard would throw me into a state of fear. I felt like the same thing was going to happen again.

1.2.4.7.1.2.2.

1.2.4.7.1.3. Con: Rehabilitative prison sentences are not necessarily shorter prison sentences.
1.2.4.7.2. Con: Basing sentencing guidelines on making the victim feel better could result in criminals with more forgiving victims serving significantly less time for the same crime.
1.2.4.7.3. Pro: Harsh prison sentences may satisfy crime victims' desire for revenge in the short term \([p. 62](https://uorth.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/orth_2004_ab.pdf)(Criminal victimization often provokes strong feelings of revenge. Two studies were conducted to investigate whether legal punishment of the perpetrator reduces victims’ feelings of revenge. A cross-sectional study of 174 crime victims revealed that punishment severity does not predict feelings of revenge at a time several years after the trial. A longitudinal study of 31 crime victims revealed that, for the time interval from a few weeks before the trial to a few weeks after the trial, punishment severity significantly predicts a decrease in feelings of revenge; nevertheless intraindividual and interindividual stability of these feelings was high.)\).
1.2.4.7.4. Pro: Some people may prefer perpetrators to serve [perpetual prison sentences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml)(Some people who believe in the notion of retribution are against capital punishment because they feel the death penalty provides insufficient retribution. They argue that life imprisonment without possibility of parole causes much more suffering to the offender than a painless death after a short period of imprisonment.) rather than receive the death penalty because this would cause the criminal greater suffering.
1.2.4.7.4.1. Con: Some research suggests that the victim is satisfied if the offender recognizes why the punishment was imposed upon them rather than if they see the offender being punished \([p. 2](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00677624/document)(Participants showed higher levels of implicit goal fulfillment if they decided to take revenge and if the offender signaled understanding for the vengeful response.

1.2.4.7.4.2. Pro: Some victims and their families believe that the death penalty would cause them additional harm and suffering, including one woman who pleaded for a [stay of execution](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/dear-governor-please-dont-execute-kennth-williams)(Dear Governor Hutchinson,\n\nMy name is Kayla Greenwood.

1.2.4.7.4.2.1. Pro: If someone is the victim of a violent crime, [perpetuating the violence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/evolution-the-self/201401/five-biggest-problems-revenge-and-its-best-remedies)(Wreaking Revenge on Another Is Either Corrupt or Corrupting.\n\nIt degrades the one pursuing revenge. Fighting evil with commensurate evil \(i.e., “an eye for an eye”—or worse\) certainly doesn’t engender virtue in the avenger; it seriously undermines it.

So, as many writers have pointedly expressed:\n\n"Funny thing about revenge. It could make a killer out of a nun." — Kevis Hendrickson\n\n"Vengeance, retaliation, retribution, revenge are deceitful brothers; vile, beguiling demons promising justifiable compensation to a pained soul for his losses.

Instead of sanctioning violent revenge, society should rehabilitate both the criminal and the victim.
1.2.4.7.5. Con: Retribution may lead to spiraling cycles of violence.
1.2.4.7.5.1. Con: The state punishing a criminal in prison is unlikely to lead to retributive violence against the criminal's victim and their family.
1.2.4.7.5.2. Pro: Retribution can lead to spirals of violence as in the infamous [feud](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hatfields-and-McCoys)(The origins of the feud are obscure. Some attribute it to hostilities formed during the American Civil War, in which the McCoys were Unionists and the Hatfields were Confederates, others to Rand’l McCoy’s belief that a Hatfield stole one of his hogs in 1878. However, although animosities had built up and occasional fights had broken out, the first major bloodletting did not occur until 1882, when Ellison Hatfield was mortally shot in a brawl with McCoys and, in revenge, the Hatfields kidnapped and executed three McCoy brothers—Tolbert, Phamer, and Randolph, Jr.\n\nThese murders sharpened the backwoods warfare, and thereafter Hatfields and McCoys repeatedly ambushed and killed one another.) between the Hatfields and McCoys.
1.2.4.7.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.7.4.2.
1.2.4.8. Con: Focusing on rehabilitation does not remove the victim's rights; rather, it can benefit the victim while respecting the criminal's rights.
1.2.4.8.1. Pro: By a two to one margin, most victims of crime would prefer that the criminal justice system focus on rehabilitation, not punishment \([p. 1](https://allianceforsafetyandjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/documents/Crime%20Survivors%20Speak%20Press%20Release.pdf)(A new, first-of-its-kind national survey released by the Alliance for Safety and Justice \(ASJ\) bucks conventional wisdom regarding the views of crime victims on incarceration.

1.2.4.8.1.1. Pro: [Rehabilitation schemes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-criminals-and-victims-meet-both-parties-can-benefit/)(Victims who participate in such discussions with a perpetrator report feeling they can forgive their attacker, and offenders say they feel responsibility for their actions—a change in trajectory for both parties. Two recent randomized controlled studies add to mounting evidence for the effectiveness of these restorative practices.) that encourage offenders and victims to meet can help victims forgive their attacker and encourage criminals to take responsibility for their crimes.
1.2.4.8.1.2. Con: Most of the general public is [uninterested](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12814504/mass-incarceration-poll)(A new poll by Morning Consult and Vox gives some insight: Americans agree there are too many people in prison — but they’re only willing to cut sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, not violent criminals.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe findings suggest that Americans are willing to cut back on some incarceration — just not the level that reformers have put forward with #Cut50, the bipartisan goal to reduce the overall prison population by 50 percent over the next 10 years. This has huge implications for policy: If US politicians move to dethrone the US as the world’s leader in incarceration \(with only the small African nation of Seychelles boasting a higher imprisonment rate\), they could face very stiff opposition from the public.) in reforming the criminal justice system.
1.2.4.8.1.3. Pro: Many people in countries with punishment as a primary focus have [lost their faith](https://iaals.du.edu/blog/trusting-public-s-perception-our-justice-system)(For one, there are some people \(read: me\) that don’t accept as a win that 30 percent of the voting population does not have confidence in state court systems. Second, it’s hard to even accept that particular statistic because, as a blanket figure, that isn’t the whole picture. Many studies have found substantial differences in how people from different racial and ethnic groups answer the question of whether they have confidence in their state courts. In fact, the 2015 version of the same survey found a “massive racial gap on most measures, with African Americans much more distrustful of the courts and the broader justice system.” That survey found that only 32 percent of surveyed Black Americans believe state courts provide equal justice to all. This is consistent with other studies showing findings of low levels of trust and confidence among Black and minority respondents.) in the justice system.
1.2.4.8.2. Pro: The offender's rights should not be considered subordinate to the victim's desire for revenge. As such, legal systems should not promote a victim's right to retribution.
1.2.4.8.2.1. Con: Many proposals have been introduced to focus on a victim's [right to retribution](https://www.independent.org/publications/policy_reports/detail.asp?id=9243)(In order to provide structure for discussing victims’ rights, considering where the current problems lie and what long-term solutions are needed, I will first introduce the major systematic reform that I propose: namely, reorienting the criminal justice system to a theory of punishment called punitive restitution. I will define punitive restitution and give some of the history of one of its major components, offender restitution.\n\nThen I will treat a wide array of victims’ rights issues and issues of implementation of punitive restitution.\n\n\[...\]\n\nNonetheless, at other times—in particular in times of state-building—public officials have charged criminals with crimes “against the king’s peace” or crimes “against the state,” instead of crimes against specific individuals. Officials have substituted self-serving penalties for restitutive penalties that repaired the injury done to the victim.), as has been the case historically.
1.2.4.8.2.2. Con: Japan has a [legal system](https://www.independent.org/publications/policy_reports/detail.asp?id=9243)(Although Japan has a unique culture, the features of Japanese culture that encourage the success of restitution \(an emphasis on acknowledging guilt, repenting, and seeking absolution\) are present in the Judeo-Christian tradition and in other cultural and ethical-religious traditions found in the United States.\n\n\[...\]\n\nJohn Owen Haley, an academic specialist on Japanese law, describes the underlying theme of postwar Japan’s criminal justice system as follows: “A pattern of confession, repentance, and absolution dominates each stage of law enforcement in Japan.” The overwhelming majority of persons accused of criminal offenses admit their guilt, show repentance, seek and bargain for a pardon from their victims, and ask for mercy from the civic authorities. In response, the self-confessed offenders receive punishment that is lenient as compared to penalties in other industrial countries.) which is deliberately and narrowly focused on retribution.
1.2.4.8.2.3. Pro: Human rights are [universal](https://www.ohchr.org/en/what-are-human-rights)(The principle of universality of human rights is the cornerstone of international human rights law. This means that we are all equally entitled to our human rights. This principle, as first emphasized in the UDHR, is repeated in many international human rights conventions, declarations, and resolutions.\n\nHuman rights are inalienable. They should not be taken away, except in specific situations and according to due process. For example, the right to liberty may be restricted if a person is found guilty of a crime by a court of law.); the rights of one are not considered subordinate to the rights of others.
1.2.4.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.6.1.2.1.
1.2.5. Con: Prisons should not be rehabilitation centres as the healthcare system is better equipped to rehabilitate people.
1.2.5.1. Con: Most healthcare systems will need a great deal of reform before the detention and rehabilitation of potentially dangerous criminals in healthcare environments becomes feasible.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Beginning to use the healthcare system to rehabilitate dangerous criminals could be the impetus needed for proper reform.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Many healthcare systems are [already overloaded](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/07/26/overwhelmed-us-hospital-systems-a-look-into-the-future/)(A new study conducted via the U.S. Premier Healthcare Database revealed nearly one in every four Covid-19 deaths may be attributed to hospital strain related to case overload. The results exposed staggering mortality rates suggesting that, despite improvements in Covid-19 survival between March and August 2020, surges in hospital Covid-19 caseload remain detrimental to survival and potentially erode benefits gained from emerging treatments. The lack of preparation from hospitals experiencing high surges and even higher mortality rates is devastating and, furthermore, reveals an opportunity for the United States to take steps forward to prevent this from happening again.). The current healthcare system in many countries would be unable to handle the increased load if prisoners were rehabilitated in medical facilities.
1.2.5.1.3. Pro: Rehabilitation of criminals requires specialized skills and a secure environment, neither of which are usually provided in a hospital that has not been retrofitted explicitly for that purpose.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: In Nordic countries, prisons are [rehabilitation institutions](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48885846)(But in the early 1990s, the ethos of the Norwegian Correctional Service underwent a rigorous series of reforms to focus less on what Hoidal terms "revenge" and much more on rehabilitation. Prisoners, who had previously spent most of their day locked up, were offered daily training and educational programmes and the role of the prison guards was completely overhauled.).
1.2.5.1.3.2. Con: Rehabilitation skills can either be taught to current employees or new ones with these skills can be hired.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Hospitals have outpatient care, inpatient care, and long-term mental health providers, all of which should help prisoners be successfully rehabilitated.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Many prisoners do not have access to the healthcare system. If rehabilitation services were provided through this system, many criminals would be unable to access them.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Having health insurance or not in the developed world is [uniquely American](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/heres-a-map-of-the-countries-that-provide-universal-health-care-americas-still-not-on-it/259153/)(As excited as American liberals and proponents of expanding access to health care might be about the Supreme Court's decision to largely uphold the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. still stands out from much of the developed world in state efforts to make medical care available to the public.); in nearly every other developed country these inmates would be cared for the same as any other citizen.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: Even those in the US with government-sponsored Medicaid coverage [lose their benefits](https://www.healthcare.gov/incarcerated-people/)(Medicaid won’t pay for your medical care while you’re in prison or jail. But if you enroll in Medicaid while you’re incarcerated you may be able to get needed care more quickly after you’re released.) upon incarceration and would need to pay for their medical bills on their own.
1.2.5.2.1.3. Pro: In Illinois and San Fransisco, [80-90% of people jailed](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/health-coverage-and-care-for-the-adult-criminal-justice-involved-population/)(Overall, data on the income and insurance status of people moving into and out of the criminal justice system are limited. However, survey data from 2002 show that nearly six in ten jail inmates reported monthly income of less than $1,000 prior to their arrest. Data also suggest that the population is largely uninsured. For example, a survey of San Francisco county jails found that about 90% of people who enter county jails have no health insurance. Another survey of inmates returning to the community from Illinois jails found that more than eight in ten were uninsured after returning to the community at 16 months post-release.) did not have health insurance at the time of their arrest.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: Prisons often cause further damage to prisoners' mental health \([pp. 13-14](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/7455/documents/78054/default/)(Arrival in prison, whether for the first time or not, is a dangerous point for prisoners’ mental health with concomitant risks of self-harm and suicide. This area has seen improvements: for example, since 2018 the NHS contract has required healthcare providers to carry out first-day screening for all prisoners arriving in prison. The current NHS service specification also includes a follow-up assessment within seven days of arrival.\n\nKate Davies, Director for Health and Justice at NHS England, told us how important the first night and seven-day follow-up screening is:\n\n"It is quite often when men and women go back to their cell, they are in custody for the first time or they may be in custody on repeated occasions, that their drug misuse may well decline or change or become more chaotic. Their own anxieties, their own needs around medication and psychosis then come to the fore, so those two elements are absolutely essential.”)\), while treatment in a healthcare environment [usually improves mental health outcomes](https://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/2020/03/02/news/frankie-bridge-going-into-hospital-saved-my-life-1850847/)(The worst time, she recalls, was the build up to admitting herself to the Nightingale Hospital in London.\n\n"I just felt so out of control and lost. I had no idea what was going on. It was a really scary time."\n\nShe was in hospital for a month.\n\n"I believe going into hospital saved my life. It gave me the time I needed to learn about myself and to figure out my medication and have all the therapy I needed. It set me up for the rest of my life. It didn't fix me but it made me the person I am today and gave me back control of myself."\n\nToday, she still has therapy and is on medication.).
1.2.5.3. Con: If this were true, it would make the case for sending current prisoners to hospitals instead of prisons, not sending them to punitive prisons instead of rehabilitative ones.
1.2.6. Pro: Giving people the chance to redeem themselves through rehabilitation recognizes that humans are imperfect and should not be defined by their mistakes.
1.2.6.1. Pro: If people can go to therapy or counseling to improve their lives after a non-criminal offense, prisoners should be given the same opportunity.
1.2.6.2. Pro: There are many minor crimes for which rehabilitation is the most just response.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Argentina has implemented a [path to rehabilitation](https://insightcrime.org/news/brief/argentina-expands-drug-treatment-program-minor-crimes-nationwide/)(Argentina's national government is scaling up a pilot project that provides treatment instead of incarceration for drug addicts accused of minor crimes, an initiative that could contribute to lower rates of recidivism and prison overcrowding. \n\nArgentina's Ministry of Justice and Human Rights is preparing to implement nationwide what are known as Drug Treatment Tribunals \(Tribunales de Tratamiento de Drogas - TTD\), reported La Nación.

Under the program, drug addicts accused of minor or non-violent crimes can request that their trial be suspended in order to undergo treatment. If the rehabilitation program is considered successful, the criminal activity is expunged from the suspect's record.) instead of jail time for minor crimes, hoping to reduce recidivism.

A zero tolerance strategy consists of stopping, questioning, and frisking pedestrians or drivers considered to be acting suspiciously and then arresting them for offenses whenever possible, typically for such low-level offenses as possessing marijuana. A defining difference between zero tolerance interventions and other strategies is that zero tolerance strategies are not discerning; the focus is on making stops and arrests to crack down on all types of disorder, generically defined.\n\nZero tolerance and aggressive policing has been found to produce statistically insignificant changes in crime, on average. It also runs the risk of damaging police-community relations, both locally and even at the national level.) has a negligible impact on crime rates and damages the relationship between law enforcement officers and the communities they police.
1.2.6.2.3.3. Pro: Zero-tolerance policies set clear [disciplinary expectations](https://www.theclassroom.com/positive-effects-zero-tolerance-policy-used-schools-17208.html)(A zero tolerance policy sends a clear message, as it removes major offenders from school and allows administrators to act quickly with disciplinary consequences that are consistent, based on school policies. Teachers favor zero tolerance policies because they are clear guidelines of expectations and consequences that make students and parents accountability for the behavior of students. Administrators view zero tolerance policies as fast-acting interventions that project the message that major offenses are not tolerated in school under any circumstances. Students then have to suffer harsh consequences such as suspension, removal from school or even jail time.) and create accountability, suggesting that they could have a positive impact on reducing criminal behavior.

1.2.7. Pro: People should be encouraged to consider being a law-abiding citizen as an ethical ideal, not coerced into compliance through the threat of punishment.
1.2.7.1. Con: Some people disagree with the ethical ideals of the society they live in, making it nearly impossible to convince them that living within the law is ethically correct.
1.2.7.1.1.

1.2.7.2. Pro: Prisons are evidence of how society treats those considered the worst members of society. Focusing on rehabilitation will introduce these people to the value system they should follow.
1.2.7.3. Con: Self-interested people may not respond to appeals to higher ethics. Studies have shown that [punishment is necessary](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/crime-and-punishment-why/)(Interestingly, the research team also had their subjects fill out a questionnaire to determine their degree of Machiavellian behavior. Those who proved to be the most ruthless of the bunch offered little to nothing when there was no threat of punishment, but within the punishment paradigm, they were generous enough to stave off retribution.\n\n"These are socially intelligent, selfish people," Fehr says about the more calculating subjects. "They escape the punishments that are inherent in social interactions, because they seem to have a fine sense of when punishment is in the air.") to coerce these people into socially acceptable behaviour.
1.2.7.4. Pro: A strong sense of morality [can be taught](https://theconversation.com/why-young-people-commit-crime-and-how-moral-education-could-help-new-research-131855)(There is a significant link between moral emotions and offending behaviour in young people. Moral emotions are learnt – and more attention needs to be given to the teaching of morals in childhood to address this link between morality and crime.\n\nMy research has proved that young people are more likely to carry out violent acts if they have weak empathy, shame and guilt, and if they do not feel violence is wrong. On the surface, this may seem obvious, but the research provides a new, evidence-based clarity about the decisions that lead to crime. It was previously thought that other personal factors – such as lack of self-control or social disadvantage – or external factors like the opportunity to commit crime were at the root of why crime occurs.) to make people significantly less likely to behave criminally.
1.3. Con: The threat of punishment is an effective way to [deter](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/ccj230/chapter/8-3-deterrence/)(Thus, the basic concept of deterrence is “the reduction of offending \(and future offending\) through the sanction or threat of sanction.”) first-time offenders.
1.3.1. Con: The cruelest and most permanent punishment, the death penalty, [does not deter crime.](https://www.amnestyusa.org/a-clear-scientific-consensus-that-the-death-penalty-does-not-deter/)(Scientists agree, by an overwhelming majority, that the death penalty has no deterrent effect. They felt the same way over ten years ago, and nothing has changed since then. States without the death penalty continue to have significantly lower murder rates than those that retain capital punishment. And the few recent studies purporting to prove a deterrent effect, though getting heavy play in the media, have failed to impress the larger scientific community, which has exposed them as flawed and inconsistent.)
1.3.1.1. Pro: Many people on death row are [subsequently exonerated](https://eji.org/issues/death-penalty/)(186 people have been exonerated and released from death row since 1973.). Killing innocent people cannot reasonably be considered a deterrent.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Since 1973, [189 death row prisoners](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence)(However, as federal courts began to more thoroughly review whether state criminal defendants were afforded their guaranteed rights to due process, errors and official misconduct began to regularly appear, requiring retrials. When defendants were now afforded more experienced counsel, with fairly selected juries, and were granted access to scientific testing, some were acquitted and released. Since 1973, 189 former death-row prisoners have been exonerated of all charges related to the wrongful convictions that had put them on death row.) have been exonerated in the US.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: People who have been sentenced to death have [a number of appeals](https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/resources/dpappealsprocess)(The direct appeal is an automatic appeal given to everyone sentenced to death. The appeal is made to the state’s highest court in which someone can seek an appeal from a conviction and death sentence. In some states, this appeal is mandatory but in others, it is optional for the defendant.\n\nThe direct appeal is limited to issues from the trial. Typically, the prosecutor and the defense file briefs and oral arguments are held before a panel of judges. After reviewing the case, the judges can affirm the conviction and sentence, reverse the conviction, or reverse the death sentence.\n\nThe direct appeal for federal cases is also limited to issues from the trial, but is handled by federal courts, rather than state courts.\n\nEither losing side can then petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting a review of federal constitutional issues.) that could stay their execution; a few people being exonerated does not discredit the punishment.
1.3.1.2. Con: Regardless of consensus over its effectiveness, many people around the world support the death penalty.
1.3.1.2.1.

Con: [Support](https://psmag.com/news/meet-the-man-leading-the-push-for-more-executions-in-the-u-s)(Yet, on the other hand, the death penalty has seen a steady decline in support around the country; a 2016 Gallup poll recorded the lowest support for the death penalty since 1972. Further, 2016 had the fewest executions \(20\) since the American death penalty was reinstated in 1978.

Only 30% of death penalty supporters – and just 6% of opponents – say adequate safeguards exist to prevent innocent people from being executed.) worry that an innocent person could be put to death because there are not adequate safeguards.
1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: The death penalty is [constitutional](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/blog/on-this-day-supreme-court-temporarily-finds-death-penalty-unconstitutional)(In 1976, in a series of decisions called the Gregg cases, the Court confirmed that capital punishment was legal in the United States, but under limited circumstances. It rejected automatic sentencing to death, and said death sentences can’t be characterized by “arbitrariness and capriciousness.” The ruling led to the use by states of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in determining capital sentencing.\n\nIn later years, the Court has excluded certain classes of people from capital punishment, including the mentally handicapped and juveniles. It also eliminated rape and felony murder as capital crimes.). Constitutional laws with majority public support should be maintained.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: There is [strong domestic support](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/centres/alc/research/publications/alc-briefing-paper-series/death-penalty-and-the-road-ahead-a-case-study-of-indonesia)(Indonesia does give weight to these objections but domestic support for the death penalty still seems overwhelming. Few governments anywhere are willing to abolish the death penalty if they have to pay a high political cost and the government of President Joko Widodo is no exception.) for the death penalty in Indonesia.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: People who support the death penalty are often [misinformed](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011128707312147?journalCode=cadc)(In 1972, former Supreme Court Justice Marshall postulated that the public was uninformed about the death penalty and information would change their support for it. There is some indication that information about the death penalty may change people’s level of support. This study re-examines data used by Lambert and Clarke \(2001\). Using multivariate analyses, the impact that information has on death penalty support is tested, along with level of prior knowledge about the death penalty, personal characteristics \(gender, age, political affiliation, race, being a criminal justice major, academic level\), and religious factors. The results suggest that information on both deterrence and innocence leads to a reduction in death penalty support and views on the death penalty. Furthermore, the results suggest that the information presented may have varying effects among different subgroups of people.), lied to, or willfully ignorant about its effectiveness.

1.3.1.2.4. Con: Governments must look for [viable long-term solutions](https://www.corrections1.com/corrections-international/articles/prison-not-for-punishment-in-sweden-96Sp1P2LRnlKwNBG/)(Public opinion is another factor, and Oberg says there is a lot of anger toward criminals.\n\n“But, regardless of what public opinion may be at any time, whatever you do in the justice sector, you have to take a long-term perspective. You cannot try something one day and change it to something else the next day – that would be completely useless.

1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The death penalty is [rarely used](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-numbers-dont-lie-its-the-hard-core-doing-hard-time/)(And, by the way, between 1977 and 1993 more than 400,000 Americans were murdered, but only 226 convicted killers were executed and only 2,713 remained on death row.) to punish murder, so its efficacy as a deterrent is largely untested.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Post-abolition murder rates appear to have declined in places that abolished the death penalty.

State sanctioned killing only serves to endorse the use of force and to continue the cycle of violence)\).
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: The murder rate in [Australia](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/centres-institutes/centre-criminology/blog/2015/04/theres-no-evidence-death-penalty-acts-deterrent)(One rather unsophisticated way of considering deterrence is to analyse homicide rates before and after the death penalty is abolished. This at least can show whether countries that abolish capital punishment inevitably experience more murders, as those who support the deterrent argument claim. In Australia, where the last executions occurred in the mid-1960s, the reported murder rate has, a few fluctuations aside, fallen.) has consistently declined since the abolition of the death penalty in the mid-1960s.
1.3.1.4.3. Con: Establishing [clear causality](https://uwm.edu/letters-science/news/understanding-cause-crime-sociology-criminology/)(It is hard to pinpoint “the cause of crime”, not just because criminology is a relatively young field and still has much to discover, but because so much depends on the specific circumstances of a particular time and place. However, there are some regularities that seem pretty well-established. For example, one relatively consistent social predictor of crime is income inequality. Societies with higher levels of income inequality like the U.S. tend to suffer from higher crime rates. You compare yourself to economically well-off members of the community, and for many people, that creates economic strain or stress. This feeling of relative deprivation is associated with many kinds of criminal behavior. On the other hand, it’s probably easier to live with one’s own absolute poverty if everyone else around is also poor.) for fluctuating crime rates is difficult.
1.3.1.4.4. Pro: The murder rate in US states without the death penalty is lower than in states with the death penalty \([p. 4](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/act500152008eng.pdf)(In 2004 in the USA, the average murder rate for states that used the death penalty was 5.71 per 100,000 of the population as against 4.02 per 100,000 in states that did not use it.)\).
1.3.1.4.4.1.

If anything, the death penalty incited violence rather than curbed it.) of all executions in the US occur in the South, the region with the highest murder rate.
1.3.1.5. Con: Regardless of its effectiveness in deterring crime, the death penalty meets a key [penological](https://www.britannica.com/topic/penology)(penology, also called Penal Science, the division of criminology that concerns itself with the philosophy and practice of society in its efforts to repress criminal activities. As the term signifies \(from Latin poena, “pain,” or “suffering”\), penology has stood in the past and, for the most part, still stands for the policy of inflicting punishment on the offender as a consequence of his wrongdoing; but it may reasonably be extended to cover other policies, not punitive in character, such as probation, medical treatment, and education, aimed at the cure or rehabilitation of the offender; and this is, in fact, the accepted present sense of the term.) objective: [retribution](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/the-death-penalty-appropriate)(The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst.).
1.3.1.6. Pro: Even if one agrees that punishment is an effective deterrent, it is a greater punishment to leave criminals alive in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to kill them.
1.3.1.6.1. Pro: Some people on death row [want to die](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90935&page=1)(South Carolina appellate attorney Joe Savitz did everything he could to try to prevent the execution of Michael Passaro — not necessarily because he believed in his innocence, but because Passaro wanted to die.\n\[...\]\nPassaro pleaded guilty to murder in 2000 and requested — and received — the death penalty. Passaro did not, and never wanted, to appeal his guilty plea, and rejected his attorneys' attempts to help him.\n\[...\]\n"He does not see the death sentence as punishment. He sees it as an escape from punishment," Savitz said before Passaro's lethal injection. "He believes that he will be reunited with his first wife and the child that he killed, Maggie. He wants to die and has gotten the state to help him carry it out in what is essentially a state-assisted suicide. He is not doing this because he feels a sense of remorse."). Killing them is not, therefore, a further punishment.
1.3.1.6.2. Con: Spending decades on death row can have a severe emotional and psychological [impact](https://reprieve.org/uk/2016/10/11/death-row-phenomenon-psychological-impact-shadow-execution/)(The unique psychological impact on prisoners of long periods under the harsh conditions of death row, with the ever-present shadow of execution hanging over them, is known as death row phenomenon.\n\nThis bleak isolation and years of torturous uncertainty can result in a sharp deterioration in a prisoner’s mental and physical state, often making inmates suicidal. Many have attempted suicide in the weeks and days leading up to their executions, only to be ‘saved’ and brought back to prison so their sentence can be carried out by the authorities – in Brandon Rhode’s case in Georgia, USA, the IV port was even left in place so that the lethal injection could be administered in the same site.) on prisoners, suggesting that being sentenced to death is a terrible punishment even prior to the actual execution.
1.3.1.6.3. Pro: Some countries with the death penalty allow some prisoners on death row to [change their term](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/centres/alc/research/publications/alc-briefing-paper-series/death-penalty-and-the-road-ahead-a-case-study-of-indonesia)(The Indonesian government seems to be trying to do this in its new draft Criminal Code. This says that if a death row convict demonstrates rehabilitation, his or her sentence can be reduced to either life or 20 years in prison. If this had been the law earlier this year, it could have saved the two Australians recently executed, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. Debate on the Draft of Criminal Code is a perfect opportunity for both proponents and opponents of the death penalty. There is, however, a new momentum towards abolition in Indonesia, and this paper argues that it should be used to the maximum possible extent to prevent more executions, and outlines a strategy for how this might be done.) to life in prison or a twenty-year sentence, suggesting that spending this amount of time in prison is a similar punishment to death.
1.3.1.6.4. Con: The death penalty is considered by some to be a [cruel and unusual punishment](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/death-penalty-lethal-injection-lawsuit/629383/)(Whether killing a person via intravenous poisoning qualifies as cruel and unusual remains, for the moment, an open question. Beginning in late February, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma heard testimony at the trial of Glossip v. Chandler, an eight-year-old lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of death-row inmates that seeks to prove that Oklahoma’s current lethal-injection recipe—500 milligrams of midazolam, followed by 100 milligrams of vecuronium bromide, followed by 240 mEq potassium chloride—violates the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The case focuses on the constitutionality of midazolam, a sedative with limited anesthetic and no analgesic properties that critics argue results in slow and painful deaths for those poisoned with it.), which could arguably be worse than life in prison.
1.3.1.7.

Here, 88.2% of the polled criminologists do not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent, up slightly from 83.6% in 1996. With the not sure responses eliminated, the proportion of responses that reject the deterrence argument increased from 87.5% in 1996 to 94.3% in 2008. This difference is not statistically significant, which indicates that there has been virtually no change in the experts’ opinions over the twelve years between the two surveys.)\).
1.3.1.7.1. Pro: The majority of Americans [do not believe](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/02/most-americans-favor-the-death-penalty-despite-concerns-about-its-administration/)(Moreover, more than six-in-ten Americans \(63%\), including about half of death penalty supporters \(48%\), say the death penalty does not deter people from committing serious crimes.) that the death penalty deters crime.
1.3.2. Pro: In states that use rehabilitation, potential criminals may not be sufficiently deterred from committing crimes if they think rehabilitation is less harsh than punishment.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Deterrence does not view punishment as an end in itself, but as a means of conditioning society to avoid criminal behavior.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: From a [classic marketing standpoint](https://www.channelsight.com/blog/top-of-mind-awareness)(Top of mind awareness – or TOMA – is a key concept in market research. It is a measure of how high brands rank in the consciousness of consumers. \n\nThe first brand that comes to mind when consumers think of a certain niche, product or industry has achieved top of mind awareness. Not all consumers will think of the same brand, but the results offer a clear indication of which companies are most popular within an industry. \n\nIt’s worth noting that sometimes the first brand people think of is one they dislike or one that was recently embroiled in a scandal. So TOMA can have negative associations. However, being ‘top of mind’ is usually a big plus for brands.), punishment is the best method of deterring crime because it is the most visible.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: People in society should not be conditioned to behave in a certain way.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: Deterrence through punishment [has not been proven](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/crime-and-punishment/201804/why-punishment-doesnt-reduce-crime)(So, what is our return on investment? What have we achieved with our nearly unilateral focus on punishment? There are several ways of looking at it, but perhaps the most direct is recidivism or reoffending. The overall recidivism rate is about 70%, meaning 70% of offenders are rearrested within five years of being released from the criminal justice system. It is important to note that recidivism is a conservative measure since it only counts those who have been caught.\n\nAnother way of assessing return on investment is to statistically estimate the impact of punishment policy on crime declines. Crime in the U.S. dropped dramatically during the late 1990s and has continued a downward trend, producing historically low crime rates today. Surely that is a result of our massive expansion of prisons and jails. Unfortunately, this is not good news either. The scientific consensus is that between 10% and 15% of the crime decline in the U.S. is attributable to punishment policy.) to discourage criminality, but many countries continue to employ it, suggesting that they pursue punishment for reasons besides deterrence.

In a work release program, a correctional institution allows eligible prisoners to leave the premises of the facility to receive paid employment somewhere in the surrounding community. Once a prisoner completes a day of work, they must return to the work release facility where they remain in the custody of the correctional institution for the night \(McNeil, 2009\). These programs allow prisoners to have time outside of the prison environment and to have paid work while still technically being incarcerated.)\).
1.3.2.2.2.

In 20 states, including Minnesota and Missouri, more than half of admissions are due to supervision violations.\n\nEven more alarming is the number of people who are being sent back to prison as a result of technical violations, which are typically minor infractions, such as failed drug tests or missed curfews. According to the report, approximately 95,000 people are incarcerated as a result of technical violations on any given day. Incarcerating people for these types of infractions collectively costs states $2.8 billion annually, with 12 states each spending more than $100 million.) without breaking any rules.

Existing research suggests that both internal sanctions and, to a lesser extent, legal sanctions deter crime, but it is unclear whether this pattern is unique to Western countries or robust across cultures. We administered a survey study to participants in China, Colombia, Germany, Portugal, and USA, five countries from distinct cultural regions of the world. Participants were asked to report the likelihood of engaging in seven dishonest and illegal actions, and were asked to indicate the probability and severity of consequences for legal, friend, family, and internal sanctions. Results indicated that across countries, internal sanctions had the strongest deterrent effects on crime.)\).
1.3.2.3.1.

Policy efforts aimed at promoting moral internalization may be more effective than efforts aimed at increasing the frequency or probability of legal sentences. However, the process by which internalization occurs remains poorly understood, and marks an important direction for future research aimed at reducing crime and enhancing social welfare.)\).
1.3.2.4. Pro: If prisons became places where criminals are treated kindly and with respect, potential offenders would become less fearful of the mild consequences of committing a crime.

For evidence of this, look no further than the policy of deterrence — the basis for most of the punishments our criminal justice system doles out. Whether it’s prison itself, longer prison sentences, or sending more people to prison for smaller crimes, these prescribed consequences are usually predicated on the idea that a would-be criminal will consider them and then think twice: “Nope, I’m not going to do this,” they’ll rationally decide.” I don’t want that to happen to me.”\n\nUnfortunately, the work of Wright and Smith suggests that real people don’t often make that kind of careful deliberation before they rob somebody, and subsequent decades’ worth of research on the effects of deterrence-based punishments — including mandatory sentencing and the death penalty — have failed to prove that they do anything to reduce crime.) of being sent to prison [does not deter](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/imprisonment-and-reoffending-crime-and-justice-review-research)(This conclusion is not sufficiently firm to guide policy generally, though it casts doubt on claims that imprisonment has strong specific deterrent effects.) people from committing crime.

This is a population comparable in size to entire nations such as Bolivia, Burundi, Belgium, or Tunisia.).
1.3.3.2.

The law recognizes that leniency should be shown in some cases and offers special diversion programs for some first time offenders. To qualify for the leniency provided by the FFOA a person must:\n\n1. Have been found guilty of an offense under the section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act \(21 U.S.C. 844\).

Three-strikes laws generally mandate a life sentence for the third violation of violent felonies. For example, under California's three-strikes law, a defendant who is convicted of a felony and has previously been convicted of two or more serious or violent felonies must receive an "indeterminate term of life imprisonment." New Jersey's three-strike law is similar, stating that "a person convicted of a crime . . . who has been convicted of two or more crimes that were committed on prior and separate occasions . . . shall be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment by the court, with no eligibility for parole." Furthermore, most three-strikes laws operate across jurisdictions, meaning that violations of serious felonies in one state will count as a strike for the purposes of another state's application of their three-strikes law.).

Blacks and Hispanics charged with misdemeanors or felonies in Manhattan were more likely to receive sentences involving incarceration than were Whites \(Kutateladze et al., 2014\). First-time offenders in Georgia received longer sentences if they were Black rather than White, even after controlling for crime severity and socioeconomic status \(Burch, 2015\).)\).

1.3.4. Pro: [Classic criminology](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/organized-crime/module-6/key-issues/classical-pain-pleasure-decisions.html)(The classical view in criminology explains crime as a free-will decision to make a criminal choice. This choice is made by applying the pain-pleasure principle: people act in ways that maximize pleasure and minimize pain. Classicists believe that people are hedonistic and will seek pleasure at every opportunity and avoid pain. The way to prevent crime, according to classicism, is by deterrence-the risk of apprehension and punishment \(Beccaria, 1764; Roshier, 1989; Valasik, 2014\).) suggests that punishment is the fastest way to change behavior. As such, punishment should be the preferred means of deterring future crimes.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Changing individual behaviors depends on reinforcement and punishment \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397189/pdf/nihms-672525.pdf)(Behavior rests on the experience of reinforcement and punishment. It has been unclear whether reinforcement and punishment act as oppositely valenced components of a single behavioral factor, or whether these two kinds of outcomes play fundamentally distinct behavioral roles. To this end, we varied the magnitude of a reward or a penalty experienced following a choice using monetary tokens. The outcome of each trial was independent of the outcome of the previous trial, which enabled us to isolate and study the effect on behavior of each outcome magnitude in single trials. As expected, we found that a reward led to a repetition of the previous choice, whereas a penalty led to an avoidance of the previous choice.)\).
1.3.4.2. Pro: Punishment is a more effective motivator than being rewarded \([p. 4](https://www2.uibk.ac.at/downloads/c4041030/wpaper/2013-08.pdf)(In terms of a direct comparison of rewards and punishment, we find that punishment is overall a better motivator than rewards. In fact, when the tournament size is small, the punishment mechanism approaches the outcome attained when both reward and punishment are used. This result is largely in line with the predictions generated by learning theory. Due to the strong reinforcing nature of punishment, the probability of being the lowest performing employee is higher in smaller contests and thus punishment will be experienced more often. Over time, this effect leads to similar outcomes for punishment contests and reward and punishment contests when the number of contestants is small. The strong learning effect we find also implies that a manager using a rank-order pay scheme must use the mechanism regularly as the increases in work effort will decline if no reward or punishment is given.)\).
1.3.4.2.1.

After associating the neutral stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus, the sound of the bell alone will start to evoke salivating as a response.) requires the reward or punishment to immediately follow the behavior being targeted.
1.3.4.3.

The key authors were Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham, whose work radicalized the understanding of crime and punishment. Central themes were the theory of the rational, free-willed actor and the necessity of effective deterrence established under utilitarian principles. Beccaria and Bentham drew inspiration from social contract theories based on the willed agreement of citizens to surrender a portion of their freedom in return for the protection of their interests. The law, therefore, was a means of enforcing social order by restraining the hedonistic tendencies of a population inclined to criminal activity through calculative self-interest. The aim was to create a transparent, coherent, and egalitarian justice system in which punishment should be proportionate to the crime, swift and easily understandable by all.) and is therefore outdated.

What distinguishes them is their emphasis on individual “free will” as well as rational decisionmaking – aspects of crime that are not always emphasized by contemporary theories.

The theory behind this is that a person unknowingly tries to alleviate pangs of guilt by finding some way to grant legitimacy to their behavior. But if someone really is feeling pangs of guilt, the uneasiness they feel about their behavior is internal.

1.3.5.2.2.1. Con: Harsh prison sentences and draconian treatments have not reduced recidivism.
1.3.5.2.2.1.1.

Although prison overcrowding is a complex problem, there is no doubt that it is attributable in part to the large number of repeat offenders who populate the prisons and for whom imprisonment has had little or no effect in terms of their desistance from crime. One key strategy in reducing the number of persons in prison is to provide effective rehabilitation programmes for prisoners and support their social reintegration upon release. Unfortunately, prison overcrowding itself affects the ability of prisons to offer meaningful rehabilitation programmes and tends to limit prisoners’ access to existing programmes.)\).
1.3.5.2.2.1.2. Con: Recidivism rates are not only the result of how the criminal justice system treats its prisoners. Other factors, such as the comprehensiveness of the state's social safety net, may also explain recidivism rates \([p. 1](https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/dfy/dfy_research_report.pdf)(- After controlling for significant risk factors, most analyses found no consistent differences in recidivism by type of residential facility, residential movement pattern, type of first nonresidential service, or residential length of stay. However, for male JDs, an intermediate “step down” from residential centers to group homes was more effective in preventing short-term recidivism than direct release from residential centers to standard community care.\n\n- On-site interviews and existing literature suggested that the high recidivism rates may be attributable to \(1\) inconsistency of approach among program staff, \(2\) lack of program continuity in the transition from residential confinement to aftercare, and \(3\) lack of long-term support systems to carry youth successfully into young adulthood. These problems may also explain why differences in residential length of stay and nominal differences in residential program content did not produce consistent differences in recidivism rates.)\).

However, there is awareness of the substantive legal changes introduced by the rape reform legislation \(such as the fact that husbands are no longer immune from criminal changes involving their wives\). It is clear that rape reform legislation has affected public knowledge of statutory reforms regarding crimes of sexual aggression. Results from the experimental component of this research show that the new sexual assault label has not achieved one of the important goals, namely of changing public perceptions of the nature of crimes of sexual aggression. Indeed, one negative effect predicted by feminist writers seems to have emerged: sentencing decisions made by the public for the offense of rape were less severe when the incident was described as a sexual assault.).

In this regard, research illustrates that the general public tends to underestimate the severity of sanctions generally imposed. This is not surprising given that members of the public are often unaware of the specifics of sentencing policies. Potential offenders are also unlikely to be aware of modifications to sentencing policies, thus diminishing any deterrent effect. The absence of such data on awareness of punishment risks makes it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the deterrent effects of sanction levels and prospects.)\).

Pro: Many criminals are [never caught](https://theconversation.com/police-solve-just-2-of-all-major-crimes-143878)(As Americans across the nation protest police violence, people have begun to call for cuts or changes in public spending on police. But neither these nor other proposed reforms address a key problem with solving crimes.\n\nMy recent review of 50 years of national crime data confirms that, as police report, they don’t solve most serious crimes in America. But the real statistics are worse than police data show. In the U.S. it’s rare that a crime report leads to police arresting a suspect who is then convicted of the crime.\n\nThe data show that consistently over the decades, fewer than half of serious crimes are reported to police. Few, if any arrests are made in those cases.\n\nIn reality, about 11% of all serious crimes result in an arrest, and about 2% end in a conviction. Therefore, the number of people police hold accountable for crimes – what I call the “criminal accountability” rate – is very low.) for the [crimes](https://crimedoctor.com/robbery-facts/)(The nationwide robbery clearance rate for cities was a dismal 25.2%. Suburban counties recorded a 30% clearance rate while rural had a better record of 41%. Nationally 14% of robbery clearances were for offenders under eighteen years of age. One reason the arrest rate remains low is that most robbers and victims are strangers and witness identification is often inadequate. More commercial stores and banks are installing video cameras and it’s beginning to help. However, the picture quality has been sorely lacking in many cases due to poor equipment maintenance and videotape rotation procedures. New color cameras and digital recorders now being installed, which will make a big difference in picture quality and availability to the police.) they commit; punishment is therefore not much of a deterrent.

This is the result of a criminal justice system that makes prosecuting rape extremely rare, lengthy and difficult.) 1% of incidents of rape lead to a conviction.
1.3.5.2.5.2. Con: Some serious crimes, such as murder, have a [higher conviction rate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49986849)(Drugs offences are often discovered by the police through searches or raids, which is why charging rates are higher.\n\nMost murders are detected because of the huge investigative effort that goes into solving them.) than other crimes.
1.3.5.2.5.3. Pro: Rehabilitation at least prevents recidivism for the people who are caught and rehabilitated, no matter how many more criminals are never caught.

1.3.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.5.
1.4. Con: Removing a prisoner from society is meant to protect the public by preventing any further criminal activity and punish the offender for their criminal behavior.
1.4.1. Con: The primary focus of the criminal justice system should be the holistic rehabilitation of the individual, as the prisoner is expected to re-enter society at the end of their sentence.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Long prison sentences further disconnect convicted individuals from society, which can leave them stranded and unable to cope upon release.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Prisoners without access to new technologies might be unable to use basic tools such as email or a search engine upon their release from prison.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: One aspect of prisoners' punishment could be removing their access privileges to new and interesting technologies.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: In most prisons, contact with family members is a [right, not a privilege](https://www.apt.ch/en/knowledge-hub/detention-focus-database/contacts-outside-world/family-visits)(Family visits are a right and not a privilege, and upholding the right to family is more than just about allowing the act of visits to occur. There are many elements that must be considered – for example, material conditions for visits, and consideration for detainees with particular needs or in a situation of vulnerability.), allowing prisoners to maintain their familial networks intact.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Being allowed to [remain in contact](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/12/21/family_contact/)(The research is clear: visitation, mail, phone, and other forms of contact between incarcerated people and their families have positive impacts for everyone — including better health, reduced recidivism, and improvement in school.

Con: If a prisoner's [family members](https://nypost.com/2018/10/06/this-loving-family-raised-four-generations-of-criminals/)(Bobby Bogle wasn’t the first to break the law in his family, and he’d by no means be the last. It was a crime spree that spanned four generations and crossed multiple states from Texas to Oregon, beginning in the early 1920s — with ancestors who were moonshiners and carnival workers — and involving hundreds of felonies covering just about every genre of lawlessness, from murder and sodomy to burglary and insurance fraud.) are also criminals, allowing them to maintain contact could be counterproductive.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Removing humans from their social context is [psychologically damaging](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/psychological-impact-incarceration-implications-post-prison-adjustment-0)(Increased sentence length and a greatly expanded scope of incarceration resulted in prisoners experiencing the psychological strains of imprisonment for longer periods of time, many persons being caught in the web of incarceration who ordinarily would not have been \(e.g., drug offenders\), and the social costs of incarceration becoming increasingly concentrated in minority communities \(because of differential enforcement and sentencing policies\).\n\nThus, in the first decade of the 21st century, more people have been subjected to the pains of imprisonment, for longer periods of time, under conditions that threaten greater psychological distress and potential long-term dysfunction, and they will be returned to communities that have already been disadvantaged by a lack of social services and resources.) because humans are heavily reliant on their social groups.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Prisoners who deliberately isolate themselves within prison settings have been [diagnosed with symptoms](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/psychological-impact-incarceration-implications-post-prison-adjustment-0)(The self-imposed social withdrawal and isolation may mean that they retreat deeply into themselves, trust virtually no one, and adjust to prison stress by leading isolated lives of quiet desperation. In extreme cases, especially when combined with prisoner apathy and loss of the capacity to initiate behavior on one's own, the pattern closely resembles that of clinical depression. Long-term prisoners are particularly vulnerable to this form of psychological adaptation.) similar to clinical depression.
1.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: Harsh prison conditions alienate criminals from their community and foster poor relationships with authority figures, making it more difficult for them to reintegrate into society upon release.
1.4.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Inmates likely already had difficulty respecting authority and were likely alienated from their communities even before going to prison.
1.4.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Harsh punishment could persuade criminals to learn how to get away with crime, or encourage dishonest behavior without deterring crime in an effective manner.
1.4.1.1.3.3.

During that time, a growing scientific literature has established the catastrophic psychological impact that solitary confinement can have on juveniles and the mentally ill. In 2012, the American Psychiatric Association recommended against solitary confinement for the mentally ill; in a 2016 Washington Post article, President Obama called for a ban on solitary for juveniles; and in 2016, the US National Commission on Correctional Healthcare decried solitary confinement extending beyond 15 days as cruel, inhumane, and harmful.)\).
1.4.1.1.3.3.1.

1.4.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Torture can cause [PTSD](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/overview/)(Post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events.\n\[...\]\nSomeone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt.\n\nThey may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult.\n\nThese symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life.), a condition which will make it [more difficult](https://www.disability-benefits-help.org/working-ability/post-traumatic-stress-disorder)(The ability to continue working with post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is often dependent on the severity, frequency and duration of the symptoms you experience, including how common and pronounced your episodes or flashbacks of the triggering event are.\n\nPTSD is an anxiety disorder that results from you living through or witnessing a traumatic event in which your life or the lives of others were threatened. The exact causes of the condition are unknown, and the reason some people who experience trauma develop PTSD while others do not is not known either. Regardless, PTSD changes the way the body reacts to stress, including fundamental changes in the chemicals and hormones that communicate information in the nervous system.\n\nNot only can the symptoms of PTSD affect your ability to work, but the treatments required for managing the ailment can as well, including necessary therapy and medications.) for tortured prisoners to find employment following their release \([p. 101](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590125/pdf/10.1177_2049463713483596.pdf)(Many refugees in the developed world are survivors of torture and present with health needs without their traumatic experience being disclosed or identified. Chronic pain is a common problem, as are symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\), anxiety, depression, and other distress.)\).
1.4.1.1.3.3.2. Con: If a prisoner is [harming other prisoners or staff](https://www.nj.com/politics/2016/12/christie_vetoes_bill_limiting_solitary_confinement.html)(In his veto message, the governor said the use of administrative segregation, a form of isolation, in New Jersey's prisons "is carefully considered, and where appropriate, is guided by medical and mental health professionals considering the individual health conditions of an inmate while balancing the need to protect other inmates and staff."), putting that prisoner in solitary confinement could be a way to prevent the greater harm of allowing them to remain in the general prison population.
1.4.1.1.3.4. Con: Prisons can operate as a society inside another society where inmates have small social groups, which can create [deeper bonds](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-sociology/chapter/group-dynamics/)(Since it is easier for fewer people to agree on goals and to coordinate their work, smaller groups are often more cohesive than larger groups. Group cohesiveness may suffer, though, if the group lacks enough members to perform its tasks well.\n\nAn intimate community is one in which some members recognize and are recognized by all of the others, and most of the members recognize and are recognized by many of the others. This is in contrast to \(usually larger\) communities where members are known and interact mostly within their own subgroup, such as a neighborhood, department, or occupation.

In conclusion, this study shows that a social network approach leads to valuable insights in social organization in prison that are also relevant for prison policy.)\).
1.4.1.2. Con: Attempting to fix the prison system is always valid, even if there is little precedent for success in doing so. Success would benefit everybody enormously.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Prisons exist to serve a [variety of purposes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prison#ref272178)(There are a number of accepted reasons for the use of imprisonment. One approach aims to deter those who would otherwise commit crimes \(general deterrence\) and to make it less likely that those who serve a prison sentence will commit crimes after their release \(individual deterrence\). A second approach focuses on issuing punishment to, or obtaining retribution from, those who have committed serious crimes. A third approach encourages the personal reform of those who are sent to prison. Finally, in some cases it is necessary to protect the public from those who commit crimes—particularly from those who do so persistently. In individual cases, all or some of these justifications may apply. The increasing importance of the notion of reform has led some prison systems to be called correctional institutions.) depending on the incarcerated individual: retribution, incapacitation, specific or individual deterrence, and rehabilitation.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: In order for the system to have a chance to function properly, all stated purposes of imprisonment must be accounted for, at least to some degree.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.2.2.2.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Prisons should increasingly focus on rehabilitation as prisoners get closer to their release date.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: Rehabilitation and reintegration measures should start earlier, rather than later.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: Properly training prisoners for any skilled job in a short time frame before being released would be difficult. Instead, they should be educated and trained in preparation for future employment throughout their incarceration.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Beginning rehabilitation at the start of someone’s sentence is a waste of time if their sentence is longer than twenty years.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Some criminals are sentenced to life imprisonment, with no chance of parole. Rehabilitation for them would be a waste of time and effort.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: If criminals locked up on life sentences are deemed incapable of reform, then prisons may become hotbeds of depression and abuse as correctional officers \(and the wider community\) may consider them exiles and unworthy of compassion.
1.4.1.4.1.2.2. Con: Long sentences can be shortened, [depending on behavior](https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/criminal-defense/sentencing/what-is-good-behavior-in-prison.html)(It can be difficult for an inmate to follow all the rules and participate in programs while imprisoned. One of the ways jails and prisons keep prisoners participating is to reward them with benefits for “good behavior." Good behavior generally means following the rules and not getting in trouble. Good behavior credit can actually reduce the sentence by up to 54 days every year in some jurisdictions.\n\nGood time credit is available for individuals serving a sentence in federal prison. Many states have a similar policy. Understanding the good behavior policies and figuring out how to follow the rules can make a big difference in how you can get out of jail early.). Focusing on rehabilitation would ensure that these prisoners will be equipped to enter society upon release.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Rehabilitation while on probation is already a [standard practice](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/court-ordered-rehab-and-the-consequences-for-violations-50649)(When a person commits a crime, there are several possible outcomes such as a conviction, a program, restitution and counseling. For some, a drug rehabilitation program is an alternative sentence when convicted of certain crimes. When sentenced to this rather than jail or prison, it is because the involved judge believes that it is better to keep the person away from prison or jail and serve a long-term rehabilitation instead of the standard incarceration period. If the convicted individual is a first-time offender, a peaceful and non-violent convict or someone with a minor conviction, it is possible to receive this sentence.) employed by courts for many first-time offenders.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Rehabilitation-focused systems can optimise for time and focus on the probability of a successful reintegration into society.
1.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: By analyzing each case individually, customized rehabilitation terms would reduce the probability of judicial bias.
1.4.1.4.3.2. Con: A system where prisoners are released when they are rehabilitated may result in reformed criminals who committed severe crimes being released sooner than unreformed criminals who engaged in petty criminality.
1.4.1.4.3.3. Pro: The earlier a prisoner is [released back into society](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/breaking-cycle-mass-incarceration)(One example of this is the reduc­tion in federal drug sentences. The U.S. Senten­cing Commis­sion reduced all federal crack cocaine sentences in 2007 and made the changes retro­act­ive, so that people serving those sentences could peti­tion to get the new reduced sentence. At the time, crit­ics \(includ­ing those at DOJ\) warned that this would be a public safety disaster because these people would be back on the streets too early. But the agency model allowed the commis­sion’s decision to proceed without being blocked.\n\nWhen the commis­sion stud­ied that popu­la­tion five years later, it found that the recidiv­ism rate of those released earlier was lower than the recidiv­ism rate of those who served their full sentences. That evid­ence, in turn, paved the way for the commis­sion in 2013 to reduce all federal drug sentences retro­act­ively, not just sentences for crack. So agen­cies end up making the case for their policies because policies groun­ded in evid­ence work more effect­ively.), the better their chances of avoiding a relapse and returning to prison.
1.4.1.4.3.4. Pro: A focus on ensuring reintegration into society will make false imprisonment less burdensome. Assuming the prisoner had never committed a crime before, the process would likely move along quickly.
1.4.1.4.3.4.1. Con: Many prisons do not allow inmates to engage in rehabilitation programs [unless they admit their guilt](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/wrongly-convicted-men-launch-new-case-against-the-justice-secretary-9985773.html)(If you don’t co-operate with the prison system, you are a nonentity. It tries to force and compel you to do rehabilitation work. If I was to do it I would have to admit my guilt, and I wouldn’t do that. My resolve was to clear my name. I don’t want to let this affect me for the rest of my life. I’m living below the poverty line, but I have a degree of optimism because I have a case worth fighting and I’m not going to give up. I’ll fight as long as it needs to be fought.). People who are unjustly imprisoned may refuse to do so out of principle.
1.4.1.5. Con: Rehabilitation is a worthy goal, but being within prison walls is not conducive to building life-changing behaviors.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: When isolated from society in a concentrated population of other criminals, offenders cannot observe and practice positive interaction with society.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: People confined to prisons are part of society and are entitled to be protected from harm, even if safety concerns justify their confinement.
1.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: Prisoners need to understand how to behave in typical social and work settings, which requires being able to interact daily with common citizens, not fellow prisoners.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: Many prisoners suffer from [depression and anxiety](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Prisoner-Anxiety.aspx)(Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or fear that often comes when a person’s body responds to a critical or frightening situation. In this condition, the body prepares for an action, i.e., to fight against the threat or run away from it. When our mind prepares to cope with the threat, our body shows some physical symptoms, which vary based on the type of anxiety.\n\nThis is a common problem in people, especially among those sentenced to imprisonment. A study by the Ministry of Justice found that 23% of male and 49% of female prisoners suffer from depression and anxiety.); positive behavioural change is difficult to sustain under mental stress.
1.4.1.5.3. Con: Prison is an appropriate setting for some types of rehabilitation. Helping prisoners [gain marketable skills](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/09/prison-work-program-ohsa-whole-foods-inmate-labor-incarceration)(That incarcerated offenders often participate in prison work programs is nothing new.

Those who run these programs say the training they offer is essential for preparing prisoners to succeed in the outside world after release.) and practice positive behaviours can be carried out well in a prison context.
1.4.1.5.3.1. Pro: Rehabilitating a prisoner with viable job skills [reduces recidivism](https://www.justice.gov/archives/prison-reform)(Research shows that inmates who participate in correctional education programs have 43 percent lower odds of returning to prison than those who do not, and that every dollar spent on prison education saves four to five dollars on the costs of re-incarceration. With guidance from the Bronner Group, an educational consulting firm, BOP is building a semi-autonomous school district within the federal prison system and will offer programs for adult literacy/basic skills, high school diplomas, post-secondary education, and expanded opportunities for individuals with learning disabilities.) and provides a benefit to society when the prisoner is released.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Prison labor, or employing prisoners to work in certain industries, can help [reduce recidivism](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/09/prison-work-program-ohsa-whole-foods-inmate-labor-incarceration)(Among those with knowledge of the prison work system, it is generally believed that work experience helps reduce recidivism rates; several states, including Florida, California and Washington, have numbers showing that their program graduates a far less likely than average to reoffend.).
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Prison labor helps prisoners develop job skills that can help them gain employment upon release, [aiding their reintegration](https://www.unodc.org/dohadeclaration/en/news/2019/03/teaching-prisoners-practical-work-skills-for-a-new-chance-in-life.html)(After they have paid their debt to society, the ability of ex-prisoners to find work is undoubtedly a factor which contributes significantly to their dignity and self-reliance, their sense of belonging, and the diminished likelihood of their recidivism.\n\[...\]\nThey will teach prisoners a variety of useful vocations, and help them improve their self-esteem, decision-making capacities, and confidence in their future. Importantly, these vocations will increase their employability and offer them better work prospects, or better entrepreneurial skills to support them in the case of self-employment. Enabling their smooth transition from incarceration to freedom, prison administrations provide convicts with external certification for their practical training, with documents which do not indicate that the skills were learned in prison.) into society.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.2.

The wages for these jobs are a fraction of what similar work would earn outside of prison; in the federal prison system, for example, the pay range is between $0.12 and $0.40 per hour. A few states do not require prisoners to be paid at all.), making prison labor [akin to modern slavery](https://www.freedomunited.org/prison-labor-and-modern-slavery/)(The line between free prison labor and forced prison labor is difficult to define. The International Labour Organization \(ILO\) lists several indicators of free prison labor which, if absent, could point to conditions of modern slavery. These include the right to written consent forms, wages and working hours comparable to those of free workers, and standard health and safety measures. The ILO states that these factors must be considered “as a whole” to determine if prison labor is forced or voluntary.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\) discusses prison labor in its so-called Nelson Mandela Rules, which outline minimum standards by which to treat those incarcerated; rule 97 states that those incarcerated “shall not be held in slavery of servitude” and that they must be covered by the same wage, health, and safety standards as free citizens.).
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Inmates can [save their earnings](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/09/30/444797169/whole-foods-says-it-will-stop-selling-foods-made-by-prisoners)(Scaggs says the inmates make about $1,500 to $2,500 a year, but he isn't sure what the hourly rate of pay is.\n\n"If an inmate is serving a sentence for a few years, they can come out with a few thousand bucks \[in savings\] and a whole new skill set," he says.) from their prison jobs to help them get back on their feet after they get released.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.2.1.1.

1.4.1.5.3.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The [cost of legal goods and services](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/884989263)(After taxes, Dominique says they would take home about $54 a month, and most of that money went towards paying for things like phone calls, which could cost upwards of $5 per call or items from the canteen, like a bag of Doritos, which might be $5. Dominique says they might spend an entire day's pay on one stick of deodorant.\n\nGARCIA: And that's the case with many incarcerated people whose wages tend to get eaten up by paying for simple services - services that are often provided by private for-profit companies who split the revenue with the prison itself.) in prisons can be so astronomically high that nothing remains at the end of the month, let alone the end of their prison sentence.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.3. Con: Many of the inmates that participate in prison labor schemes are [highly motivated individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/09/prison-work-program-ohsa-whole-foods-inmate-labor-incarceration)(It is important to note, however, that participation in correctional industries programs is usually limited to the most trustworthy and motivated inmates, so it is hard to be sure exactly what factors lead to these lower recidivism rates. “You have a chicken-and-egg problem with recidivism studies,” Schrwatzapfel said.) and by their nature are less likely to reoffend.
1.4.1.5.3.1.1.4. Pro: Prison labor programs are a form of rehabilitative imprisonment; prisoners are [taught teamwork](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/09/30/444797169/whole-foods-says-it-will-stop-selling-foods-made-by-prisoners)("This is a model example of a prison-work program," Scaggs says.

He says prisoners are taught teamwork and getting job training.) and the on-the-job training provides them with skills for reintegration into society.
1.4.1.5.3.1.2. Con: Many businesses are simply [opposed to hiring felons](https://www.felonyrecordhub.com/dont-companies-hire-felons/)(Many employers won’t hire felons, believing they are dishonest and likely to commit a crime on the job. Or employers fear the public finding out they hire felons, damaging the company’s reputation and losing business.\n\nAnother reason is to protect their company. If they hire a felon who causes problems on the job, it could be viewed as negligent hiring. This might allow safety factors at work to place the business at risk and jeopardize their standing with the public.\n\nAnother issue is the stereotype: once a felon always a felon. These employers believe that a felon can’t change and will always resort back to crime at some point.), preventing skilled and experienced ex-convicts from being hired.
1.4.1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: The problem of businesses refusing to hire ex-convicts is a problem that can be solved or mitigated for the good of ex-convicts and society, not a reason to give up on rehabilitation.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3. Con: Not all criminals committed their offences because they could not get a job. Job training will not help these prisoners.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: [White-collar criminals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/white-collar-crime.asp)(White-collar crime has been associated with the educated and affluent ever since the term was first coined in 1949 by sociologist Edwin Sutherland, who defined it as "crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation."2 White-collar workers historically have been the "shirt and tie" set, defined by office jobs and management, and not "getting their hands dirty." This class of worker stands in contrast to blue-collar workers, who traditionally wore blue shirts and worked in plants, mills, and factories.) are unlikely to benefit from job skills training, as a lack of a job was not the cause of their criminality in the first place.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3.1.1. Con: White-collar criminals should not be the focus of rehabilitation programs because they are enabled by their position of power. In order to prevent recidivism among this group, their power merely needs to be taken away.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3.2. Con: In one study, only [49% of prisoners](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/03/14/5-facts-about-prisoners-and-work-before-and-after-incarceration/)(2. But prisoners fared poorly in the labor market before they were incarcerated. Of the prisoners we studied, only 49 percent of prime-age men were employed two full calendar years prior to incarceration. Of those who were employed, their median earnings were only $6,250. Only 13 percent earned more than $15,000. Indeed in any given year in the decade prior to their incarceration, only about half of prisoners had any reported earnings.) surveyed were in secure employment before their offense.
1.4.1.5.3.1.3.3. Pro: Many crimes, such as sexual offenses, are not motivated by economic factors, so job skills training would not rehabilitate these types of offenders.
1.4.1.5.3.2. Con: Suitable learning environments [make the learner feel safe](https://raccoongang.com/blog/what-makes-good-learning-environment/)(A good learning environment offers a safe platform for learners. Before you can expect learners to succeed academically, they should also feel safe both mentally and physically. While most of the schools take physical safety measures, not many learning platforms consider the mental safety of the learners.\n\nSafety in a learning environment goes beyond physical well-being. In order to maintain a safe learning environment, learners must feel supported, welcomed, and respected.), both physically and mentally; inmates are not likely to feel either in prison environments.
1.4.1.5.3.3. Con: Having a marketable skill does not immediately equate to being able to earn gainful employment.
1.4.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: People need to learn to how to market their skills, which requires social interaction.
1.4.1.5.3.4. Pro: For those who turned to crime due to a lack of education, a rough upbringing, and poverty, developing marketable skills through rehabilitation can be a way to break free from the cycle of violence.
1.4.1.5.3.4.1. Pro: Many non-profit organizations are dedicated to breaking the cyclical relationship between youth crime and poor education, and there have been some remarkable [success stories](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/stories/breaking-cycle-youth-crime-involves-learning-not-prison-cells)(Whatever It Takes \(WIT\) offers a radical blueprint for the way we work with children and young people caught up in the destructive cycle of crime.

These professionals will have the time, skills, experience and support to do whatever it takes to get alongside each child - helping them to change their lives so that, one day, their services will no longer be needed.).
1.4.1.5.3.5. Pro: Criminal rehabilitation can be administered as [a form of therapy](https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/prison-life-in-scandinavia/)(Based on figures, it’s safe to assume Norway’s criminal justice system is doing something right. Few citizens there go to prison, and those who do usually go only once. So how does Scandinavia accomplish this feat? The countries rely on a concept called “restorative justice,” which aims to repair the harm caused by crime rather than punish people.), as it is in Norway and elsewhere. Therapy in itself is not a form of punishment; even when court-ordered and enforced, it doesn't have to be unpleasant.
1.4.1.6. Con: Holistic rehabilitation is a difficult-to-measure goal that could result in unfair punishment in cases where the speed of rehabilitation does not correlate with the severity of the crime.
1.4.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.2.
1.4.1.6.2. Pro: A drug addict who stole goods from a store might take longer to be rehabilitated than the time they would have served in prison.
1.4.1.6.3. Pro: Rehabilitation does not differentiate between convicts based on the severity of the crime committed, but by their capacity to safely re-enter society.
1.4.1.7. Pro: Current methods of reintegrating prisoners, including parole conditions and invasive monitoring, are [detrimental to reintegration](https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi254)(Technology, thus, can be useful in detention, restriction and surveillance. However, constant surveillance of people, particularly through the use of devices fixed to their body, or even implanted beneath the skin, raises serious civil liberty and ethical concerns. This paper reviews developments in electronic monitoring technologies, including passive and active systems and Global Positioning Systems; describes their different applications in Australia and the relevant legislative framework; outlines their advantages and disadvantages; and reviews ethical, legal and practical issues associated with their use.).
1.4.1.7.1. Pro: Some parole tools, such as [GPS ankle monitors](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/28/digital-shackles-the-unexpected-cruelty-of-ankle-monitors)(Birts pays $30 per day – that’s $840 per month – for the privilege of wearing the bulky device.

The government uses these devices to track the location of individuals to make sure they are complying with the terms of their release, whether that’s being at home every night after a certain time or avoiding specific places.), can be so expensive and inconvenient that they drive the parolees into poverty.
1.4.1.7.2. Con: Some violent criminals should not be trusted to reintegrate into society on their own and [should be monitored](https://www.college.police.uk/research/crime-reduction-toolkit/electronic-tagging-general-offences)(A statistically significant decrease in crime is, however, seen among sex offenders who are placed on EM compared to those who are not monitored electronically.\n\nEM may increase the risk of being caught and the effort required to offend, but also allows the participant to spend more time with family, in employment, and less \(or no\) time in prison exposed to influences that may contribute to criminal behaviours.).
1.4.1.8. Con: Halfway houses produce mixed results \([pp. 49-50](http://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/jsr/article/viewFile/8038/6617)(In this analysis, we show that successful halfway house completion produces short-term and long-term positive effects even in the presence of several other variables that have significant effects on parole completion and recidivism. Moreover, when factored in with a matched set of traditional parolees, halfway house completers were almost two times as likely to successfully complete parole.\n\n\[…\]\n\nThe findings of this study do not directly confirm, but imply that certain types of offenders might benefit more from successful residential completion than others. Specifically, we may look at the parolees in the propensity-matched sample who succeed \(or fail\) regardless of halfway house programming. It makes sense to assume that people who are already predisposed to recidivate will probably not benefit a great deal from what halfway house programming has to offer.)\). There is notable improvement for parole completion rates, but not for long term recidivism.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.7.1.
1.4.3. Con: Removing a criminal from society can be expensive \([p. 4](https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/the-price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends.pdf)(Unsurprisingly, this explosion in the use of incarceration had a direct financial influence on state budgets. Creating and sustaining such a sprawling penal system has been expensive. With more people under their care, state prison systems were compelled to build new prison facilities and expand existing ones. To staff these new and expanded facilities, they also had to hire, train, and retain ever more employees. In addition to expanding the state-operated prison system, some states also began to board out increasing numbers of people to county jails, privately-run facilities, and other states’ prison systems.)\). Rehabilitating them and reintegrating them into society would be much cheaper.
1.4.3.1. Con: A focus on rehabilitation would [increase operating costs](https://voxeu.org/article/incarceration-can-be-rehabilitative)(A natural question is whether the positive effects from imprisonment found in Norway pass a cost-benefit test. The Norwegian prison system spends almost double the amount per inmate per year compared to other Western European countries and between two and four times more compared to US states.), ultimately detracting from the primary goal of prisons: incarceration.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: [Many inmates](https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/publications/future-prison-mental-health-care-england)(Poor mental health is exceptionally common in prison. 45% of adults in prison have anxiety or depression, 8% have a diagnosis of psychosis, and 60% have experienced a traumatic brain injury. Being imprisoned can exacerbate mental health difficulties, and there are too many avoidable remands and short sentences where a community alternative could have been viable. In recent years prison suicides have reached record levels, and so too have recorded self-harm and violence.) have severe mental illnesses that would be cost-prohibitive to effectively treat.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Mentally ill criminals incapable of rehabilitation would be better suited for treatment in a secure psychiatric facility than in a prison.

1.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.9.4.2.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: If inmates have a serious mental illness, they should be treated regardless of whether or not rehabilitation is the goal.

1.4.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.3.1.2.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: If prisons focus on rehabilitation, people may deliberately commit crimes in order to gain access to the more comfortable prison environments and rehabilitation services.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: In Japan, [20% of arrests](https://www.businessinsider.com/japan-senior-crime-rate-turning-prisons-into-nursing-homes-2017-1?r=US&IR=T)(Japan's petty thieves aren't all miscreant teens and wayward adolescents. They're grandparents.\n\nThe share of crimes committed by the elderly in Japan has risen dramatically in recent years.

So it's sort of a win-win situation either way," Shinko told NPR.) are of people over 65, primarily because prison offers many older people a more stable and comfortable life than the insecurity and unemployment facing them outside prison.
1.4.3.1.3.2. Con: If people are deliberately committing crimes to end up in prison, the problem is with the unacceptability of social conditions outside of prison, not with the comfort of the prison.
1.4.3.1.4. Con: Opting to let [volunteers and volunteer organizations](https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/prisons/volunteering-prison/)(Volunteering in prison\n\nPeople often express interest in becoming involved in our prison support work.\n\nUsually, Samaritans who volunteer in prisons are more experienced volunteers.

Your local branch would be delighted to hear from you.) develop and run prison rehabilitation programs would allow institutions to rehabilitate prisoners with limited impact on their budget.
1.4.3.1.4.1. Con: Making volunteers deliver rehabilitation sessions does not reduce the overall cost to society but merely [shifts the burden onto someone else](https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/charities-are-needed-because-the-current-social-order-is-rotten-sector-leaders-told.html)(Modern socialists believe that charities are very much needed but their very existence serves to highlight that the current social order has failed, Owen Jones told an audience of charity leaders last night. \n\nThe Guardian columnist and political activist used a speech in front of charity leaders to criticise government funding cuts, the Lobbying Act and philanthropy. He also warned against allowing volunteering to take the place of paid work and said public services should be mainly delivered “in-house” by the state.).
1.4.3.1.4.2. Con: Volunteers providing their time and resources to rehabilitate prisoners is arguably a less stable system than allocating an appropriate, taxpayer-funded budget to address the issue.
1.4.3.1.4.3. Pro: Many emotionally difficult jobs are performed by people who consider them [vocations](https://hbr.org/2010/09/why-is-it-that-we.html)(So why do men get dinged for placing themselves in positions where they have to be even-tempered with bratty pupils or fawning with arrogant jerks? As the researchers point out, many positions requiring emotional labor are “vocations” — callings — rather than just jobs. And we all know employers can get away with paying less for a calling, even if there’s a paltry supply of candidates. \(The Roman Catholic priest shortage is a great example: The compensation is still just as lousy as it was when there was no shortage.\)). Many of these people may be willing to provide rehabilitation to prisoners for free.
1.4.3.2. Pro: If incarceration were focused on rehabilitation, the length of a prisoner’s sentence could be customized according to how long it takes for them to be successfully rehabilitated, potentially saving taxpayers money.
1.4.3.3. Pro: [Prisons are overcrowded](https://www.penalreform.org/issues/prison-conditions/key-facts/overcrowding/)(Prison overcrowding is one of the key contributing factors to poor prison conditions around the world. It is also arguably the biggest single problem facing prison systems and its consequences can at worst be life-threatening at best prevent prisons from fulfilling their proper function.\n\nPrisons in over 118 countries exceeded their maximum occupancy rate, with 11 national prison systems at more than double their capacity.). An approach that safely releases rehabilitated criminals early would reduce overcrowding and associated costs.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: One prisoner [missing parole](https://theconversation.com/the-inside-story-on-crime-within-prison-114075)(Prisoners who are unable to achieve parole due to their behaviour in prison can also result in costs to the taxpayer. The average cost of one prisoner in Australia’s prisons is almost $300 per day. Every extra day served is a substantial cost to society.) due to bad behavior in a prison costs Australian taxpayers $300 per day.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: Prisoners who misbehave in prison deserve to remain locked up, regardless of the extra cost to taxpayers.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.6.1.1.4.
1.4.3.4. Con: Execution or penal labor are cheaper alternatives to rehabilitating or imprisoning a criminal.

1.4.3.5.1.2. Con: Repeat offenders are often [incarcerated multiple times](https://prisonreformtrust.org.uk/new-prison-app-reveals-major-challenges-to-rehabilitating-our-penal-system/)(Prison has a poor record for reducing reoffending – 47% of adults are reconvicted within one year of being released. For those serving sentences of less than 12 months this increases to 58%. Reoffending by all recent ex-prisoners costs the economy between £9.5 and £13 billion per year. As much as three quarters of this cost can be attributed to former short-sentenced prisoners: some £7-10 billion a year.) in punishment-based systems.
1.4.3.5.1.3. Pro: The costs of investigating, arresting, and convicting a reoffending criminal will not be needed if dangerous prisoners are never released from prison.
1.4.3.5.2. Pro: The US could save $200 billion over ten years by [reducing](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180514-do-long-prison-sentences-deter-crime)(But having prisoners serve long sentences can overcrowd prisons. It’s also extremely costly to tax payers.

Rehabilitation is the best way to reduce the prison population.
1.4.3.5.2.1. Pro: Drug rehabilitation programs can save society [billions of dollars](https://dualdiagnosis.org/drug-rehab-instead-of-prison-could-save-billions-says-report-2/)(- The first treatment of drug treatment does not need to be as costly as a incarceration.\n- Recovering addicts tend to commit fewer costly crimes and be arrested less often, reducing the price of incarceration.\n- The long-term health of each individual is improving as a result of the healthcare reform, so the cost of healthcare for uninsured patients is decreasing significantly.\n- If crime rates fall and fewer arrests occur, costs of law enforcement and court fees may be reduced.\n\nTaking drugs as a second offense would save $4.8 billion over time if ten percent of drug offenders were treated first instead of being imprisoned. If 40 percent of drug offenders received treatment instead of jail time, the government would be able to save $12.9 billion.) compared to sending addicts to prison.
1.4.3.5.2.1.1. Con: Saving money is not as important as providing a safe environment for all citizens to live in without fear.
1.4.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Many recreational drug users live in fear of spending years in prison. A drug policy that does not criminalize users would improve their lives.
1.4.3.5.2.1.1.2.

Violence was reported by 97% \(94.7 to 99.1\) of the subjects \(including cases without personal involvement\). Acts of violence such as verbal arguments, physical fights, threats, death threats, theft, and drug trafficking were significantly higher among crack users. A decrease in frequency of sexual intercourse was observed among users of injected drugs, though prostitution was observed as a means of obtaining drugs. A high number of crack cocaine users had a history of previous imprisonment, many for drug-related infractions). Society should be protected from them, and the simplest way to do this is to put them in prison.
1.4.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: Drug abuse prevention and awareness programs could receive the excess budget savings from reduced prison costs to decrease the incarceration rate further.
1.4.3.5.2.2. Con: There are [more effective methods](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/end-mass-incarceration/cutting-jail-prison-populations)(Bren­nan Center for Justice research has shown that nearly 40 percent of U.S. pris­on­ers are incar­cer­ated with little public safety rationale.

1.4.3.5.2.3. Pro: In New York, it costs taxpayers [$60,000 per year](https://www.cornellrooseveltinstitute.org/econ/the-cost-of-incarceration)(When looking at the breakdown of prison costs by state, all states analyzed on the VERA Institute of Justice report spend an amount of money that exceeds their allotted budget. For example, in 2010, the state of New York, one of the states with the greatest level of spending on prisoners, had a $2.7 billion prison budget, but the total cost amounted to $3.6 billion. In addition to funds directly related to correctional services, the state must provide money for administration purposes, such as pension and retiree health care contributions to corrections employees, employee benefits, and services for inmates. Inevitably, the cost of such a large-scale war on crime project will be exorbitant, and a bit unreasonable as well. To put things in perspective, New York spends on average about $60,076 per inmate, but only $20,639 per public student in their K-12 education system.) to keep a person in prison.
1.4.3.5.3. Pro: For every dollar invested in prison education, [US taxpayers save](https://sites.northwestern.edu/npep/benefits-of-prison-education/)(Another study found that for every $1 invested in prison education, taxpayers save $4-$5 in re-incarceration costs during the first three years post-release.) four to five dollars in re-incarceration costs.
1.4.3.5.4.

The Norwegian prison system spends almost double the amount per inmate per year compared to other Western European countries and between two and four times more compared to US states.) than those based on punishment.
1.4.3.5.4.1. Con: While rehabilitation-based systems cost more per year, they cost less in the long run because the inmates [are less likely to re-offend](https://theconversation.com/why-rehabilitation-not-harsher-prison-sentences-makes-economic-sense-132213)(An international comparison reveals some interesting trends. Norway moved its focus from punishment to rehabilitation \(including for those who were imprisoned\) 20 years ago. This was followed by large reductions in reoffending rates. Compared to a reoffending rate of around 50% within a year in the UK, Norway’s is around 25% in five years.\n\nThere is much to learn from this. A lot of people processed within the criminal justice system have vulnerabilities that can make them prone to offending, which might suggest why rehabilitation can be so successful. Recent evidence suggests that the UK prison population has serious levels of self-harm. And a recent report finds that 90% of the UK’s prison population suffer from metal health problems. Releasing such people without investing in their treatment is bound to lead to reoffending.).
1.4.3.5.4.2. Pro: Spending a great deal of money on improving the lives of criminals when that money could be spent on schools or hospitals is unethical.
1.4.3.5.5. Pro: While rehabilitated prisoners reduce state expenditure upon release, they simultaneously make active contributions to society and begin to pay taxes.
1.4.3.5.6. Pro: [More than 45%](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp)(Offense - # of inmates - % of inmates\n\n\[...\]\n\nDrug Offenses - 64,858 - 45.3%) of US prisoners are in prison for drug offenses. Sending these people to rehabilitation centers instead of prison would save a lot of money.
1.4.3.5.6.1.

1.4.3.6. Pro: Effectively rehabilitating convicted criminals would allow the community to benefit from reduced spending on social welfare.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: States may spend less on social welfare if the rehabilitated returning prisoner does not reoffend, allowing them to support their family.
1.4.3.6.2. Pro: Government expenditure on unemployment benefits should decline if rehabilitated prisoners find it easier to get jobs upon release.
1.4.3.6.3. Con: People with a criminal record may be [barred from receiving social welfare](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/13/welfare-reform-law-food-assistance-ban)(But when Glover applied for food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \(Snap\), colloquially known as food stamps, he received a notification from the Arizona department of economic security.\n\nIt was a message that unsettled his belief that the end of his sentence represented a clean break with his past: because his felony conviction was drug-related, he was not eligible for Snap, and his claim had been denied. “I thought, wait a minute, I finished my sentence. Why am I still being punished?” said Glover. “You shouldn’t miss a meal because you were incarcerated or have a history of drug activity. That doesn’t seem right.”). If this were the case, rehabilitation would not be necessary to avoid an increase in welfare expenditure.
1.4.3.7. Con: Forcing the victim or innocent citizens to pay taxes to rehabilitate the prisoner is unfair. The victim should be [indemnified](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/5-107-6256?transitionType=Default&contextData=\(sc.Default\)&firstPage=true)(In its widest sense, "indemnity" means recompense for a loss or liability.\n\nSome indemnity claims arise by operation of law. For example, the law of agency makes a principal liable to indemnify its agent as described in Practice note, Common law of agency: Duty of principal to pay the agent's expenses and indemnify it against losses.\n\nMany indemnities are created by contract, under which the paying party promises to pay an identified loss. The trigger for payment and the amount payable depend on the contract's drafting and interpretation.) instead.
1.4.3.7.1. Con: Victims' taxes help maintain the criminal regardless of whether they are punished or rehabilitated. There should be a focus on making sure those funds are invested in projects with the highest long-term return.
1.4.4. Pro: Locking people up prevents crime while the prisoners are behind bars.
1.4.4.1. Con: Modern prisons are [essentially schools](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706820?journalCode=jle)(For certain types of crimes, we find that inmates strengthen their criminal capital in prison because of exposure to offenders in their field of specialization \(reinforcing peer effects\). Our results accord with a theory of crime-specific knowledge transmission and network building: we find reinforcing peer effects for crimes that require specific capital, planning, and networks \(for example, drug crimes, theft, burglary, and fencing\) and/or are more effective when committed in groups \(for example, threats and vandalism\). Reinforcing peer effects are especially strong because of exposure to more experienced criminals.) for teaching people how to commit crimes, with lessons taught by fellow inmates.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Low-level criminals have been [radicalised into violent terrorists](https://me.eui.eu/dieter-reinisch/blog/radicalization-in-prison/)(All too often, media outlets report on young men who entered Western European prisons as petty criminals and, over time, radicalized, eventually conducting terrorist attacks in the name of ISIS. Today, prisons are viewed as one of the primary areas of terrorist recruitment in Europe, but this has not always been the case. Merely two decades ago, paramilitary activists deradicalized in Northern Irish prisons, as IRA members transformed into active supporters of the Irish peace process. How did it work? And what can this historical case study teach us about confronting radicalization today?) in prison.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Criminal enterprises have adapted to prison and usually have a command structure within that protects their own \([p. 43](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/123148NCJRS.pdf)(All research projects or studies share one common purpose: the exploration of new knowledge. In the understanding of criminal behavior, especially that of prison gangs, very limited information is available in the existing literature. It was for this reason that the present study was conducted.\n\nInitially, it was predicted that the Texas Syndicate and the Mexican Mafia would differ from each other in terms of \(1\) organizational structure, \(2\) leadership style, \(3\) methods of recruitment, \(4\) gang activities and goals, \(5\) operational strategies, and \(6\) gang activities outside the prison setting. The findings, however, reveal that such is not the case. On the contrary, both groups share similar characteristics. A question that may result from this study is whether all inmate gangs in the prison environment share similar characteristics as evidenced by the Texas Syndicate and the Mexican Mafia. Clearly, the answer to this question is that further research of prison gangs is needed)\). The dissuading power of prison is decreased when a gang holds [de facto control](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/how-gangs-took-over-prisons/379330/)(Originally formed for self-protection, prison gangs have become the unlikely custodians of order behind bars—and of crime on the streets.) over the facility.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: The [levels of surveillance](https://news.trust.org/item/20211122213228-wxsz9/)(When the sheriff in Suffolk County, New York, requested $700,000 from the U.S. government for an artificial intelligence system to eavesdrop on prison phone conversations, his office called it a key tool in fighting gang-related and violent crime.\n\nBut the county jail ended up listening to calls involving a much wider range of subjects - scanning as many as 600,000 minutes per month, according to public records from the county obtained by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nBeginning in 2019, Suffolk County was an early pilot site for the Verus AI-scanning system sold by California-based LEO Technologies, which uses Amazon speech-to-text technology to transcribe phone calls flagged by key word searches.\n\nThe company and law enforcement officials say it is a crucial tool to keep prisons and jails safe, and fight crime, but critics say such systems trample the privacy rights of prisoners and other people, like family members, on the outside.) in prisons are increasing. This decreases the likelihood of prisoners being able to teach each other criminal methods without being caught.
1.4.4.1.4. Con: The most dangerous prisoners, including [leaders of organized crime rings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/18/italian-mafia-boss-wins-legal-right-to-play-music-in-his-solitary-prison-cell)(An Italian mafia boss in solitary confinement has won a legal fight to be allowed to listen to music in his cell.\n\nDomenico Strisciuglio, 48, had been sentenced to more than 20 years under Italy’s strict prison regime for murder and other mafia-related crimes. The rules, known as Article 41-bis of the Prison Administration Act, allow the authorities to suspend certain prison regulations, with the aim of cutting inmates off completely from their criminal associates.), are kept separate from other prisoners. As such, they are unlikely to be able to organize or teach criminal activity.
1.4.4.1.4.1. Con: Even in isolation, many gang leaders can still [get messages](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-larry-hoover-gangster-disciples-coded-messages-prison-20210209-r4krd4ruzvg2biljoyzbpjikg4-story.html)(Federal prosecutors in Chicago say Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover still holds sway over the gang’s hierarchy from a Colorado supermax prison, alleging that he secretly communicated with an underling several years ago through coded messages hidden in a dictionary.) to their emissaries within and outside the prison walls.
1.4.4.1.5. Pro: Exposure to dangerous inmates and unscrupulous guards could seriously damage prisoners' social skills. This could create an even more dangerous criminal subculture than before.
1.4.4.1.5.1. Pro: [In the Soviet Union](https://www.france24.com/en/20190313-russias-powerful-thieves-law-face-reckoning-under-putin)(The 'Thieves in Law' emerged in the Soviet-era gulags, controlling the criminal underworld in Stalin's prison camps.\n\nThey developed their own subculture and jargon, similar to Italy's Cosa Nostra or the Yakuza in Japan, and were both lionised and feared.\n\nThey flourished in the chaos that followed the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, building huge criminal empires and branching out across Europe, the Middle East and North America.), entire criminal subcultures developed in prison camps.
1.4.4.1.5.2. Pro: Correctional officers in primarily punishment-based facilities could be more inclined to [abuse their position](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/more-than-2500-prison-staff-disciplined-in-five-years-moj-figures-show)(More than 2,500 prison staff have been subject to disciplinary action in the last five years, including for relationships with inmates, assaulting prisoners and racism, the Guardian can reveal, as the government prepares to launch a unit to tackle corruption in jails.\n\nA total of 2,666 prison staff in England and Wales were subject to disciplinary action between mid-2013 and mid-2018, according to data released by the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) under the Freedom of Information Act.) and harm the prisoners.
1.4.4.1.5.2.1. Pro: Guards abusing their positions of power would [constitute a crime](https://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/19897564.hmp-haverigg-prison-officer-arrested-suspected-misconduct/)(A PRISON worker at HMP Haverigg has been arrested by organised crime officers.\n\nThe 49-year-old woman from Millom was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit said.\n\nShe was taken to a police station for questioning having been arrested by officers from the Regional Prison Intelligence Unit yesterday.\n\nShe has since been released under investigation.), increasing the crime rate.
1.4.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: Guards abusing their position could leave prisoners disillusioned on release, resulting in a higher crime rate.
1.4.4.1.5.2.3. Con: [Abuse of power](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/uk-prison-officers-punching-inmates)(Prison officers are allegedly punching compliant inmates who they suspect might misbehave in the future in a practice known as “preventive strikes”, a European human rights watchdog has said in a damning report on the state of jails in England.\n\nA delegation from the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture \(CPT\), part of the human rights organisation the Council of Europe, inspected three local male prisons – Liverpool, Wormwood Scrubs in west London and Doncaster – in May last year.) is rampant in the [prison system](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/12/20/spotting-the-red-flags-of-abusive-prison-guards)(The judge, John Gleeson of the Eastern District of New York, noted there were “red flags all over the employment history” of the guard, who had been the target of numerous other abuse claims brought by inmates, according to a transcript of his remarks. But the complaints, which were handwritten, were filed internally and “buried in the prison’s arcane filing system,” which organizes claims by inmate identification numbers, not the officers involved, Gleeson said.\n\nIt was a startling observation — that prison officials had no way of tracking problems with guards. But lawyers and prisoners’ rights advocates have long complained about the issue throughout the state prison system), even with rules in place to prevent it. There is no reason to assume that rehabilitation would be different.
1.4.4.1.5.2.3.1. Con: Since retributive justice systems are based on the principle of harming those who have broken society’s rules, they are more inclined to lead to abuses of power.
1.4.4.1.5.2.3.2. Con: A general pivot towards rehabilitation would encourage more social workers and mental health specialists to work in prisons. The presence of these professionals, coupled with the retraining of correctional officers, should reduce the risk of abuse.
1.4.4.1.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: Prison staff could be retrained to become rehabilitators with experience and expertise in pedagogy, psychology, and dynamic security \([p. 5](https://www.epta.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EPTA_05_SIG2-Dynamic-Security_EN_def.pdf)(Dynamic security is a concept and a working method by which staff prioritizing the creation and maintenance of everyday communication and interaction with\ninmates based on high professional ethics, and that there is sufficient purposeful and meaningful activity to occupy prisoners, bound by effective security. It aims to better\nunderstand inmates and assess the risks they may pose as well as ensuring safety, security and good order, contributing to rehabilitation and preparation for release. This concept should be understood within a broader notion of security which also comprises structural, organisational and static security.)\).
1.4.4.1.5.2.3.2.1.1. Con: In general, training in prisons is inadequate. Retraining prison guards to become mental health professionals is unlikely to be a successful endeavor \([p. 1](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/63191/900718-Prisoner-Abuse-Is-Avoidable.pdf)(Another ticket to abuse is reliance on administrators and troops largely untrained in prison management.)\).
1.4.4.1.5.2.3.3. Pro: Disinterested and antagonistic correctional officers are partly responsible for failed rehabilitation programs in the UK \([p. 111](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1748895818800743)(Rehabilitative interventions – notably Offender Management Programmes \(OMPS\) and work placements – are perceived to be self-serving in rationale. They are experienced as ill-resourced, superficial in approach and unlikely to engender change. The prison climate, characterized by a lack of interest among correctional staff, lack of empathy and concern, and mixed – but often impersonal and sometimes antagonistic – relationships between prison staff and prisoners, further disrupts any ethos of rehabilitation.)\).
1.4.4.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.4.1.
1.4.4.1.5.4. Con: The criminal subculture of street gangs could easily create the same conditions for worsening social compatibility; this issue is not unique to prisons.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.
1.4.4.3. Con: As [criminality is pervasive](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/crimes-courts-and-cops/201001/everyones-criminal)(That although we like to think of criminals as being very different from us, they're actually not. Of course, I am not saying that you are a murderer or rapist \(although, maybe you are\); but often the difference between us and someone with a criminal record is one of degree or chance. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, a definition from the American Heritage Dictionary: Criminal - n. A person who has committed or been legally convicted of a crime. Notice the disjunctive; you are a criminal if you have violated a criminal law, regardless of whether you were convicted. And keep in mind that criminal laws are incredibly broad in their applicability.) in society, locking up enough people to ensure the safety of others may result in most of the global population being imprisoned.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Career criminals find it much more difficult to [organise criminal enterprises while imprisoned](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/crime-bosses-prison-jail-crackdown-cut-off-high-security-new-plans-justice-secretary-david-gauke-a8241221.html)(Crime bosses who run gangland empires from their prison cell will be cut off from the outside world in high-security jails, under a new crackdown.\n\nThe Justice Secretary will outline plans to expand the criteria for locking up offenders in the most tightly controlled jails, to include the likelihood of them pursuing criminal activity while inside.\n\n\[...\]\n\nThe more secure prisons involve higher and more dangerous walls, double internal fencing with motion detectors, 24/7 dog patrols, enhanced intelligence staffing, embedded counter-terror units, armoured vehicles and technology to disrupt mobile signals.\n\nThere are onsite hospitals to mitigate the need for any prisoner to leave, as well helicopter wire to stop aircraft approaching.\n\nCritically, those going in and out of the jails are subject to much stricter searches, including rub downs and a full-body scanner to identify objects hidden internally.).
1.4.4.4.1. Con: Some crime bosses have still managed to run their empires [while incarcerated](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/71-years-for-cocaine-trafficking-group-led-from-prison)(71 years for cocaine trafficking group led from prison\n\nA convicted drug dealer who continued to run his criminal enterprise from prison has been jailed for 25 years alongside associates who helped him fix deals on the outside and launder the profits.).
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Depending on the nature of the criminal organisation, arresting key figures may result in a decline in crime rates \([p. 10](https://docs.iza.org/dp12534.pdf)(In hierarchical structures like the Mafia, removing a single leader may have little impact on overall crime, since there is always a lower-level leader in place who is ready to move up in the hierarchy. The Chicago Mafia, for example, continued their operations after their most notorious leader, Al Capone, was put in prison in 1932. \n\[...\]\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that most organized crime structures are not as hierarchical as the Mafia. In fact, many can be described as loose associations of independent contractors or brokers, each with their own specific skills or resources. These brokers work in a chain-like crime production system that produces a well-defined product. Arresting one key link can break this chain and lower crime.)\).
1.4.4.5. Pro: Every criminal that gets re-arrested after being released from prison provides proof that crimes were prevented while they were locked up.
1.4.4.5.1. Con: Criminals that never reoffend are examples of crime not being prevented simply because someone is behind bars.
1.4.4.6. Con: Separating criminals from would-be victims by putting them in prison prevents crime regardless of whether the focus of the prison is rehabilitative or for punishment.
1.4.5. Con: Being separated from society is not necessarily a punishment.
1.4.5.1. Pro: If deprivation of liberty were a punishment, military personnel would experience punishment most of the time, except when they are on leave.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Joining the military to avoid imprisonment is [occasionally suggested](https://www.stripes.com/news/judge-said-army-or-jail-but-military-doesn-t-want-him-1.44417)(The judge is willing to give him a conditional discharge Bookstaver said. One of the conditions of that discharge, in a sense, is that he follow through on his own desire to join the military.\n\nHe said the judge did not want to sentence Guerra to probation because her understanding is that would preclude him from joining the Army.) by judges, suggesting that the military is akin to punishment.
1.4.5.2. Con: Exile, the most extreme form of separation from society, was long considered the only [alternative to the death penalty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/exile-law)(In Rome, exile \(exsilium\) arose as a means of circumventing the death penalty \(see capital punishment\). Before a death sentence was pronounced, a Roman citizen could escape by voluntary exile. Later, degrees of exile were introduced, including temporary or permanent exile, exile with or without loss of citizenship, and exile with or without confiscation of property. The Romans generally determined punishment by class, applying sentences of banishment to the upper classes and sentences of forced labour to the lower classes.) for certain crimes.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Some US states still allow people to be [banished to other states](https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/423018-bring-back-exile-as-a-sentencing-option/)(Justices in Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas, Florida and Kentucky still have intra-state exile as options during sentencing. Although the Court of Appeals for Mississippi has said exile must reasonably resemble the goals of probation including rehabilitation and the defendant’s constitutional rights must not be violated. Some states find that exile benefits a criminal by separating them from association with other criminal friends in their home county. Exile is also still used by various Native American tribes to banish criminals from the reservations.) as a form of punishment.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Many individuals and groups of people function separately from modern society.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Separation, in the context of prison, is the forcible involuntary exclusion from society as a punishment. Someone who has deliberately chosen to leave society is able to return, while prisoners do not have that option.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: Some individuals willingly separate themselves from society, preferring to live "[off the grid](https://morningchores.com/living-off-the-grid/)(In its most basic form, living “off-grid” means your home isn’t connected to a local power grid. If the power you use in your home is from a municipal power hub, then you’re on the grid.\n\nYou have to pay money to use grid power and there’s an outage at the main hub \(or if your local lines are damaged\), your power will go down. This can cause a few hours of inconvenience or it can mean several days without water for rural folks whose pumps are powered by electricity.\n\nWhen you’re living off-grid, it means that you either have a power source of your own, or you’re living without electricity. You might also be disconnected from other municipal lines such as water and sewage. Maybe you have an outhouse and a well, or a septic tank and a rainwater catchment system.)."
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: Mental hospitals, retreats, communes, boarding schools, monasteries, and others separate people from society. These institutions are highly valued by many and are not considered to be a punishment.
1.4.5.3.3.1. Con: A key difference is whether or not the subject is being removed from society willingly. In general, people go to monasteries voluntarily, but not to mental hospitals.
1.4.5.3.3.2. Con: Some institutions designed to separate their inhabitants from society can have [long-term detrimental](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/08/boarding-school-syndrome-joy-schaverien-review)(I once knew an American psychoanalyst who worked in a Bangkok practice, specialising in expats.

He never went home: there was more than enough work. “Specifically,” he said, “with people like you. Middle-aged, middle-class Brits who went to your crazy private schools may just about be the most damaged social sub-group I’ve ever come across.”\n\nIt’s long been known that the practice of sending young children off into the care of strangers is not wholly safe. The ancient “public” schools worried the Victorians as much or more than did the workhouses: three parliamentary commissions sat in the 19th century to look at the financial frauds, riots and the astonishing numbers of deaths – from suicides, assaults by teachers and pupils, starvation, epidemics – in the schools of the rich. Tom Brown’s Schooldays only scraped the surface.) impacts on those who attend them.
1.4.5.3.3.3. Pro: Drug rehab facilities and psychiatric hospitals isolate people, allowing them to undergo treatment and rehabilitation without risking harm to the public or themselves.
1.4.5.4. Con: Criminals are punished by the act of being imprisoned. The removal of one's liberty and loss of time is the ultimate punishment.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Prison and the deprivation of freedom themselves are not considered a penance. Penance is what one does to atone for their crimes or infractions to try to repair the damage.
1.4.5.4.1.1. Con: Prison sentences reflect the debt owed to society for violating its laws and have nothing to do with penance or restitution to the victim.
1.4.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Convicts are free to pursue penance and/or forgiveness from the victim once their debt to society has been repaid.
1.4.5.4.1.2. Pro: Prisons prevent inmates from repairing any damage caused and only delay their penance. The deprivation of freedom also prevents them from learning from their mistakes.
1.4.5.5. Pro: Separation from society is only considered a punishment if the separation is [deliberately intended to punish](https://parentingbeyondpunishment.com/separation-discipline-macnamara/)(The one theme that pervades disciplinary approaches used in homes and schools today is that they are separation based by design. Separation-based discipline refers to the removal of something a child cares about for the purpose of getting compliance and to reduce certain types of behaviour.\n\nSeparation based discipline comes in many forms but is commonly referred to as time-outs, 123 magic, pretending to leave a child when they don’t follow, taking away things they care about until they comply, ignoring and giving them the ‘cold shoulder’, punishing them with spanking, or shaming them in front of others. They are other forms of separation-based discipline, but the underlying theme is the same – if you misbehave you will face separation from the things you care about.\n\nThe hope in using this approach is that the pain inflicted will teach a child a lesson they will remember the next time they act.) an individual or group.
