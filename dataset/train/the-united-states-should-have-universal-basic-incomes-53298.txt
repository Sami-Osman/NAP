Discussion Name: The United States should have Universal Basic Incomes

1. The United States should have universal basic incomes.
1.1. Pro: Increases financial security and decreases financial stress.
1.1.1. Con: UBI could cause runaway [inflation](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/compensation/universal-basic-income-ubi/), which would make people less financially secure in the long run.
1.1.2. Pro: Based on a US-based survey, around [72%](https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/financial-stress) of respondents say they feel stressed about money.
1.1.3. Pro: The increased financial security could drive people to do what they are passionate about instead of having an unfulfilled job to pay the bills.
1.2. Pro: Possible solution to mass unemployment via automation.
1.2.1. Con: Automation is actually increasing jobs within the workforce. The World Economic Forum predicts automation will result in a net increase of 58 million jobs. ARK Investment Management predicts automation will add five percent, or $1.2 trillion, to U.S. GDP in the next five years.

1.2.2. Pro: [According to a study](https://slate.com/technology/2021/03/job-loss-automation-robots-predictions.html), 45 million people in the US, or about a quarter of the workforce, could lose their jobs due to automation by 2030.
1.3. Con: A UBI would make citizens dependent on the government.
1.3.1. Con: A UBI doesn't prevent anyone from earning other incomes, they could work jobs or generate income in any other way as per usual.
1.3.1.1. Con: Encourages Laziness within people
1.3.1.1.1. Con: A UBI could also encourage people to pursue careers in areas where they are more passionate, but don't necessarily earn them a lot of money.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: The financial security provided by the UBI could lead people to focus on continuing education.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Education is good because fewer people are receiving degrees which means that we will have nobody to fill the jobs that past generations are retiring from.
1.3.1.1.3. Con: With automation and AI increasing, people just don't have to work that much anymore.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: Laziness isn't inherently bad, it's an incentive driven decision against doing tasks while underpaid or overworked.
1.3.1.1.5. Pro: Since their financial needs are covered to a large extent by the UBI, people could work much less than they do today.
1.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: In [four controlled experiments](https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/universal-basic-income-harms-recipients-and-increases-dependence-government) in six states between 1968 and 1980 it was shown that the UBI significantly reduced the annual working hours of the recipients.
1.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: As a result, for every $ 1,000 additional benefit, there was an [average decrease in income of $ 660](https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/universal-basic-income-harms-recipients-and-increases-dependence-government), which means that $ 3,000 in government benefits was required for a net increase in family income of $ 1,000.
1.3.1.1.6. Con: When UBI was tested in [Alaska](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/19/21112570/universal-basic-income-ubi-map), people didn't work any less.
1.3.1.2. Con: Citizens could have an income and still depend on the UBI.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: It is not uncommon for unskilled jobs to be insufficient to [make a living](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/11/21/low-wage-work-is-more-pervasive-than-you-think-and-there-arent-enough-good-jobs-to-go-around/).
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Companies could use the UBI as an excuse to pay less.
1.4. Pro: UBI's help decrease Domestic Violence because victims of Domestic Violence are sometimes dependent on their spouses income. Universal basic incomes would provide ways for victims of Domestic Violence to independently rebuild their lives away from their abusive spouses.
1.4.1. Con: Domestic violence can be tackled in a more targeted and efficient manner. There is no need to pay a UBI to everyone to solve this problem.
1.5. Con: A UBI may erode financial responsibility.
1.5.1. Pro: Bad spending decisions or budgeting would have much less impact.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.7. Pro: Reduces inequality, poverty, and homelessness.
1.7.1. Pro: The UBI would also help to reduce crime.
1.7.1.1. Con: An Alaska [based study](https://iseralaska.org/2019/02/pfd-study-shows-little-impact-on-crime-providing-important-research-on-universal-income/) found that a UBI \(Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend\) has little impact on the crime rate.
1.8. Con: UBIs are restrictions to people's rights. Most of our rights and our power comes form the fact that we work, that we generate and innovate in our private and public functions. If we loose such power, we will loose power to be free.
1.9. Con: UBIs are based on an universal knowledge of what someone needs. It will have to determine what someone is able to buy. Forever, not just as a subsidy or a one-time-off payment. Is it an universal right for someone to have a pool? Ridiculous? A Personal computer? Maybe one per house. Does it have to provide financial stability for a house on a suburb or in the downtown? It is a never ending debate as to what people have the right to.
1.10. Pro: When UBI was tested in [Manitoba, Canada](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/19/21112570/universal-basic-income-ubi-map)(The basic income seemed to benefit residents’ physical and mental health — there was a decline in doctor visits and an 8.5 percent reduction in the rate of hospitalization — and high school graduation rates improved, too.), residents' physical and mental well-being improved.
1.11. Pro: The United States could replace means-tested welfare programs with UBI's.
1.11.1. Pro: May help remove the "poverty trap" from traditional welfare programs.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Many existing social systems are associated with burdens and requirements that must be met in order to qualify for payments.
1.12. Con: The United States simply can't afford to support Universal Basic Incomes.
1.12.1. Con: The government could impose a heavy tax on the rich to fund a UBI.
1.12.2. Con: UBI would generate wealth: "Economists estimate that a universal basic income of 12,000 dollars a year could grow the United States economy by more than 2 trillion dollars a year." [voicesofyouth.org](https://www.voicesofyouth.org/blog/does-united-states-need-universal-basic-income) [rooseveltinstitute.org](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/macroeconomic-effects-universal-basic-income-ubi/)
1.12.3. Con: The UBI plan proposed by the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/budget-neutral-universal-basic-income-plan-would-pay-1320-per-month.html) - $1,320 per month, offset by additional taxation - would be budget neutral.
1.12.4. Pro: In times of high inflation, the UBI would have to be increased in order not to lose its advantages.
