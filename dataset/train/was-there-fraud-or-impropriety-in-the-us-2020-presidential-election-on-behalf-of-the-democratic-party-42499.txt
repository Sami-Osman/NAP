Discussion Name: Was there fraud or impropriety in the US 2020 presidential election on behalf of the Democratic Party?

1. There was voter fraud/impropriety in the US 2020 presidential elections on behalf of the Democratic Party.
1.1. Pro: Republicans claim that the Dominion voting software used [in many states](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-dominion-software-trump-law-idUSKBN27S2Z9) had a glitch [which favoured Biden](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/software-glitch-in-michigan-sent-6000-trump-votes-to-biden/ar-BB1aMk7c).
1.1.1. Con: Michigan's Secretary of State, Jocelyn Benson, clarified that the Michigan "glitch" was due to [human error](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1640_9150-544676--,00.html). It has since been rectified.
1.1.1.1. Con: This "human error" could well have been an intentional attempt to manipulate the results.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: But there is no evidence it was a malicious attempt to manipulate results. Thus, we should be willing to offer the benefit of the doubt.
1.1.2. Con: Some conservative outlets [retracted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/12/21/fox-news-newsmax-walk-back-election-fraud-claims-after-voting-machine-manufacturer-threatens-legal-action/?sh=7034622ccfd2) claims of fraud after being sent legal notices by the manufacturers of voting machines.
1.1.2.1. Con: This does not indicate that their claims are false. They may simply just have wanted to avoid litigation.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: [Anti-SLAPP](https://www.rcfp.org/resources/anti-slapp-laws/#antislappstatestate) laws make it very easy for journalists to defend themselves when sued for defamation. If the plaintiff cannot show evidence that defamation occurred, the case is dismissed, and in many states the plaintiff can be forced to pay the defendant's legal fees. The fact that the outlets retracted their statements without a fight strongly suggests that they knew the voting machine companies had solid evidence that they were spreading false information and would lose an anti-SLAPP motion.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: Truth is an absolute defense against claims of defamation. If the outlets in question have sufficient evidence to indicate that their claims are true -- or merely that they believed those claims to be true -- they need only present that evidence in court for a surefire legal victory. That they have not done so suggests that their claims are unsubstantiated, and potentially defamatory.
1.2. Pro: Without massive voter fraud, Biden could never have won.
1.2.1. Pro: Everyday people are sick of lockdowns, and Biden is in favor of lockdowns \([cf.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52417610)\).
1.2.1.1. Con: "[64% of Americans would support their state instituting a one-month lockdown in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/11/10/americans-support-covid-19-lockdowns)". Since the majority of American voters were likely to support a lockdown, it would make sense for them to vote for Biden.
1.2.1.2. Con: Biden [does not appear to be in favor of lockdowns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/biden-says-he-will-not-order-national-lockdown-to-fight-virus). During a debate, his proposed approach to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic did not deviate meaningfully from Trump's.
1.2.2. Con: In 2016, voter turnout was [56%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/03/in-past-elections-u-s-trailed-most-developed-countries-in-voter-turnout/). Trump received [46%](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2016.pdf) of that vote. This is only 26% of all possible voters. This leaves a wide possibility that the next election could go the other way.
1.2.3. Con: Given how hard the media was on Trump - even deliberately lying and misrepresenting his opinions and goals and those of his supporters - it's entirely possible that the media and the leftists that control so many of our cultural institutions were able to foster sufficient bigotry and hatred against "Trumpism" to manufacture a popular mandate against it that significantly affected the outcome, even without directly cheating at the polls.
1.2.3.1. Con: Leftists do not control many of our cultural institutions.
1.2.4. Pro: Trump's rallies were much bigger than Biden’s.
1.2.4.1. Con: Biden opted for [socially distant drive-in rallies](https://www.news18.com/news/world/both-candidates-agree-donald-trumps-crowds-are-bigger-than-joe-bidens-and-theyre-ok-with-that-3032801.html), due to the coronavirus outbreak, as opposed to Trump who organized mass public rallies. Hence, even though Biden's rallies were smaller, it doesn't necessarily mean that he was less popular than Trump.
1.2.4.2. Con: Bigger turnout at rallies does not necessarily translate to greater votes.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Having bigger turnouts at rallies makes it likelier that one would receive greater support at the ballots.
1.2.4.3. Con: This is because Biden's campaign was predominantly digital.
1.3. Pro: There are numerous statistical anomalies in the voting data.
1.3.1. Con: If this is a reference to the allegation that vote counts violated Benford's Law, there is no expectation that Benford's Law should apply in this case. [Explanation by a mathematician.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etx0k1nLn78)
1.3.2. Pro: Basham, the founding director of the Democracy Institute, claimed several statistical anomalies in voting data. \([foxnews.com](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-donald-trump-patrick-basham-mark-levin)\).
1.3.2.1. Con: Basham has made false claims about his qualifications and experience before, including falsely claiming to [possess a PhD](https://www.bmj.com/content/336/7638/244/rr), thus is a potentially questionable source.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is an argumentum ad hominem; his statements should be assessed independently of his person.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Basham's arguments are largely unevidenced, disputed, and/or opinions, and thus are often backed up only by his self claimed expertise. Therefore it is entirely valid to question both his honesty and expertise.
1.3.2.2. Con: Basham claims that Trump performed better in some metrics or with certain groups, and that proves the election was rigged. In reality though, candidates will often perform better with certain groups but lose an election - due to losing ground elsewhere.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: As an example, the UK's Labour party has performed increasing well with the key demographic of [young/student voters](https://www.fenews.co.uk/fevoices/54861-new-hepi-report-on-students-voters). However it has lost every election since 2005.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: As an example, Obama lost [4%](https://www.pewresearch.org/2008/11/05/inside-obamas-sweeping-victory/) amongst white over 65 voters in 2008, but still ending up with a resounding victory \(overall 4% voteshare gain\).
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Such is the complexity of an election and the amount of potential indicators, that in any dynamic and closely fought race you simply will always be able to find some metrics that make the losing candidate look good. This alone does not constitute evidence of fraud.
1.4. Pro: US officials have lended weight to this claim.
1.4.1. Pro: US Federal Election Commission chairman Trey Trainor said that the [2020 US election is illegitimate due to widespread fraud](https://greatgameindia.com/us-elections-illegitimate/).
1.4.1.1. Con: Election officials said that [there is no evidence of voter fraud or corruption in voting systems](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/13/us-election-officials-say-no-evidence-of-compromised-votes).
1.4.1.2. Con: Trey Trainor is a Republican nominated by Donald Trump and the renewal of his position on the FEC depends entirely on continued Republican support. As such he is hardly an impartial expert.
1.4.2. Con: The official government committees overseeing the election have [stated](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election) that the election was "the most secure in American history."
1.4.3. Con: Most experts and officials in-charge of safeguarding the integrity of elections deny that there was any significant fraud or irregularity.
1.4.3.1. Pro: A coalition of [US federal and state officials](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/13/no-evidence-of-us-election-says-coalition-of-federal-and-state-officials) issued a statement claiming they found no evidence that votes were compromised or altered during the 2020 presidential elections.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The authors of the [statement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/13/no-evidence-of-us-election-says-coalition-of-federal-and-state-officials) included presidents of the National Association of State Election Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State. These bodies are involved in conducting and coordinating the election and therefore their testimony should be considered valuable.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The head of the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54926084) Agency issued a statement expressing confidence in the security and integrity of the elections.
1.4.4. Con: The officials suggested here all had large personal incentives to suggest that there might have been significant fraud, so their testimony is potentially unreliable.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.4.2. Pro: William Barr was appointed by Trump, a Republican and was described as "[Barr made decisions that dovetailed precisely with Mr. Trump’s wishes and the demands of his political allies."](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/william-barr-attorney-general.html) His launching of probe was likely to be a result of these factors rather than an plethora of evidence.
1.4.4.3. Pro: If [78% of people are willing to lie to secure a job](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/19/how-many-job-seekers-lie-on-their-job-application.html), it is not unreasonable to suggest that these two individuals may have been willing to fudge the truth to keep their jobs.
1.4.4.4. Con: This can be said equally of the other side as well. Both sides have personal incentives, both to not lose.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: Only officials that are Republicans and do have such been incentives have been suggested in this branch. Many non-partisans and Republicans, who clearly don't have any personal incentive to admit the Democrats won fairly, still did so.
1.4.4.4.1.1. Pro: [Many Republicans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/11/12/new-hampshire-ohio-governors-are-latest-republicans-to-accept-biden-win--the-full-list/?sh=8cc1f7811e2b) have accepted Biden's victory.
1.4.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump himself has allowed the [transition to Biden's government](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55052640) to take place.
1.4.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Accepting the outcomes of a corrupt election out of respect for the rule of law and the peaceful transition of power, is not an admission that the election was legitimate, or that the transition of power should have occurred. It is nothing more or less than respect for the rule of law - which Trump's enemies claimed for four years that he did not possess.
1.4.4.4.1.1.2. Con: This does not necessitate that there was no fraud/impropriety.
1.4.4.4.1.1.2.1. Con: In any group, you will have some that put party above country, and some that put country above party. If the election was fraudulent, the interests of party and country would align, and all Republicans would say it was fraudulent. If the election was fair and proper, you will still have party-firsters saying it was fraudulent, but country-firsters admitting it was fair and proper.
1.4.4.4.1.1.2.2. Con: It is against Republican's own personal interests to accept a Biden victory. They have a lot to lose by doing so. Yet they have done it anyway.
1.4.4.4.1.1.3. Con: Republicans, like many other people, believe in the rule of the rule of law. Once Congress certified the election, their respect for the rule of law outweighed their belief that fraud occurred.
1.4.5. Pro: The [US attorney](https://www.ft.com/content/231a93c2-62d1-4f8f-9f49-35b235af44fe) general authorized a probe into election fraud. This suggests that there is at least prima facie suspicion about the integrity of the election process and results.
1.4.5.1. Con: [Trump-appointed](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-P-Barr) Attorney General William Barr says [the Justice Department has uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d).
1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.5. Pro: There are issues surrounding mail-in ballots.
1.5.1. Pro: There are numerous stories of mail-in ballots being found in places they shouldn't be \([e.g.](https://www.newsweek.com/absentee-ballots-discarded-kentucky-louisville-dumpster-usps-investigation-1539686), [and](https://wreg.com/news/box-of-mail-absentee-ballots-found-in-wisconsin-ditch/)\).
1.5.1.1. Con: One source offered is of a box of misplaced mail that contained only "several" absentee ballots. Another source is of a dumped box of around 100 ballots which were subsequently delivered. Neither of these offer any reason for serious concern over mail-in voting.
1.5.1.2. Con: These could possibly be honest mistakes.
1.5.2. Pro: Votes were cast on behalf of deceased or non-existent people.
1.5.2.1. Con: [There was a failed attempt to change 8 thousand votes in a jurisdiction of 5.8 million voters.](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-17/hawthorne-men-accused-in-voter-fraud-plot-to-attain-8-000-mail-ballots-for-nonexistent-or-deceased-persons)(The case, he added, highlights how difficult it would be to carry out the widespread voter fraud President Trump and others have claimed was rampant in the 2020 election.\n\n“What this does is it illustrates that election officials here as well as across the country take these issues very seriously. This was 8,000 registrations in a jurisdiction that has 5.8 million voters,” said Logan, noting that the fraud narratives being pushed across the country would have required election officials to fail to notice misconduct on a massively larger scale.) As even such a small-scale attempt was foiled, there is even less reason to think any significant fraud occurred on a larger scale.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: If there was fraud on a much larger scale, people would try to cover it up much better, meaning that it's actually more likely that large scale fraud would be less detectable.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: People would try to cover up election fraud, whether its on a large or small scale, because they would face legal repercussions either way.
1.5.2.2. Pro: In Los Angeles, [two men](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-17/hawthorne-men-accused-in-voter-fraud-plot-to-attain-8-000-mail-ballots-for-nonexistent-or-deceased-persons) tried to register 8,000 mail-in votes of people who were either dead or did not exist.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: The example described is from a local election in the city of Hawthorne, and had no bearing on the presidential election.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: That these men failed in their attempt is evidence that this type of fraud is difficult to pull off and therefore unlikely to occur.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Many ballots in Biden's favor were cast from [invalid locations](https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-february-23). [Alternative link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfN93gDLwVA)
1.5.3. Con: The issues brought up in opposition to mail-in voting are unsubstantiated or overexaggerated.
1.5.3.1. Con: The issues are substantiated and valid.
1.5.4. Pro: The conclusion of a bipartisan 2005 report of the Commission on Federal Election Reform \([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/heed-jimmy-carter-on-the-danger-of-mail-in-voting-11586557667)\) identified absentee ballots as the "largest source of potential voter fraud".
1.5.4.1. Con: Potential voter fraud is not the same as actual voter fraud.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: It does prove that there is a high likelihood of voter fraud.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Electoral fraud is tiny compared to the scale of election votes cast. So even though voter fraud takes up a significant proportion of this it thus remains insignificant.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The mass of an atomic nucleus is far higher than that of an electron, yet both remain insignificant on the scale of everyday objects.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: They are not insignificant at our level though. When together they create larger objects we can weigh. Similarly small amounts of fraud could add up
1.5.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Typical levels of captured voter fraud come out at a mere [0.00006% of votes cast](https://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2020-pandemic-voting-mail-safe-honest-and-fair-stewart). While it might be the most significant source of fraud, actual levels would have to be thousands of times this to amount to anything relevant.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If most were in important districts it could give the smaller number more weight
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: While the source data is limited, it would not appear to suggest this. California despite being heavily lean Democratic \(+14%\) and having a low number of competitive districts - still ends up with a higher number of reports.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Only [14%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index) of California's districts have a CPVI of less than 5%.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: A large portion of this fraud came from Republicans, not Democrats.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: For instance 2 out of the 3 instances exposed in California in 2021 were from confirmed Republicans.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: While it is the most common form, Absentee ballots still form a small fraction \(less than 50%\) of these cases.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.4. Con: The source in this claim is from before the election and it is talking about how safe the future mail in ballots will hypothetically be.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: The [underlying database](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud) is updated past the election, and does not show anything particularly different to the source.
1.5.4.1.1.1.3. Con: If the fraud or impropriety occurred in districts where the race was close, it could have disproportionately large effects even if it were only a small amount
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.1.1.1.2.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.1.
1.7. Pro: There were several allegations of specific fraud.
1.7.1. Pro: Poll watchers were not allowed to properly observe the verification/counting process.
1.7.1.1. Pro: This is because vote counters wanted to commit fraud.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Regardless of intent or reason, this is still a procedural impropriety.
1.7.1.3. Pro: For a period, Philadelphia poll watchers were kept 20-foot away from vote counting \[[CBS](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/11/05/philadelphia-court-decision-poll-watchers-now-allowed-within-6-feet-of-ballot-counting-at-pennsylvania-convention-center/)\].
1.7.2. Pro: Georgia Democratic Senator Warnock is [under investigation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/02/10/georgia-sen-warnock-under-investigation-for-voter-registration-misconduct/?sh=2d04e1e66ea0) for his role serving as board chairman of a voter registration organization founded by Stacey Abrams that election officials say failed to follow deadlines.
1.7.2.1. Con: This investigation doesn't allege any voter fraud, but rather only concerns over missed deadlines.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: A formal allegation requires specific evidence that is difficult to gather - particularly in the moment - and particularly when the political motivations of each side turn the investigation into a partisan issue in which the two sides refuse to work cooperatively. That difficulty in justifying a formal allegation does not negate the fact that the concern over voter fraud associated with missed deadlines for submitting ballots is extremely valid and justified.
1.8. Pro: There were alterations to the process, that while not specific ballot fraud, nonetheless favored Democrats.
1.8.1. Pro: A Nevada state \(which has a Democratic governor\) agency helped fund lottery tickets to encourage Native Americans \(who vote strongly Democratic\) to vote, i.e. a state agency paying Democrats to vote. [reviewjournal.com](https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/opinion-columns/victor-joecks/victor-joecks-nevada-group-offered-gift-cards-for-voting-and-a-state-agency-promoted-it-2187045/)
1.8.2. Pro: Higher voter participation favors Democrats \([fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/increased-voter-turnout-could-benefit-republicans-or-democrats-in-2020/)\). Mail-in voting increases turnout by making it easier to vote. Though increasing ease of voting is not in and of itself a bad thing, this changing of standards constitutes a partisan effort to change the outcome.
1.8.2.1. Con: In this election many people were using mail-in voting for the first time. The added difficulty of setting up and working out how to use a more complicated voting system meant that for the majority of these voters it was not "easier to vote".
1.8.3. Pro: Illegal immigrants are counted in census totals \([census.gov](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment/about/faqs.html\))\) and they tend to live more often in Democratic areas \(e.g. California\). While they don't vote, they do change the number of electors, which is geared to the population. That's not legally fraud, but it is a bias.
1.8.3.1. Con: Historically the census has never asked respondents about their [immigration status](https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-census-asking-citizenship-problem-175053088.html/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACRyp3-PWXZZQ3MIwOKIoPqGaHxOIPMrLxfwm8-8II9xJodphiuMv13iob6_rQMK5_IutYfJDhz1IttiN1ZqCrKRvhv_5n8tAcaGW_CVy_bDgYt7rRIswYhVyDASaNFzfO3gSlUYIY24sb0rMup9qwA4kPPKFOwGVtSH4bUNCkRm) and no changes were recently make by Democrats. Thus the fact that it happens to coincidentally favour Democrats is irrevelant to the 2020 presidental election.
1.8.4. Pro: Democrats tend to vote later with mail-in ballots than Republicans \[[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/27/mail-in-ballot-voting-432913), [NY Mag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/why-do-the-last-votes-counted-skew-democratic.html)\]. Given that there must be a deadline to accept ballots and that the mail itself is unreliable as to delivery date, moving the deadline later favors Democrats. Historically, the absentee-ballot deadline has been election day, but in 2020 Pennsylvania had a court case over how much to extend the deadline after election day for mail-in ballots, an inherently partisan decision \[[WHYY PBS](https://whyy.org/articles/pa-supreme-court-extends-mail-in-ballot-deadlines-to-3-days-after-election-day/)\].
1.8.4.1. Con: A legal change of procedure does not constitute fraud or impropriety.
1.8.4.2. Con: The argument that legally increasing voter turnout is unfair because it disproportionately benefits one party over the other is a tacit admission that one's goal is to suppress expression of the popular will via the democratic process.
1.8.5. Con: As the Republican Party also engages in alterations to the election process, it could be argued that the changes that the Democrats made simply restore a degree of balance, something which is innately [appropriate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appropriateness)/correct/acceptable. Therefore, this behaviour should not be considered [impropriety](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impropriety#synonyms).
1.8.5.1. Pro: Republicans have historically engaged in significantly more Gerrymandering than Democrats, resulting in them gaining a net of [19 seats \(20 - 39 seats shifting\)](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/news/2019/10/01/475166/impact-partisan-gerrymandering/) from 2012-2016.
1.8.5.2. Pro: The Repulicans won a majority in the Electoral College in 2016 despite receiving a [1.1% lower vote share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election). An election that is given to a party that neither achieved a majority nor a [plurality](https://www.britannica.com/topic/plurality-system) could be considered to be both unbalanced and [undemocratic](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/undemocratic).
1.8.6. Con: Many of the issues/alterations raised have existed for decades, so clearly were not part of some 2020 Democratic effort.
1.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.9. Con: Insufficient evidence of electoral fraud has been found.
1.9.1. Con: The changes in election laws Democrats pushed through many state legislatures made the election so vulnerable to fraud, that whatever fraud did occur would have been nearly impossible to detect, investigate or prosecute, especially in time to stop that fraud from affecting the outcomes.
1.9.1.1. Pro: MIT and Caltech did a joint study on election methods after the 2000 election, and determined that mass mail-out ballots to every registered voter is inherently vulnerable to wide-scale fraud, and should be avoided at all costs.
1.9.2. Con: [Hundreds of affidavits](https://hereistheevidence.com/) were signed by witnesses of voter irregularity and fraud.
1.9.2.1. Con: The Republican claim related to ["the 170,830 vote discrepancy in Pennsylvania"](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/pennsylvania-republicans-find-alarming-discrepancy-twice-the-margin-of-biden-s-victory/ar-BB1ckmZm), despite being listed as one of the highest level claims in terms of significance and admissibility, has been thoroughly [debunked](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9887147615).
1.9.3. Pro: [Extensive research](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/debunking-voter-fraud-myth) concerning elections in the past has shown that fraud is extremely rare and insignificant.
1.9.3.1. Con: Overt voter fraud, in the sense of deliberate deceit of identity, is rarely prosecuted. Merely that it is rarely detected is not evidence of actually testing the system to see how common it is.
1.9.3.2. Con: Even if overt legal fraud is rare, the real problem is changing the rules of the game to manipulate which groups get counted more. That does not show up as "fraud" the way the Brennan Center counts things.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: As one example, "Oregon’s New Motor Voter law is registering more young people to vote. " \([sightline.org](https://www.sightline.org/2017/10/09/oregons-new-motor-voter-law-is-registering-more-young-people/)\). Whether that's "fair" or not is hard to say, but the bias is clear \(as young people lean heavily Democratic\) and thus the existing state legislature \(in this case\) has an incentive to change the rules.
1.9.3.2.2. Pro: Would-be Democratic voters are less likely to register than Republican voters. On a near-party line vote, the 117th Congress \(2021\) voted to require all states to permit same-day registration \([section 1031 of HR 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text#toc-H0C72CA940E684A0986583236950CC71E)\). The trade-off between vetting registrations and enfranchisement is complex, but the partisan motivation to change the standards is obvious.
1.9.3.2.3. Pro: Gerrymandering is used by both parties to protect their districts. However, when it is applied to a mostly African-American district, because they vote heavily Democratic, the courts consider it racial and illegal \[[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/)\]. Similar racial demographic considerations do not apply to Democratic gerrymandering. Thus, the incidental correlate of race protects Democratic gerrymandering preferentially.
1.9.3.2.4. Pro: The outcome was influenced in a partisan fashion with money buying preferential access.
1.9.3.2.4.1. Pro: "Bloomberg pays fines for 32,000 felons in Florida so they can vote" \[[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/517522-bloomberg-pays-fines-for-32000-felons-in-florida-so-they-can-vote?fbclid=IwAR3NMGGLJoNvXAVJUJIPhRtdPkqglZYtv3K2_h6X3LyZ93Nxa5yFumGOPA4)\]. Bloomberg is a partisan Democrat and ex-felons typically vote Democratic \[[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/felons-vote-democrat-bernie-sanders-1404728)\].
1.9.3.2.4.2. Pro: In violation of the law, Chicago alderman Leslie Hairston gave people, in his heavily Democratic district, lottery tickets to vote \[[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-leslie-hairston-vote-offer-1030-20141029-story.html?fbclid=IwAR2yPRGuf5AnMMrhDfhSpRB8s-QT3WepNa9XRfy9OyxhL5ymlXdsIFl6ANk)\].
1.9.3.2.5. Pro: Many states allow "ballot harvesting", the conveyance of ballots by third parties, even campaign workers who focus on collecting ballots from a specific demographic \[[OC Register](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/05/17/what-is-ballot-harvesting-and-how-is-it-affecting-southern-california-elections/)\]. While the direct partisan bias is minimal, the invitation to fraud is immense.
1.9.4. Pro: The US election process has robust security mechanisms that successfully prevent fraud and impropriety. Therefore, very little to no evidence of fraud has been found.
1.9.4.1. Con: The Democrats discredited this in claiming that Russia [interfered](https://time.com/5565991/russia-influence-2016-election/) with the 2016 election. If true, then the US' election system cannot be so robust after all.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: This interference being referred to took the form of using social media to sow discord \([Vol 1 pg. 14](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)\), hacking into political campaigns \([Vol 1 pg. 36](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)\), and having ties to Trump campaign officials \([Vol 1 pg. 66](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)\). While this does raise concern about the security of election-adjacent entities, it does not throw doubt on the security of the actual casting and counting of votes, since US intelligence agencies have concluded that [Russia did not directly alter votes in 2016](https://time.com/5565991/russia-influence-2016-election/).
1.9.4.2. Pro: The [mail-in ballots](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/false-narrative-vote-mail-fraud) used during elections have been shown to be safe and secure.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: This study referenced five states with general-mail-in ballots for its conclusion. Those states are not swing states, thus there is no incentive to fraud as it would not have changed the outcome. That's not sufficient evidence that fraud is not possible and would not be attempted where the outcome matters.
1.9.4.2.2. Con: The Brennan Center is a left-wing cause organization\([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennan_Center_for_Justice)\), hardly a reliable source for analyzing a procedural change with partisan implications.
1.9.4.3. Pro: Several [studies](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/truth-about-voter-fraud), including those [commissioned by the Trump administration](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/resources-voter-fraud-claims), have reached the conclusion that allegations of fraud and irregularities during elections are baseless.
1.9.4.4. Pro: States in the US [restrict electioneering](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electioneering.aspx) in the vicinity of the active polling place.
1.9.4.5. Pro: State and federal statutes [prohibit](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nh/pr/federal-election-fraud-fact-sheet) voter intimidation and election malfeasance. These practices trigger harsh criminal penalties and the possibility of [imprisonment.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20511)
1.9.4.5.1. Con: The existence of laws with harsh criminal penalties does not guarantee that these laws shall not be broken.
1.9.4.5.1.1. Con: Harsh criminal penalties act as a deterrent, thereby reducing the frequency of voter intimidation and election malfeasance. Therefore, the existence of such laws reduces the plausibility of claims of fraud and impropriety.
1.9.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Something may generally be improbable, but this general improbability cannot be used to dismiss an individual evidenced claim, which must be evaluated on its own merits.
1.9.4.6. Pro: Voting systems are reliably [tested and certified](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-security-state-policies.aspx) before elections.
1.9.4.7. Pro: [Election workers are trained](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/11/voter-fraud-used-to-be-rampant-now-an-anomaly/) in cybersecurity measures and in the chain of custody rules that safeguard movements of ballots and voting equipment.
1.10. Con: Specific claims of voter fraud made by Trump and his campaign have been rejected or proven to be false.
1.10.1. Pro: Trump's [own lawyers](https://time.com/5914377/donald-trump-no-evidence-fraud/), when standing before judges in their [election lawsuits](https://theconversation.com/why-trumps-election-fraud-claims-arent-showing-up-in-his-lawsuits-challenging-the-results-150505), have often refused to allege fraud and have even explicitly affirmed they have no evidence of fraud.
1.10.1.1. Con: The legal definition of fraud is not the same as the ordinary understanding. For instance, "The Pennsylvania state Supreme Court ruled Friday that ballots in the state cannot be rejected because of signature comparison" \([politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/23/pennsylvania-court-ballot-signatures-431794?fbclid=IwAR3LXraQhrM75M4iBxF-BGYj4SaWMGFWcDwSzkJ4pg34VIcyZdgEaglOG3M)\). That's not legally fraud \(especially since the court blessed it\), but one could view it that way as a cheat.
1.10.2. Pro: Many fraudulent claims about voting machine data, for example - data being stored on foreign servers etc. have been exhaustively debunked. [politifact.com](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/05/mypillow-ceo-lindells-film-not-intended-be-taken-f/)
1.10.3. Con: Trump is given to wild exaggeration. His claims in particular being false do not dispute the legitimate claims of irregularities.
1.10.4. Con: The vast majority of the rejected claims were tossed by judges based on technicalities such as standing and jurisdiction of the courts, rather than tried and decided by juries. This gives advocates claiming fraud occurred a legitimate complaint that their claims were not given due process under the law.
1.10.4.1. Con: Most claims were rejected by the courts because of a [lack of evidence](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-courts-election-idUSKBN2AF1G1).
1.10.5. Con: Most of the accusations have never been adjudicated in a court so cannot be affirmed or denied at this time.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.
1.10.7. Pro: Efforts by Trump's legal team to [challenge election result](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/27/trump-georgia-senate-runoff-election)s in states on the grounds of voter fraud have been repeatedly rejected by courts.
1.10.7.1. Pro: A [federal appeals court in Philadelphia](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-donald-trump-pennsylvania-elections-philadelphia-d9c96c4593ec278f3b1d4bc564068df6?utm_medium=AP_Politics&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow) rejected the effort to challenge the state’s election results on the grounds that it found no merit in the claims offered.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, a Republican, [said](https://apnews.com/article/judge-throws-out-trump-suit-pennsylvania-87eaf4df86d5f6ccc343c3385c9ba86c) the complaint filed by Trump's legal team was filled with errors, and denied the team the right to amend it.
1.10.7.2. Pro: The 3rd Circuit Judge [Stephanos Bibas](https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/203371np.pdf), who was appointed by a Republican president, argued that Trump's legal team offered neither specific allegations nor sufficient proof to substantiate their allegations.
1.10.8. Pro: Trump claimed that there were more votes in Detriot than there were citizens. However, this claim was found to be based on a [human error in reporting](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/25/donald-trump-still-believes-us-election-was), which was later corrected.
1.10.8.1. Con: There were [353 counties](https://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/judicial-watch-voter-roll-study-oct-2020/) in the U.S. that had voter registration rates exceeding 100% of the residents. Michigan was one of those states. This resulted in a total excess registrations of [1.8 Million.](https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/new-jw-study-voter-registration/)
1.10.8.1.1. Con: The data is using numbers over a 5 year period and not showing the population eligible to vote at the time of the election.
1.10.9. Pro: [Twitter](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/trump-tweets-flagged-by-twitter-for-misinformation/) has been fact-checking Trump's tweet containing claims concerning election fraud. This shows that these claims are baseless and are not based on facts.
1.10.9.1. Con: This is because Twitter is biased.
1.10.9.1.1. Pro: Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, [admitted](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/14/17857622/twitter-liberal-employees-conservative-trump-politics) that conservative employees "don’t feel safe to express their opinions" within the company.
1.11. Pro: The media is guilty of intentionally manipulating voter behavior in the elections.
1.11.1. Pro: The widespread censorship of an important story showing Biden’s family under FBI investigation over corruption with the Chinese is proven to have [influenced](https://mclaughlinonline.com/pols/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MA-National-Post-Elect-11-4-20-4.pdf) \(p.17-18\) how people voted. Were it not for this censorship, 7.8% of Biden voters would not have voted for him, which would have resulted in a Trump victory.
1.11.1.1. Con: Such polling is inherently unreliable and never reflects the true behaviour of voters at the ballot. When other results from the question are extrapolated, it is clear that this form of direct analysis is deeply flawed.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: The question suggests for instance that awareness of the evidence would have caused 27% of Conservatives to not participate in the Presidental vote at all. Given that over 80% of Conservatives were aware of the evidence, their turnout should have been extremely low, which runs counter to the evidence of high turnout.
1.11.1.2. Con: The poll suggests that only 0.3% of the electorate would have definitely switched from Biden to Trump. The majority of the remaining individuals are unlikely to actually change their vote in reality.
1.11.1.3. Con: The question, "At the time you cast your vote for president,....which may have personally benefitted Joe Biden Financially?" \(p18\), is not framed from a neutral position, so naturally gives a result biased towards a negative movement against Joe Biden.
1.11.2. Pro: Three days before the election, the press widely [reported that President Trump was down by 17](https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-10-28/biden-opens-gaping-17-point-lead-on-trump-in-wisconsin-poll-finds) points when, in fact, he was either [ahead](https://dailytorch.com/2020/08/trump-surges-ahead-in-battleground-states-michigan-wisconsin-in-trafalgar-poll-does-biden-need-to-get-out-of-his-basement/) or Biden had a narrow advantage. This resulted in a suppression of disillusioned President Trump voters, tipping the results to the opponent.
1.11.2.1. Con: If Democrats being ahead 17 points in the polls was widely believed, then that would naturally encourage Democrat supporters not to vote, as they would feel their votes would no longer be neccessary to win. This increased complacency would likely outway any disillusionment on the Republican side.
1.11.2.1.1. Pro: Voter complacency as a result of polling data and preconcieved notions is a widely cited contributing factor for [Democrats losing the 2016 election](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303163-clintons-new-enemy-complacency).
1.11.3. Pro: The intelligence community intentionally “leaked” an unverified story about Russians paying a ransom to kill Americans in Afghanistan. This was used extensively by a [hostile media](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/cnn-director-shown-on-undercover-video-boasting-about-removing-trump-from-office-and-admitting-to-spreading-propaganda/ar-BB1fCA7W) and the candidates during the campaign. It has now been revealed this story is false. This was fraud and was intended to disrupt the campaign and swing voters.
1.12. Con: Trump's team had [internal polling](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/07/alyssa-farah-q-and-a-456369) that suggested he was likely to lose the election.
1.12.1. Con: Even if the Republicans, by their own polls, predicted that they would lose the election, it does not follow that the voting was free from fraud or impropriety.
1.12.1.1. Pro: In the run up to the election, Republicans were [already alleging voter fraud](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-55009950). Therefore, that their internal polling predicted they would lose may be interpreted as entirely consistent with voter fraud and impropriety.
1.12.2. Con: Partisan polling is [notoriously unreliable](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/22/politics/republican-internal-polling-analysis/index.html).
1.13. Con: Even if some amount of voter fraud or impropriety does exist, it is wrongly presumptive to assume it favoured Democrats or was done deliberately on the Democratic Party's behalf.
1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.
1.13.2. Pro: Most sources of voter fraud could be equally exploited by Democrats and Republicans. Claiming that only the former does so is bigoted.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Proxy voting is equally exploitable for corrupt Democrats and Republicans.
1.14. Pro: Vote count updates were irregular which suggests they were being manipulated.
1.14.1. Con: [Experts argue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/4/us-elections-counting-ballots-is-not-fraud) that taking time to count votes does not indicate that the votes were manipulated.
1.14.1.1. Con: The pauses in vote counting once reinitiated were simultaneous with many other allegations of vote-count irregularities.
1.14.2. Con: Vote count updates have never been entirely regular, let alone during a disruptive event such as a pandemic. It's ridiculous to claim that this means anything.
