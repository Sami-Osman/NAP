Discussion Name: Should the United States attack Iran?

1. The United States should attack Iran.
1.1. Pro: An attack would likely weaken Iran; the region would become more peaceful with a weakened Iran.
1.1.1. Pro: Iran is suspected of developing nuclear weapons.
1.1.1.1. Con: Iran signed the "Iran Nuclear Deal" \([JCPOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action)\) with [inspections](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iran) successfully ensuring uranium enrichment was only for peaceful purposes.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Barack Obama's administration expressed confidence that the JCPOA would prevent Iran from building a nuclear programme in secret. Iran, it said, had committed to "[extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33521655)".
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: "The Iran nuclear deal is the [most comprehensive and restrictive agreement in history](https://www.nti.org/about/iran-deal-working/) - verifiably preventing Iran now and in the future from ever getting a nuclear bomb", according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative \(NTI\), a Non-profit which works to prevent nuclear attacks and accidents.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Iran deliberately breached the terms of the [nuclear deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_nuclear_deal_framework) by exceeding the level of uranium enrichment beyond the negotiated limit, as reported by the [IAEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency) and their government spokespeople. Additionally it announced that it will breach the terms even more, given: ["The Europeans have failed to fulfil their promises of protecting Iran's interests under the deal."](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48784786)
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Iran only \(openly and transparently\) breached the terms of the Nuclear Deal because the US broke the deal in May 2018.
1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump [withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/14/nuclear-deal-trump-america-war) \(JCPOA\), [starting the recent escalation of tensions](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/iran-standoff-timeline-key-events-190622063937627.html).
1.1.1.2. Con: Iran denies the claims, and says it [supports nuclear disarmament](https://web.archive.org/web/20120320101046/http://missions.itu.int/~missiran/sts2007/07031301CD.htm) in the region.
1.1.1.3. Pro: In 2009, some European intelligence claimed Iran has [resumed](http://www.isis-online.org/publications/iran/IAEA_info_3October2009.pdf) its alleged nuclear weapons design work
1.1.1.3.1. Con: The report [stresses in its introduction that its conclusions are tentative](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/world/middleeast/04nuke.html?hp) and subject to further confirmation of the evidence.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: Note the date. 2009, Or in other words, long before the agreement was signed, and over a decade ago.
1.1.1.4. Con: The US has overall found no evidence Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: In 2012, sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was [not attempting to do so](https://notices.californiatimes.com/gdpr/latimes.com/).
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The senior officers of all of the major American intelligence agencies stated that there was [no conclusive evidence](http://www.richardsilverstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Hersh-6-6-11.pdf) that Iran has made any attempt to produce nuclear weapons since 2003
1.1.1.4.3. Pro: In a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the United States Intelligence Community assessed that [Iran had ended all "nuclear weapon design and weaponization work"](http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20071203_release.pdf) in 2003.
1.1.1.5. Con: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said he had seen [no evidence](http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091203/157086953.html) of any nuclear weapons program in Iran.
1.1.1.6. Con: Iran has the right to develop nuclear weapons.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: Iran is still a [signatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#Iran) of the Non Proliferation Treaty that prohibits it from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons.
1.1.2. Pro: Iran is [supporting militias and insurgencies](https://www.csis.org/war-by-proxy) in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen that destabilize the region and hurt American interests.
1.1.3. Con: The same argument was used against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan, yet the efforts to get rid of them made the region less stable and peaceful.
1.1.3.1. Pro: President Bush [argued in March 2003](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/18/usa.iraq) that "there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors" once Iraq has been taken care of, implying that this would pacify the region.
1.1.3.2. Pro: President Bush's speech in 2001 prior to the invasion of Afghanistan directly referenced the threat that the Taliban regime poses to the wider region.
1.2. Con: The US has a poor track record with similar attacks in the Middle East.
1.2.1. Pro: Historically, and with American interests in mind, US-led interventions into the affairs of other countries have not ended well.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The Vietnam War left 58,000 American soldiers dead and a further 300,000 wounded, and it achieved none of its war aims.
1.2.1.2. Con: This does not mean that this trend inevitably continues into the future. Lessons can be learned.
1.2.2. Con: There are examples for targeted military attacks by American forces in the region that were successful.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The military intervention of NATO forces in Libya, among them the US, in 2011 left the country [better off](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success) than it was before.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: NATO does [not support](https://www.apnews.com/d543b2bb12fb4615ae8acfcedd2b6444) a US attack on Iran.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that the involvement of NATO allies would make a difference. The intervention in Libya was [driven, primarily, by the US](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/0702/Can-Europe-shoulder-its-military-burden-on-its-own).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: The intervention in Libya had a clear goal: [the prevention of mass atrocities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/libya-intervention-shows-shift-in-thinking-about-mass-atrocities/2011/04/01/AFTI2wJC_story.html). This clear objective is missing in the case of any attack on Iran.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: Regardless of the success of US intervention, [Libya continues to be in a state of civil war and instability.](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-libya)
1.2.3. Pro: No matter whom the US fights, they are always considered a foreign oppressive force in the region and generally despised for it by all countries in the region.
1.2.3.1. Pro: During the second Iraq war, the US had to close long-held bases in [Saudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_Saudi_Arabia) [Arabia](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2984547.stm), as there was domestic opposition to the US staging war from the holy land onto another Muslim people.
1.3. Con: International sanctions and agreements are a better way to address the issues.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.3.2. Con: Sanctions have been ineffective elsewhere, especially with an eye on preventing countries from developing nuclear weapons.
1.3.2.1. Pro: North Korea has been under [increasingly comprehensive and strict sanctions](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron) for decades yet has developed nuclear weapons and the technology to deliver them.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: North Korea is a special case since it has a super power - in this case [China](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/four-reasons-why-china-supports-north-korea) - propping it up. Iran doesn't have that.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Even during times when North Korea was being universally condemned, China [reacted sluggishly](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fg-china-north-korea-sanctions-2018-story.html) to their applying sanctions.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: A similar argument could be made for Iran with an eye on its [close relationship](https://www.mei.edu/publications/iran-russia-ties-never-better-maybe-not-forever) with Russia.
1.4. Con: The sovereignty of all states, including Iran, should be respected.
1.5. Con: An attack should be the last resort in response to an Iranian attack.
1.6. Pro: Iran presents a threat to America and its allies.
1.7. Pro: The US would benefit from a war with Iran.
1.7.1. Con: Attacking a foreign country for your own benefit is an immoral act.
1.7.1.1. Con: Just because an attack is immoral by some standards does not mean that it wouldn't benefit the US.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.7.3. Con: Trump did not abandon the deal with the national interest in mind, but because Obama [supported](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7244539/Trump-axed-Iran-deal-spite-Obama-British-ambassador-says-Trumps-actions-diplomatic-vandalism.html) it. If it would have been beneficial for the US to go to war with Iran, good reasons would have been communicated for it, but this has not happened.
1.7.3.1. Pro: A president annulling treaties of past presidents, for personal reasons, is not beneficial for the US.
1.7.4. Pro: The American arms industry would profit.
1.7.4.1. Pro: When the US fired some 66 cruise missiles on targets in Syria, this cost [around $92 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/16/syria-airstrikes-cost-to-us-taxpayers.html). This money, at least to some part, went to the American arms industry.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: There are arguably much better uses for that money, especially with the current state of the world and the US economy.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The US aerospace and defense industry provides [about 3.5 million jobs](https://siteselection.com/issues/2012/sep/sas-military-economy.cfm).
1.7.5. Pro: It has been a long-standing American foreign policy interest to keep Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. An attack would set back these efforts on the Iranian side.
1.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.7.6. Con: US interests in the region are not worth supporting. The United States is behaving as an imperialist aggressor to a nation it [formerly controlled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) as a [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi). War would be costly in Iranian lives and unlikely to bring stability or positive change to the country.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Iraq continues to be massively unstable following US intervention, well-known to have rampant corruption and multiple terrorist militant groups within its territory.
1.8. Pro: US allies would benefit from a war with Iran.
1.8.1. Pro: Israel would benefit from an American attack on Iran.
1.8.1.1. Con: Further tensions in the region \(or even an escalation\) are hardly in the interest of Israel, a country that already faces several enemies in its neighborhood.
1.8.1.2. Pro: The US considers itself the protector of Israel and Iran is Israel's number one public enemy, with many Iranian public leaders declaring the intention to undo Israel.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Iran supports Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon, the main close proximity enemy of Israel.
1.8.2. Con: Benefits for American allies can be a convenient side-effect of decisions, but they should not determine them. American interests should determine decisions.
1.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.
1.8.2.2. Pro: This approach was [summed up](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger#1980s) by Henry Kissinger: "America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests."
1.8.3. Pro: Saudi Arabia would greatly benefit from a war between the US and Iran.
1.8.3.1. Con: Saudi Arabia is a signifigant human rights violator - the US should not act to benefit them.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia has [terrible human rights for women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia).
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: Saudi Arabia [killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fnews%2fwonk%2fwp%2f2015%2f09%2f28%2fwhy-one-of-the-worlds-worst-human-rights-offenders-is-leading-a-un-human-rights-panel%2f%3futm_term%3d.0632df46eb39&utm_term=.ea70085811af) journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its embassy, sentenced a blogger to 1000 lashes for writing about free speech and has sentenced a 17 year old Arab Spring protester to beheading and crucifixion.
1.8.3.1.3. Pro: Saudi Arabia hires a major PR firm, accused of "[whitewashing serious human rights abuses](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/pr-firm-accused-of-helping-saudi-arabia-whitewash-its-human-rights-record-a6937271.html)".
1.8.3.2. Pro: The US would most probably win and denuclearize the country completely.
1.8.3.3. Pro: Iran has always been the Saudis' arch enemy.
1.8.3.3.1. Pro: The Iranians are engaging in a quasi proxy war with the Saudis by supporting Yemenite forces that are fighting Saudi-supported forces. These Yemenite forces even attack facilities in Saudi Arabian with [missiles](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/12/middleeast/saudi-airport-houthi-missile-intl/index.html).
1.8.3.3.2. Pro: Iranians are Shiites and thus considered heretics by Sunnis like the Saudis.
1.8.3.3.2.1. Pro: Saudi Arabia considers itself to be the preserver and enforcers of the correct Islam, namely [Wahhabism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism) an even stricter interpretation of Sunni Islam.
1.8.3.4. Pro: The US [supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia%E2%80%93United_States_relations) Saudi Arabia, and has a strong trade realtionship including energy, oil, and US supplied weapons.
1.9. Con: The Iranian people would suffer as a result of US military aggression against their nation.
1.9.1. Pro: The US's increasing use of drone strikes causes civilian deaths.
1.9.1.1. Pro: US transparency on civilian deaths as a result of covert air strikes outside official war zones has been recently [reduced](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-03-07/trump-tells-cia-dont-tell-world-about-dead-civilians).
1.9.1.2. Pro: The New American report claims that between 2006 and 2009, [31 to 33 percent of people killed by US drone strikes were civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAVs_in_the_U.S._military#Use_in_the_%22War_on_Terror%22).
1.9.1.3. Con: There is [considerable evidence](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26298539?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) that the number of civilians killed by US drone strikes has been declining, for example due to improved tracking technologies and procedures.
1.9.2. Con: This is only fair since they are at least co-responsible for the actions of their government.
1.9.2.1. Con: The regime in Iran is [undemocratic](https://web.archive.org/web/20180504005559/http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/no-iran-not-democracy), so civilians have little say in the actions of the government.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Iran [frequently persecutes and arrests critics of the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran#Government_and_politics) and its Supreme Leader, and severely restricts the participation of candidates in popular elections as well as other forms of political activity.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: Civilians can still make their voices heard, for example through protests against the government line.
1.9.2.2. Con: This kind of mentality can easily devolve into justifying the mass killings of civilians based on the actions of their government and military.
1.9.3. Pro: This is likely to further deepen and solidify antipathy towards the US, thus making a permanent solution of any conflict between Iran and the US only more difficult.
1.10. Pro: The US claims Iran has planned, supported, and made attacks against US forces and interests.
1.10.1. Pro: On 20 June, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [shot down a US surveillance drone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Iranian_shoot-down_of_American_drone).
1.10.1.1. Con: Iran claims the drone was invading their airspace.
1.10.2. Con: [Allies in Europe and the region are skeptical](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html?module=inline) given the history of [faulty intelligence that led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/washington/05cnd-intel.html?module=inline), led by the United States.
1.10.2.1. Con: Events, mistakes and lies from more than a decade ago and committed by a completely different cast of actors should not be used as a guide for contemporary decision making.
1.10.3. Con: The US has historically been the aggressor against Iran.
1.10.3.1. Pro: America accidentally [shot down an Iranian passenger jet](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/07/anniversary-iran-air-655-us-diplomacy.html), killing 290 people.
1.10.3.2. Pro: The 1988 US [Operation Preying Mantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Praying_Mantis) sunk half of Iran's operational fleet, which the International Court of Justice ruled was not justified.
1.10.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.10.3.4. Pro: In 2011 Iran [captured a US drone](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1209/Downed-US-drone-How-Iran-caught-the-beast) invading their airspace.
1.10.3.5. Pro: Donald trump is threatening and agressive against Iran.
1.10.3.5.1. Pro: Donald Trump [regularly](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1143529903238893568?lang=en) [threatens](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1021234525626609666?lang=en) [obliterating](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1143529907403788288)/[ending](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1130207891049332737) Iran on twitter.
1.10.3.6. Pro: In 1953 U.S. and British intelligence agencies helped elements in the Iranian military [overthrow Iran’s democratically elected prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#United_States'_role), Mohammed Mossadeq, to [retain control over the regions oil](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/690363402/how-the-cia-overthrew-irans-democracy-in-four-days?t=1647965070147).
1.10.4. Pro: Iran has attacked ships in the Gulf of Oman.
1.10.4.1. Pro: In may 2019, Iran has been blamed for [attacking four commercial ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2019_Gulf_of_Oman_incident).
1.10.4.2. Pro: Iran, allegedly, [attacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2019_Gulf_of_Oman_incident) two oil tankers in June 2019 near the Strait of Hormuz.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: The UAE along with Saudi Arabia and Norway presented findings to the UN showing "[no evidence had been presented linking Iran to the attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/uae-tanker-attacks-un-iran-norway-saudi-arabia)", instead blaming an "unidentified state actor".
1.10.4.2.2. Pro: The U.S. released a video of an Iranian ship removing a mine from the tanker's hull.
1.10.4.2.2.1. Con: The ships were attacked off the coast of Iran, it makes sense for the Iranian coastguard to respond.
1.10.4.2.2.2. Con: The US has a poor track record of honesty regarding marine events which might lead to war. We should not believe the US government's version of events.
1.10.4.2.2.3. Con: The Iranian's would strike at night and would remove unexploded mines at night too.
1.10.4.2.2.3.1. Con: Iran might very well execute such a mission during daylight, in order to provoke the US.
1.10.4.2.2.3.1.1. Con: But then Iran would not deny the allegations that they were involved.
1.10.4.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.10.4.2.2.4. Con: If you wanted to clandestinely remove an undetonated mine, you would do this with a dive team, not with a bright white speed boat in broad daylight.
1.10.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: Limpet mines are magnetic, and can be manually attached at any height.
1.10.4.2.2.4.2. Pro: The attacked ships are not moving and thus very easy to get to for divers.
1.10.4.2.2.5. Con: Video evidence is not reliable these days anymore, if we can faceswap close up faces, we can create grainy footage of a ship with a couple of people on them doing something close to the hull of a ship.
1.10.4.2.2.6. Pro: Photographs and video published by Iran’s Press TV network show the [same type of patrol boats](https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/03/10/454973/Iran-IRGC-Fadavi-Ashoura-Zolfaqar) as part of a ceremony marking the delivery of such vessels to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
1.10.4.2.2.6.1. Con: The ships were attacked off the coast of Iran, it makes sense for the Iranian coastguard to respond.
1.10.4.2.2.7. Con: While the object on the side of the Kokuka Courageous is described as a “likely limpet mine”, the images presented aren’t clear enough to verify that, or that the mine is Iranian issue.
1.10.4.2.2.8. Con: An Iranian made boat could be crewed by anyone, there is no reason to believe it belonged to the Iranian government.
1.10.4.2.2.9. Con: The Japanese company that owns the tank said they [saw ‘flying objects’ before the explosion, denying the ship struck a mine](https://www.rt.com/news/461845-kokuka-owner-rejects-mine-attack/).
1.10.4.2.2.9.1. Pro: Eye witnesses by the crew members of the oil tanker have said it was caused by a falling object.
1.10.4.3. Con: It is unlikely that Iran is behind these attacks.
1.10.4.3.1. Con: Iran has a long standing rivalry with Saudi Arabia and these attacks could serve to affect trade in the region the Saudis depend on.
1.10.4.3.2. Con: The Iranian Government would benefit from increasing the price of oil.
1.10.4.3.2.1. Con: As a result of sanctions, Iran's oil exports have [declined to a level](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRNNXGOCMBD) at which even a higher oil price would hardly be able to have a significant effect on Iran's overall situation.
1.10.4.3.2.2. Pro: Approximately [20%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz#Oil_trade_flow) of the worlds oil trade is shipped via the Straight of Hormuz, thus its disruption will lead to shortages and a huge spike in oil prices.
1.10.4.3.2.3. Pro: The Iranian Government is an oil-rich country which benefits from high prices.
1.10.4.3.2.3.1. Con: Iran has suffered countless sanctions from the US and their allies, and such actions are likely to lead to even more sanctions, negating if not completely reversing the gains from temporarily spiking oil prices.
1.10.4.3.3. Con: False flag attacks on ships have been used in both WW1 and Vietnam \(Gulf of Tonkin\). It is not out of the realm of reasonable suspicion that it could happen again.
1.10.4.3.4. Con: Iran has repeatedly [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-oil-exports/iran-says-ready-for-u-s-waivers-end-as-guards-threaten-to-shut-hormuz-idUSKCN1RY0MK) implicitly and explicitly that the Straight of Hormuz would become impassable in the case of aggression. Getting this point across by demonstrating it and having the world witnessing the effects would make sense for them.
1.10.4.3.4.1. Con: Iran has neither the military capability, nor the domestic stability to wage a war of aggression or sustained military blockade of the Strait.
1.10.4.3.4.2. Con: Iran does not need to demonstrate this, it is clear to any military and political analyst.
1.10.4.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.3.2.2.
1.10.4.3.5. Pro: The Iranian Government would not risk a war with the U.S.
1.10.4.3.5.1. Con: Iran has seen the US get bogged down in multiple wars across the Middle East with little gain. Even if it's a potentially suicidal move on the part of their government, they could view dragging the US into yet another protracted conflict as worth the risk.
1.10.4.3.5.2. Con: Iran may have calculated that the attack on the tankers would under no circumstances lead to a war with the US.
1.10.4.3.5.3. Con: A war against the US would unite Iranians and would thus be of great domestic political value.
1.10.4.3.5.3.1. Con: There isn't much value to Iranians being united if the nation is conquered by foreign powers.
1.10.4.3.5.4. Pro: Iran is likely to lose a war with the U.S.
1.10.4.3.5.4.1. Con: Iran could negotiate with other countries and build a stronger alliance of nations.
1.10.4.3.5.4.1.1. Con: Almost every state Iran borders is allied to the US and hostile to Iran in some form, and the ones that aren't do not possess the strength to pursue a full war against the US and their regional allies. This would not be a viable strategy, and Iran, having been in this situation for decades, likely knows this.
1.10.5. Pro: The US [destroyed a drone](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49040415) threatening the USS Boxer. The US claims the Iranian drone approached the USS Boxer ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship's crew.
1.10.5.1. Con: Iran [denies](https://twitter.com/araghchi/status/1152081448704196611) any drone was destroyed.
1.10.6. Pro: Israel's Mossad intelligence agency warned the United States about a possible [plot by Iran to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf](https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/05/08/israel-warned-us-about-possible-iranian-attack-in-gulf-report/).
1.10.6.1. Con: Given their mutual history, any claims Mossad or Israel make about Iran should be taken with at least some suspicion. At any rate, it was only a possible attack. A nation having a possible plan to attack something is no reason to go to war, much less invade.
