Discussion Name: Is Conflict Between Groups Inevitable?

1. Conflict between groups is inevitable.
1.1. Con: Organizations like the United Nations exist to prevent and manage conflicts.
1.1.1. Pro: [UN peacekeeping forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_peacekeeping) are deployed in conflict-zones to maintain order and security.
1.1.2. Con: Many conflicts have taken place since the existence of the United Nations.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Countries have bypassed the UN to pursue their vested interested.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The United States was able to launch a war against Iraq without the [approval](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq) of the United Nations.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The United Nations has sanctioned military interventions in countries that have caused destruction.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Estimates of deaths in the Libyan Civil War, sanctioned by the UN, vary with figures from [2,500 to 25,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_2011_Libyan_Civil_War) given between March 2 and October 2, 2011.
1.2. Con: A need for conflict only arises as a function of competing individual interests in a particular ecology. If we manage to change our need for competing interests we may be able to eradicate conflict, and this is proving itself now: war has been steadily declining over the last 500 years \(Pinker, 2011\).
1.2.1. Pro: Nearly all forms of violence have [declined](https://slides.ourworldindata.org/war-and-violence/#/3) over human history.
1.2.2. Con: This is predicated on the assumption that there is a need \(for competing interests\) that is changeable. Possibly, however, it is not a need, but as individuals \(and societies\) are geared towards different values, and as they consist of differing personalities \(which may not be managed or altered easily\), differing preferences - and thus, interests - will always prevail.
1.3. Pro: Conflict prompts change. Such conflict does not have to be violent or undesirable; peaceful ways of resolving conflicts can equally lead to enhancement of potential, discovering new resources and better understanding of the self and others.
1.3.1. Pro: Often, progress requires a synthesis of ideas. A synthesis of ideas is the outcome of two opposing concepts formed into one product \(neither the same as the previous concepts or entirely different\). Often the two opposing concepts are accompanied/ owned by respective groups of individuals. In such cases a synthesis can sometimes only be reached after conflict.
1.3.2. Pro: Once we are in conflict with each other, we interact with each other and are given a chance to voice our concerns and express our interests - thus making us both better off as we know each other better and may end the conflict in the first place once we have expressed our concerns.
1.4. Con: Conflict, historically, has been a prominent means of securing wealth; economic power was limited to natural resources, hence conquering land was vital. This is no longer the case.
1.4.1. Con: Conflict doesn't only yield profit. Conflict can stimulate technological research \(such as found in the Cold War\) which would otherwise not have been readily available. Technology serves the needs of humanity in many ways. Technological progress could be seen as 'needing' conflict.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Indeed, citizens of the United States have not doubted the necessity of moon travel when the Soviets made claims about such a project during the Cold War. Now it is seen as expensive \(although the budget of all of NASA is [a mere 0.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA) of the federal budget\)
1.4.1.2. Con: Some aspects of scientific progress may be accelerated by conflict, but it does not necessarily follow that conflict is therefore 'needed'.
1.4.1.3. Con: Conflict is just one way to accelerate scientific progress. Another driver is a competitive market: the competition for \(financial\) resources in an open competence hierarchy.
1.4.2. Pro: Our present economy depends instead on service and production industries; as such, wealth is not limited by land, but grows indefinitely. War is therefore unprofitable and ultimately pointless.
1.4.3. Pro: Historic lessons of violence are not applicable today because of a change in technology and society.
1.4.3.1. Con: Yet thus far, there has been no cessation of conflict.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The invention of the nuclear bomb helped to foster peace among the major powers during the Cold War.
1.4.4. Con: Some natural resources are still scarce or subject to dispute today in some regions \(e.g. water, oil, food, rare earths\), and securing them still offers substantial benefits \(e.g. survival, profit\).
1.5. Pro: According to the Moral Foundations Theory, biological evolution has produced various group-related psychological modules in individuals that are blueprints for preferences in moral questions that underlie many conflict issues and most social psychological phenomena related to conflict \(e.g. in-group bias, groupthink, etc.\).
1.6. Pro: The 20th century has seen the most extreme rise in both economic abundance and war-related deaths. Attempted utopias have historically produced more death and destruction for the populations they were destined for than peace and prosperity \(Marxism, Nazism\).
1.6.1. Con: This doesn't mean that it's necessary, only that it has happened.
1.6.2. Con: This seems more a response to modern developments than anything else; this doesn't mean conflict is necessary.
1.7. Pro: Evolution is propelled by competition for limited resources. Scarcity is what allows both human and nonhuman life to seek new solutions and grow.
1.7.1. Con: The Western world appears sociologically beyond natural selection. Survival is not determined by classical evolutionary markers like strength or intelligence, but by sufficient wealth, now often even provided at a state level. Yet we continue needing to solve [endless new problems](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2017/11/30/why-the-world-is-getting-better-why-hardly-anyone-knows-it/#37ad2c387826). This may be because scarcity is the problem being solved, hence it is losing its importance.
1.7.2. Pro: Conflict is a fundamental law of survival, since the cavemen and when the first human empires rose. Today, conflict rises from opinions and ideologies and it evolves into economical and political warfare. It is part of our instinct to attack other in order to gain or protect something. Simply put: it is just human nature.
1.7.3. Pro: There is no historical indication of a link between abundance and social harmony. Outside the sphere of politics and the history of civilizations there is no way to assess degrees of abundance. Inside the same sphere the highest points of abundance were reached by the most advanced military powers in a certain place and time.
1.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.7.3.2. Pro: This is evidenced in the Roman Empire, the Aztec Empire, British Empire, the USA, et cetera.
1.7.4. Con: Recent scientific and technological advancements change the ontological status of scarcity itself. In a different social and economic paradigm where these advancements would be uniformly dispersed - there would be no scarcity.
1.7.4.1. Con: Conflict is not based on scarcity alone. Eliminating scarcity would not necessarily eliminate all conflict.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Such advancements include 3D printers, nanotechnology, information technologies and genetic engineering.
1.8. Con: Societies are aging. They will not be able to wage war against each other as effectively.
1.8.1. Con: Conflict and war are two different things.
1.8.2. Pro: [Sheen Seong-ho](http://as.ucpress.edu/content/53/2/292) argues that the aging societies in East Asia cause a 'demographic peace'.
1.8.3. Con: The future of war is not in the vigour of standing armies. Drones, guided missiles and automated assault/defence units are already starting to prove that the boots on the ground are not as essential to armed conflict as in the past.
1.9. Pro: Cultures and heritage which conflict with one another no matter how much time in history passes.\(Muslims vs Christians. blacks vs white\) Western Civilisations core principles of democracy, liberty and freedom under a Republic have changed very little from the Romans and Greeks and yet people still challenge there is a "utopian way", a "better way" \(socialism, communism, social-democracy\). We will always have Optimists, Pessimists and Realists. their very nature drives inevitable conflict.
1.9.1. Con: This is the crux of this discussion every point in it, as examples are either based on superstition or a populist form of accepted ignorance. As long as we ascribe to this belief there can be NO open honest dialog. The best example is "Islam vs Christian". Both the Gospel\(fr. N.T.\) & Qur`an refute that. Ignorance of each other's books give us fear & paranoia generating hatred.
1.10. Pro: To suggest that conflicts can always be avoided, is to say that all positions can be reconciled with each other. In other words, that is to claim that all disagreements are born from misunderstandings, and not from deep logical or material exclusions. While such a total position cannot be disproved on a strict philosophical level, it seems outlandish enough to be considered untrue.
1.10.1. Pro: Opinion polarization [\(def.\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_\(politics\)) is inherent in humans, and this drives conflict.
1.10.1.1. Pro: The attainment of ideologies or religions seem to occur repeatedly in human civilisations, even when seeming disparate.
1.10.1.2. Pro: The development of polarisation is dangerous, as it generates a focus on differences rather than potential similarities, further driving conflict.
1.10.1.3. Con: As long as we place more value in opinions than facts, polarization will remain. However, once the scale starts tipping in favor of facts, conflict should decrease, because one can't argue about broadly accepted facts.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: You cannot derive decisions about future events from facts \(as they obviously have to be about the unknown, and thus, value-driven\) nor are most established \(scientific\) theories \(i.e. "facts"\) undisputed.
1.11. Con: Only ignorance allows conflict to happen, when people disagree and fail to find a common ground were both can grow and flourish, conflict happens. And this can be about a piece of land or some belief [or religion.](https://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en/wisdom/video/why-religion-and-conflict)
1.11.1. Con: There are cases where you may be completely non-ignorant \(i.e. very well informed about\) and totally aware of the needs and interests of the other party, but their interests and needs are diametrically opposed to your own. If the stakes are high in such zero-sum "games" \(i.e. it is either the other party or you\), rivalry, competition and conflict is likely to occur despite all parties taking cognizance.
1.12. Con: Power as expressed through violence is nearing a zenith. Technological advances will soon produce an environment where fighting the victor is impossible. Any attempt to take up arms will in essence become a form of suicide, causing the traditional motivations for conflict to become meaningless.
1.12.1. Con: There are different forms of conflict, not just violent ones \(e.g. cold war\). Also, essentially, conflicting parties may not aim at victory or defeat but, rather, survival.
1.13. Pro: Population growth puts pressure onto communities to expand their borders .[fightaging.org](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1/)
1.13.1. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.13.3. Con: This is the so-called [Lebensraum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum) argument the Nazis used to reason their way to the Holocaust. However, it remains simply wrong - e.g., the number of wars has decreased over the last centuries worldwide despite the immense [population growth](https://humanprogress.org/dwline?p=281&yf=1950&yl=2015&high=0&reg=1&reg1=0) rates, and both [hunger](https://humanprogress.org/article.php?p=354) and [poverty rates](https://humanprogress.org/dwworld?p=97&yf=1977&yl=2016&col=1) have also decreased significantly.
1.14. Con: The question seems flawed. Conflict between groups provides the context for cooperation within groups, and vice versa. Groups cannot conflict unless the members see themselves as members of that group. So, if conflict is inevitable, so too is co-operation.
