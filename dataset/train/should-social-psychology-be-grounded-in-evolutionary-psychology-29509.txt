Discussion Name: Should social psychology be grounded in evolutionary psychology?

1. Social psychology should be grounded in evolutionary psychology.
1.1. Pro: Grounding social psychology in evolutionary psychology could improve society.
1.1.1. Con: Grounding social psychology in evolutionary psychology should not be guided by the practical implications of doing so, no matter how positive.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Applying evolutionary psychology to social psychology, strictly for pragmatic or political purposes, risks reducing both to a dressed-up style of policy-making rather than respectable scientific disciplines.
1.1.2. Pro: Offers the potential for more objective approaches to criminal justice and rehabilitation.
1.1.2.1. Con: The [prison-industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex) is such that it is unlikely to allow any research that goes against its vested interests to be published or utilized.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Private prison companies [routinely lobby](http://www.justicepolicy.org/news/2615) Congress for lengthier prison sentences.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: A number of industries make steep profits off of the current justice system.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The prison phone industry earns an estimated [$1.2 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/us/steep-costs-of-inmate-phone-calls-are-under-scrutiny.html) per year.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Corizon Health is the US's largest prison health-care firm. It treats more than three hundred thousand prisoners nationwide, earning about [$1.4 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/why-are-prisoners-dying-in-county-jail-) in annual revenue
1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit criminal-justice think tank, estimates that commissary companies earn [$1.6 billion](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2016/07/05/commissary-merger/) per year.
1.1.3. Pro: Uncover lesser known angles of social manipulation and take them off of the table for misuse.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The more people are aware of ways in which they can be socially manipulated, the more likely they are to notice when it happens and resist it.
1.1.3.2. Con: Many angles of social manipulation, such as in advertising, have already been uncovered. These are still actively used in the world despite their harms.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Various psychological concepts are [used in advertising](http://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&context=shas_honors) to sell products more effectively \(p. 4\).
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Collectively, the top 200 advertisers in the US spent a record [$163 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/10-biggest-advertising-spenders-in-the-us-2015-7) on advertising in 2018, with no legal ramifications.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: [Skinnerian Marketing](https://behavioralscientist.org/21st-century-skinner-box/) is a well-understood norm that is utilized in emerging technologies and techniques and will increasingly allow companies to exploit consumersâ€™ irrationality or vulnerability.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: An [experiment](https://behavioralscientist.org/21st-century-skinner-box/) found that utilizing this technique could allow for the proportion of undecided voters who indicated that they would vote for a given candidate could be shifted by 37.1%, with shifts as high as 80% occurring in some demographic groups.
1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple have all made [extensive use](https://behavioralscientist.org/21st-century-skinner-box/) of Skinnerian Marketing in order to sell their products.
1.2. Con: The claims of evolutionary psychology are difficult to verify.
1.2.1. Pro: Without the ability to test ancestors throughout our evolutionary timeline, we lack a solid baseline to test against.
1.2.1.1. Con: Historical approaches are not the only tool and by themselves would be considered highly speculative. Evolutionary game theory and watching it play out both in recent history and in the current moment gives us a grounding where P values can be established.
1.2.2. Con: Evolutionary psychology is backed up by a number of evidence sources. Anthropological studies show that certain traits are common for all human beings. Archaeological studies give us evidence about life in the ancestral environment. Modern psychological studies give us evidence about the modern mind. An evolutionary psychology theory makes predictions that should be proven to be true in these diverse fields.
1.2.3. Con: Difficult is a subjective term. It is often difficult to prove a mathematical Truth, but that is not a measure of either utility nor accuracy. Whether or not something is difficult to prove is insufficient argument to kicking it to the curb
1.2.4. Pro: Evolutionary explanations for social psychology are typically [speculative](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-fallacies-of-pop-evolutionary-2012-12-07/), and therefore scientifically unsound.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Many evolutionists use [plausibility and consistency](https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/GouldLewontin.pdf) with natural selection as the only criterion for advancing an evolutionary explanation for a human behaviour \(p. 7\). This is an extremely low bar for empirical investigation.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Identifying the plausibility and consistency of a given explanation with existing theory is a good approach to constructing scientific hypotheses. However, it is a wholly insufficient reason to change the entire grounding of a scientific discipline.
1.3. Pro: Evolutionary psychology is the most persuasive insight into human nature. Just as we can understand other animals' behaviour by understanding them as beings that evolved, so to can we best understand human behaviour through the evolutionary lens. This understanding of human nature is essential for all of psychology and the other social sciences.
1.4. Con: Evolution might have emerged from dynamics identified in game theory. Therefore, game theory and not social psychology, better explain evolutionary psychology.
1.4.1. Con: Game theory is nothing more than the mathematical expression of a central tension in human evolution: individualism versus cooperation. Since they are indistinguishable, they do not give rise to the chicken-or-egg problem.
1.4.2. Con: Evolutionary psychology can still have explanatory value even if the causal relationship is unclear.
1.4.3. Pro: Policy-level scope creep and institutional over-reliance on game theory as a shortcut or research substitute could lead to progressive bleaching of democracy. Countermeasures may be needed to prevent this.
1.5. Pro: Offers insight into subconscious processes in culture and human decision-making.
1.5.1. Pro: Cultural differences are often reflected in the brain.
1.5.1.1. Con: The fact cultural differences are reflected in the brain does not say anything about the direction of causation i.e. whether cultural differences change the brain or vice versa. Yet the direction of causation is crucial to evolutionary psychology, which says our biology causes cultural differences.
1.5.1.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747168) found that people with high-dopamine variants showed significantly stronger cultural differences than low-dopamine types.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Researchers [studied](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110411163922.htm) the brain waves of people with Caucasian and Asian backgrounds and found that cultural differences in how we think about other people are embedded deep in our minds.
1.5.2. Pro: Recognizing and understanding such processes will mean that we can take better advantage of them by consciously using them to direct our decisions.
1.6. Pro: Our evolution depends on escaping evolution. Only through truly understanding our evolutionary pathology can we overcome it.
1.6.1. Pro: Potential for predicting and preventing social breakdown.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Certain trends and patterns in behavior may be uncovered.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: These patterns could be used to pre-empt destructive behaviours and crimes, which could create a safer environment.
1.6.1.2. Con: Since humans have evolved to live in an industrialized world, predictions based on the past may not be an accurate depiction
1.7. Con: Potential for cultural abandonment of human liberty in favor of micromanagement.
1.7.1. Pro: Once people in positions of power realise that social behaviour is broadly determined by our evolutionary impulses, they may reject the concept of human liberty and use this to justify hyper-paternalism.
1.8. Pro: Many current political lacunae could be broken down into their source elements and addressed individually at the right layer of analysis.
1.9. Con: Some ideas in contemporary evolutionary psychology depend on a number of [fallacies](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-fallacies-of-pop-evolutionary-2012-12-07/).
1.9.1. Con: Evolutionary accounts of psychology can be empirically tested and falsified.
1.9.1.1. Pro: In 2008, psychologists tested the hypothesis that [human memory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41415714_Evolutionary_Psychology_Controversies_Questions_Prospects_and_Limitations) is particularly sensitive to content relevant to evolutionary fitness eg. memory about food, predators, shelter, and mating. Their study confirmed this to be accurate, but had specialized sensitivity to survival-relevant content not been observed, then the hypothesis would have been falsified. \(p. 3\)
1.9.1.2. Pro: In 2000, the [error management theory](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/webdocs/EMT.html) \(based on evolutionary psychology\) was tested in relation to [commitment scepticism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_management_theory#Skeptical_commitment_bias) in women. This underwent [empirical testing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41415714_Evolutionary_Psychology_Controversies_Questions_Prospects_and_Limitations), which could have confirmed or falsified it \(p. 3\).
1.9.2. Pro: Evolutionary psychology erroneously assumes that the human mind can be explained by reference to [Pleistocene adaptive problems](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-fallacies-of-pop-evolutionary-2012-12-07/).
1.9.2.1. Pro: The problems humans face today are unlikely to be analogous to adaptive problems in the Pleistocene. Therefore, evolutionary psychology cannot accurately or reliably map these early adaptive problems onto modern problems.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: It is likely that many of the adaptive problems confronted by early humans in the Pleistocene were a matter of life-or-death. Yet very few problems faced by humans today pose such a threat, especially in relation to the subject matter of social psychology.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: The severity of our interactions with nature today are significantly more buffered \(sparing the odd contagion or natural disaster\) however humans interacting with humans, vying for offspring and by extension social status to mate, which kinds of genes lend themselves to either prestige, physical health markers intuited by the opposite sex, and the way these frame the limitations of individual success have likely changed only in small ways.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: This doesn't make evolutionary psychology irrelevant to social psychology. Humans are applying the brains developed through natural selection to problems in the modern environment.
1.9.2.2. Pro: It is [difficult to know](http://ttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-fallacies-of-pop-evolutionary-2012-12-07/) with any real specificity what our adaptive problems were in the Pleistocene, which means explaining social psychology by reference to these is likely to be either vague or inaccurate.
1.9.2.3. Con: If studies of human behavior as compared to animal behavior are able to be handled rigorously and the strengths and holes of lenses such as evolutionary game theory can be used to set high quality standards for interpretation of experiments we may be able to make headway with our understanding of how survival competition shapes human behavior, societal behavior, and attempt to build institutions that are resilient and pro-social in their impact without knowing historical contingencies.
1.9.3. Pro: Evolutionary psychologists assume that we can discover what is distinctively human about our psychology. Yet this is impossible because there is [no comparative method available](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-fallacies-of-pop-evolutionary-2012-12-07/) to differentiate uniquely human behaviours from the behaviours of our closest non-human relatives because all our hominin relatives are extinct.
1.9.3.1. Con: Knowing what behaviors are distinct to our particular species may not be needed to address the more immediate need - ie. a predictive, preventative, and cultivating model of humans and society that's more robust and nuanced in its explanatory power than theism, communism, capitalism, or any other single-issue frame that's been popular in previous centuries.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Theistic models of reality structure themselves as bodies of cultural knowledge superintended by a wise elect \(whether a priesthood, druids, or technocrats\) and only get replaced when the cultural and transactional needs they serve either have been solved by qualitatively better replacements or meet a new landscape \(much like now\) where a new wisdom corpus is needed to handle that terrain. Many people would suggest that the 4th industrial revolution might precede such a turning as 500 BC.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: Any truly effective replacement for religion would have to understand most or all of what religion is doing and do the same thing more competently and with far fewer ideological casualties.
1.9.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Said body may even need to abandon reductive materialism in very limited, narrow, and lawful ways if there are more abstract and noumenal properties of life and being which need their own appropriate answer reflected in the environment so long as said reflections aren't damaging to the civil liberties of anyone who would choose not to participate..
1.9.3.1.2. Pro: Theistic models of human behaviour tend to violate [Occam's razor](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Occams-razor) because they conjure up new, complex entities to explain our observations. This heavily compromises their explanatory power.
1.9.3.1.2.1. Pro: Christian models of human behaviour often refer to the concept of [original sin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/original-sin), which introduces a whole host of new - largely unverifiable - concepts like God, the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, a talking snake, a tree of knowledge, an apple, and angels.
1.10. Con: Can be misused in early stages by race supremacists, social Darwinists, and people with a destructively competitive agenda.
1.10.1. Con: Any novel approaches or research can be misused for dubious purposes.
1.10.2. Con: These counters aren't relevant, or at least disturbing in that they seem to suggest that science shouldn't be done if people will misuse or misinterpret its findings.
1.10.2.1. Con: The implied suggestion is valid; social harmony should always take precedence over scientific knowledge.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: Intuitively, people and human rights are more important than socio-psychological frameworks of analysis, no matter how evidentially supported they are.
1.10.3. Pro: Biological determinism has been used to fuel racist agendas in the past.
1.10.3.1. Con: It is now illegal to advance racist agendas. Therefore, there is no real risk of these historical examples repeating themselves.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: In 1969, the UN's [International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cerd.aspx) came into force.
1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Various [US laws](https://civilrights.findlaw.com/discrimination/race-discrimination-applicable-laws.html) prohibit racial discrimination.
1.10.3.1.3. Con: [Racism in the US persists](https://time.com/5388356/our-racist-soul/) today and there are no signs of this situation improving. As such, there is a real possibility that history could repeat itself.
1.10.3.2. Pro: According to Social Darwinists, [imperialism is justified](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/social-darwinism-emerges-and-used-justify-imperialism-racism-and-conservative-economic-and-social) because imperial powers are superior and as such, it is in everyone's best interest that they take control.
1.10.3.3. Pro: From 1909 to 1979, around [20,000 sterilizations](https://www.history.com/topics/germany/eugenics#section_3) occurred in California state mental institutions under the guise of protecting society from the offspring of people with mental illness.
1.10.3.4. Pro: Hitler [advocated for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_eugenics) the removal of all non-Aryan races in order to preserve the "biological superiority" of the Aryans.
1.10.3.5. Pro: Many aspects of slavery were justified [using biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Justification_of_slavery_in_the_US). It was claimed that Africans were a different species entirely. It was claimed that their genes were inferior and that they gave rise to "inferior" traits such as reduced sensitivity to pain and intelligence.
