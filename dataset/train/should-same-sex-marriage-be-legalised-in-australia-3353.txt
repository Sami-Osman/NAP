Discussion Name: Should same-sex marriage be legalised in Australia?

1. Should same-sex marriage be legalised in Australia?
1.1. Pro: Promoting stability and permanence in relationships is an inherent social good.
1.1.1. Con: A legal marriage does not equate to a stable and permanant marriage.
1.1.1.1. Con: Marriage does not create stability, but it promotes it, which is what the comment said.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: By this logic, the fact that not all straight marriages lead to children is not an argument for gay marriage, since marriage is designed to promote, not guarantee.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: I refer to marriage as is described in the Marriage Act and words that legally must be spoken in a ceremony for a marriage to be legal. It does not mention children, but it does mention the permanency of the union:

"\(...\) I am bound to remind you publicly of the solemn, and binding nature of the relationship in to which you are about to enter. According to Australian law, marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life."
1.1.1.2. Con: Marriages are by their nature a public declaration of a stable and permanent relationship, with concomitant legal consequences. Not all marriages result in this, but it appears to be the intention.
1.1.2. Pro: If marriage is the foundation of society, by de-linking a permanent, public, legal commitment to a relationship, from the same-sex or heterosexual nature of that relationship, thereby enabling the freedom for _anyone_ to choose to commit to stronger long-term relationships, a stronger society will result.
1.1.2.1. Con: The people who say marriage is the foundation of society, clearly mean marriage to be "between a man and a woman".  The argument \(that you're trying to address\) is that changing the definition of marriage to include same sex couples will mean tearing away at that historical foundation.
1.1.3. Pro: Giving same sex couples rights through marriage encourages gay people to form strong interpersonal connections.
1.2. Con: Legalised same-sex marriage will increase the chance of illegitimate marriages for immigration purposes.
1.2.1. Con: Illegitimate marriages are already a problem with opposite-sex marriages.
1.2.1.1. Pro: To be consistent, if this reason is used to ban same-sex marriage : opposite sex marriage should also be ban.
1.2.2. Con: The issue with this logic is that premise assumes the person using marriage as an immigration tool would not do so if it meant faking a marriage to someone of the opposite sex. There is no evidence for this.
1.2.3. Con: Gay people represent \<10% of the population, any increase in illegitimate marriages would be negligible and our customs & immigration policies are already sufficient to handle it.
1.2.3.1. Con: The fact that gay people represent 10% of the population is irrelevant when speaking about illegitimate marriage. People do not need to be really homosexual to marry with a person of the same sex. Heterosexual do not really need to be in love either when they marry to give citizenship statue.
1.2.4. Pro: People of the opposite sex are already using illegitimate marriage for immigration purposes. We have all the reason to believe that if same sex marriage is allowed people of the same sex will also try using illegitimate marriage to gain citizenship.
1.2.5. Con: Immigration is not wrong. Everyone has the right to move.
1.3. Pro: Same sex marriages can be a boon for the economy.
1.3.1. Pro: Wedding-related industries \(bakers, decorators, photographers, etc\) would see more business.
1.3.1.1. Con: Practitioners may have to service weddings against their conscience
1.3.1.1.1. Con: They will not. Nor do they have to now. It is true that they will have access to more business, but will not be compelled to take it.
1.3.2. Pro: Estimates on the economic impact of same-sex weddings in the US cited a growth of up to [$70 billion](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/economic-impact-reports/spending-on-weddings-of-same-sex-couples-in-the-united-states/) for the wedding industry.
1.3.2.1. Con: Money spend on gay weddings then cannot be spend on something else. Other industries will likely shrink to accommodate the growth of the wedding industry.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The wedding industry spends the money it earns on other industries, such as photogrpahers or bakeries.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: This is true of literally any business.
1.3.3. Con: Campaigners would stop paying for advertisements on TV. Taken together more than [$2 million](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/14/marriage-equality-opponents-have-spent-five-times-more-on-tv-ads-analyst-says) were spend in Australia so far.
1.3.3.1. Con: They may not. People unhappy with the status quo are free to allocate resources to raise awareness/campaign for change. This has been happening consistently, albeit on a smaller scale, since the 2004 amendments to the Marriage Act \(and prior\).
1.3.3.2. Con: Have you ever got married? $2,000,000 could easily be the cost of 20 expensive weddings.
1.3.4. Pro: Divorce lawyers would also see more business.
1.4. Pro: Changing the Marriage Act allows same sex couples the same legal protections as opposite sex couples.
1.4.1. Pro: After death, legalised same-sex marriage will make a same-sex partner's claim on property more legitimate in; the eyes of the court.
1.4.2. Con: Marriage is a privilege, not a right.
1.4.2.1. Con: Marriage offers legal and financial benefits.  It is a choice to get married, but all citizens have a right to the legal and financial benefits and withholding it from any would be discrimination.
1.4.2.2. Con: A privilege can be extended to same-sex couples.
1.4.2.3. Con: This claim has no impact on the parent claim. Marriage's status as a right or privilege does not change the fact that the government has a responsibility to act fairly and equally on behalf of all its citizens.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Even if marriage is a privilege not a right ; allowing it to opposite people and refusing it to same sex is discrimination.
1.4.2.4. Con: The UN declaration of Human Rights considers marriage a right [as per article 16](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)
1.4.2.5. Con: Actually, marriage in Australia is overseen by the legal system, not the church. Therefore, by definition, it is in fact a right.
1.4.3. Pro: Same sex couples should get the same rights as straight couples
1.4.4. Con: The same could easily be achieved though laws about civil union.
1.4.5. Pro: Marriage as a marital status has legal weight. It is a contract and it is unfair to prohibit people of the same gender to engage in it.
1.4.5.1. Con: Same sex marriage legislation is not necessary in order to provide legal protections to same sex relationships. Same sex couples can have civil unions which can serve the same legal function.  Giving them the status of "marriage" is more a cultural issue than a legal one.
1.5. Pro: Discrimination against and oppression of LGBTQIA+ people should be eliminated, not only in law, but in society as a whole. The law should be changed to support this goal.
1.5.1. Pro: Legalising same sex marriage would send a message that same sex attraction is OK, and would reduce the stigma.
1.5.1.1. Con: There are many people in relationships that do not have the legal status or equivalence of marriage, and they do not suffer from stigma.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: There are few types of non-legal unions aside from same-sex, and they do suffer stigma e.g. incestuous, polygamous, underage.
1.5.1.2. Pro: By the very prohibition of same-sex marriage, society expresses its opinion of same-sex couples, irregardless of the choice of some couples to remain de-facto.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Some people see in the law a moral compass and construct their value system based on what is legal. Some peoples use the fact that homosexual marriage is not legal to claim homosexuality is a bad thing. Changing the law will influence those people.
1.5.2. Con: There's nothing inherently wrong with discrimination; it's a practical necessity of life.  LGBT people discriminate against each other by virtue of e.g. who they are attracted to.  If you're a lesbian, you discriminate against men when it comes to having sex, and they should have that right to discriminate.
1.6. Pro: The sexual morality of individuals is not in the hands of the government.
1.6.1. Con: Marriage does not confer legality of sexual rights, as the above post suggests, so it is not necessary to legitimise such behaviours as they are already legal.
1.6.2. Pro: The Australian government permits sodomy, fornication, adultery, gang bangs, homosexual acts, etc.
1.6.3. Con: In fact, there is a huge number of laws which deal with what could be called sexual morality, such as the age of consent.[eg](http://www.lawstuff.org.au/nsw_law/topics/sex/article)
1.6.4. Con: That argument is fallacious. If marriage is a state legislated act then the "sexual morality" of individuals is in the hands of the government, as those individuals are impeding on a government legislated act.
1.6.5. Con: If marriage is something that gays believe should not be regulated by the government, then marriage is merely a ceremony and should not affect any gay couple. Any legal/financial differences to legal marriage can be sorted out with civil unions.
1.7. Pro: Same-sex marriage would be in line with human rights
1.7.1. Pro: For the respect to the right to free personality, enshrined in Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.7.1.1. Pro: To choose a project of life is an aspect of a free personality.
1.7.2. Pro: Love is not a choice. It comes naturally, like the law of attraction.
1.7.3. Con: Legalising same-sex marriage impinges on religious freedom.
1.7.3.1. Con: No it doesn't, your are completely free to have an opposite sex marriage if that's what your religion demands.  Your religion is not the same as everyone else's religion, you live by your religion's rules let others live by their religion/beliefs
1.7.3.2. Con: An argument against sam-sex marriage on the basis that it somehow violates religious freedom does not make sense, provided that churches and officials are not required to to perform gay marriages.

In fact, the practice to deny religions that do recognize gay marriage to perform them should be suspect of violation, as should any law that exists solely as a result of religious tradition. This is by definition an establishment of a state religion. \(note: this is from an American's POV\)
1.7.3.3. Pro: Not allowing it creates needless divisions within society, not to mention thinning out the married-parent pool. Do we want that? If there are kids in foster homes and a same-sex couple available to adopt them, then why not make use of that resource. In my experience, levels of stability&development are much like any other. There seems to be no meaningful argument against it other than people don't like it. I don't like liquorice, but I don't care enough to push for it to be it banned.
1.7.3.4. Con: If same sex marriage is legalised in Australia, people will still be free to not marry a person of the same sex as themselves if they feel  this does not line up with their religion.
1.7.3.5. Con: Having equal rights and privileges for a minority is more important than every religious demand being accepted.
1.7.3.6. Con: As religion is not demonstrably true, it's foolish to base laws around it.
1.7.3.6.1. Con: Many people accept that religion is demonstrated to be true to their personal level of satisfaction.
1.7.3.6.1.1. Con: An individual's sense of morality cannot be used to determine course of law. Law must transcend the individual's understanding of right and wrong in order to protect the rights of all individuals. 

For example, simply if I consider Christianity to be wrong or immoral does not validate an argument that Christianity should be banned. My personal sense of "right" and "wrong" cannot extend to limiting the rights of others.
1.7.3.7. Pro: Legalised same sex marriage could change the religious teachings to include matters not mentioned in holy texts
1.7.3.7.1. Con: This hasn't been borne out in other areas, such as the legalisation of sexwork or drug use.
1.7.3.7.2. Con: The Australian government doesn't have the authority or ability to "change religious teachings including matters not mentioned in holy texts".  Therefore this is not a reasonable claim.
1.7.3.7.3. Con: it is not the government's role to ensure contiguity in religious teachings.
1.7.3.8. Con: Legalizing same sex marriage would allow same sex couples to make a decision about their own lives which have nothing to do with someone else's religion.
1.7.3.9. Con: It is conceivable that there exists religions that allow same-sex marriage. If the above claim is true, then it not legalising same-sex marriage would impinge on their religious freedom.
1.7.3.9.1. Pro: In fact, the current law, by prohibiting same sex marriage, actually impinges on religious freedom for those churches and other religious institutions that permit \(and would otherwise perform\) same sex marriage ceremonies.
1.7.3.9.2. Pro: There are many Jewish traditions and Christian denominations that are in favor of gay marriage, as well as some East Asian religions that are in favor of it, as evidenced by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion). There are also some minor religions that are in favor of gay marriage.
1.7.3.9.3. Con: This is not the case for the worlds major religions, so is only hypothetical unless evidenced otherwise.
1.7.3.9.3.1. Con: The law applies to all religions \(not just major ones\) and to atheists as well.
1.7.3.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.9.2.
1.7.3.9.3.3. Con: In most countries that honour religious liberty, the right to not be religious is likewise protected. A religious ideology is forced onto non-believers by prohibiting them from gay marriage. If this is the case in Australia, then there does not need to be evidence that such a religion exists, or that you personally are a member.
1.7.3.9.4. Con: An equivalent argument could be made for a religion that wishes to sacrifice people. Religious freedom is not without limited.
1.7.3.9.4.1. Con: Religious freedom may only be limited when it violates the rights of others, as would be the case of human sacrifice - certainly of unwilling participants, and arguably of any participant regardless of will given the permanence of the ritual.
1.7.3.10. Con: Civil Law is not implicated by the wants of religious groups, therefore any arguments against marriage on the grounds of religious freedoms/expectations is folly.
1.7.3.10.1. Pro: Marriage is older than any religion and people should have the same rights
1.7.3.11. Con: Section 47 of the Marriage Act already provides religious freedom. Religions are already permitted to have different rules \(for example, the Roman Catholic Church will not remarry divorcees\).
1.7.3.12. Con: Marriage was not created by a religion.
1.7.3.12.1. Con: Even if marriage was not created by a religion, it can become religious when perform by a priest or inside a religious building. As so, if legalized, this should be taken in reflection : should priest \(who believe marriage is a ceremony of god\) by force to perform same gender marriage?
1.7.4. Con: Marriage is a legal status. It is not a right.
1.7.5. Pro: Denying some people the option to marry is discriminatory and creates a second class of citizens
1.7.5.1. Pro: Children of unmarried same-sex couples are humiliated by the second class status of their parents.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: This logic suggests the children of single parents are also humiliated. What we should be doing is teaching kids that their classmates' family situation is not the latter's fault, and humiliation for any reason is wrong - not that only certain types of humiliation are wrong.
1.7.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.7.5.1.3. Con: Same sex couples have higher [educational achievements](http://www.businessinsider.com/census-data-on-gay-households-2015-6?IR=T) compared to opposite sex couples.
1.7.5.1.3.1. Con: Wealth and educational outcomes are certainly ways to measure status, but so are legal rights. Children of same sex children may well be happy about their parents' income and may do well in school, but still be humiliated by their parents' lack of legal rights.
1.7.5.1.4. Con: Same sex couples have a [higher household income](http://www.businessinsider.com/census-data-on-gay-households-2015-6?IR=T) than opposite sex couples.
1.7.5.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.7.5.1.3.1.
1.7.5.2. Con: There are many other people who cannot legally marry, such as those whose culture allows multiple wives or marriage to cousins, and neither we nor they consider them second class citizens. Marriage recognition of your relationship is not a prerequisite of being a first class citizen, as those in de facto relationships know.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Those are all choices, this is a right. Straight people can marry someone that is of the gender they are biologically attracted to, gay people cannot
1.7.5.2.1.1. Con: Choices and rights are not mutually exclusive nor in opposition here \(e.g. "the right to choose to marry person X"\).  Just because something is a choice, doesnt mean it isn't also a right, and vise versa.  And since your second claim presumes that attraction is biologically predetermined, it contradicts your first claim that e.g. attraction to cousins \(family\) or mutiple people \(mutiple wives\) are choices.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: Those should be legalized, too.
1.7.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #939: Polygamy should be legal.
1.7.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.7.5.4. Pro: The government has the responsibility to be as indiscriminatory as possible.
1.7.5.5. Con: Discrimination is not inherently a bad thing. Denying adults the option to marry little children or farm animals is also discriminatory.
1.8. Con: Marriage as an institution has become a tradition that should not be changed.
1.8.1. Con: Marriage has changed over time and marriage has not always been only one man and one woman.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Marriage has included polygamy in the past in some cultures, and even today some countries have legal polygamy.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Moses, who had the ten commandments revealed to him, had three wives. Biblical marriage and marriage today are completely different.[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy_in_Christianity)
1.8.1.3. Pro: Marriage itself has transformed significantly. For example, in the past weddings were arranged between living and [deceased children](https://www.livescience.com/37777-history-of-marriage.html) to strengthen bonds between families.
1.8.1.4. Con: Marriage is an ancient construct that should not be changed.
1.8.1.4.1. Con: Many traditional elements of marriage involve the father transferring ownership of his daughter to her husband. These traditions are gone now.
1.8.1.4.2. Con: The Marriage Act has been changed as recently as [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1961_\(Australia\)#Marriage_Amendment_Act_2004).
1.8.1.4.3. Con: Tradition isn't a sacrosanct concept. It should be changed.
1.8.1.4.4. Con: Many ancient constructs, such as slavery, have been abolished.
1.8.1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.8.1.3.
1.8.1.4.6. Con: Other elements of a "traditional" definition of marriage have included marriage of children, marriage based on the consent of the parents rather than on the consent of the couple, and loss of separate legal personality of a married woman. All of these have already been changed.
1.8.2. Pro: An institution that arose organically before the rise of the nation-state ought to be respected.
1.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.
1.8.2.2. Con: Same sex marriage recognises the importance of marriage as an institution - that's why they want to be included in it.
1.8.2.3. Con: The religious institution of marriage is distinct from the civil legal concept which has transformed over time. Religious institutions should be free to adhere to their understanding of marriage \(i.e. between a man and a woman\), but the civil legal concept should be allowed to continue develop in line with society's progression.
1.8.2.4. Con: The role of marriage has changed over the course of the last 100 years to match economic and cultural needs. It is fair to say that pre-historic marriage likewise differed dramatically, perhaps to the extent that it is not recognizable by a modern perspective. I have a very hard time imagining prehistoric people holding mid-century marital values like like Fred and Wilma Flintstone.
1.8.2.5. Con: Many institutions and conventions that arose before nation states no longer have a place in modern society, and have either adapted to better suit society, or been abandoned altogether. Slavery, ritual sacrifice, Hair Metal, etc..
1.8.2.6. Con: -> See 1.7.3.10.1.
1.8.3. Pro: Allowing same-sex marriage will remove the boundary lines of what marriage is and could lead to other relationships vying for their status' to be recognized through marriage as well, i.e. polygamous marriage or familial marriage \(2 brothers or 2 sisters getting married\).
1.8.3.1. Con: Polygamous marriages and sibling marriages are not inherently bad things.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.
1.8.4. Con: Traditions change constantly everywhere in the world.
1.8.4.1. Con: That traditions do change does not mean traditions should change.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Cultural traditions change when there is [a change in social values](http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_196702_snyder.pdf).
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: [LGBT social movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements) have brought global awareness on the importance to recognize same-sex unions.
1.8.5. Con: 'Tradition' is another word for 'that's how we've done things for a while'. This does not inherently make it something that shouldn't be changed.
1.8.6. Pro: The institution of marriage has traditionally been defined as being between a man and a woman.
1.8.6.1. Con: Same-sex marriage was happening in Rome before around [300AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions) \(when Christianity had it outlawed and they were all executed\).
1.8.6.2. Con: The institution of marriage, even in Australia, has been in flux even in the last century. It wasn't long ago that inter-racial marriage was illegal, and men could legally marry a 14 year old girl.
1.8.6.3. Con: The Marriage Act in Australia prior to 2004 did not define marriage as between a man and a woman.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: Before 2004 [the term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1961_\(Australia\)#Marriage_Amendment_Act_2004) 'marriage was not defined'.
1.8.6.4. Con: Society and norms change over time, keeping to older norms just because they existed in the past is not necessarily a good idea.
1.8.6.5. Con: -> See 1.8.1.4.6.
1.9. Con: Same sex marriage will have a negative impact on education.
1.9.1. Con: Teaching about same sex marriage in school is a good thing to do as it sensitivizes children for the society they are going to live in.
1.9.2. Con: It will not affect education in a negative way as children are very open-minded and will be understanding.
1.9.3. Pro: Teachers will be forced to teach same-sex marriage in schools.
1.9.3.1. Con: "Teaching it" would probably fall more along the lines of "explaining it exists", which isn't traumatic or wrong.
1.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.
1.9.3.3. Con: Every worker on the planet sells their time to their employer, at which point they are to do what is asked of them. If this conflicts with one's beliefs and code, they are free to seek employment elsewhere or swallow their pride.
1.9.3.4. Con: Children do not inherently know if a social construct is good or bad. Children only know the 'homosexuality is wrong' when they are taught it. If children are not taught it is wrong there would be no reason to teach them it is not wrong in school.
1.9.3.5. Con: Making schools more welcoming to LGBTQI students is a good thing.
1.9.3.5.1. Pro: Teenage LGBTQI students do not have access to popular spots of the LGBTQI community as bars and social clubs are not always allowing teenagers.
1.9.3.5.2. Pro: [Half](http://www.glhv.org.au/files/wti3_web_sml.pdf) the LGBTQI students do not learn at a school that has features supporting sexual diversity \(p.x\).
1.9.3.6. Pro: Changing the content of classes will necessitate a change to the curriculum.
1.9.3.6.1. Con: Curriculae should change with time.  Learning and education should always keep up with the latest scientific evidence and social norms.
1.9.3.7. Con: If children who are older than 12 are taught this in school, it would be educational and informative.
1.9.3.8. Con: If children don't learn this in school, they'll learn it somewhere else. Children have access to the internet from the age of 5 by now
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.9.3.5.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.9.3.8.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.11. Con: Marriage should not be recognised in law. Therefore, same-sex marriage should not be legalised.
1.11.1. Pro: Marriage is cultural and religious, and should not be over-seen by the government. The government should be responsible for [civil unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union) and cultural/religious institutions should be responsible for "marriages."
1.11.1.1. Pro: Legal marriage \(governed by the state\), umbrellas many laws and issues that should be considered separately; including immigration, guardianship of minors and property.
1.11.1.2. Con: A "seperate but equal" set of laws is segregation, and therefore marked as not equal. If they were equal, they would be one set of laws.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: unless all couples regardless of sex and gender be required to use the same civil union framework, and allow civil institutions \(such as churches and families\) perform weddings. Doing so would recognize the legal and cultural limitations of law and marriage.
1.11.1.3. Con: The law as it stands currently also precludes cultural and religious groups from marrying same sex couples; to your point, the state should retract its influence by removing any legal restrictions to marriage bar those that lead to the violation of other laws \(e.g. child marriage\).
1.11.1.4. Con: Perhaps it should be, but it is not. This law change would be compatible with the current system - that is to say - marriage is a non-religious term
1.11.1.5. Con: Marriages predate Christian religion. Religion has no right over marriages.
1.11.1.5.1. Con: If predate is a valid argument to determine if something have right over something else : government have no right over land, people, weapon, etc. All those predate the government. Date of creation is not a valid way to decide who have right over what.
1.11.1.6. Con: The attachment of any legal benefit to marriage speaks to marriage's legal role in Australian society. If marriage is truly cultural and religious, then the term should be separated from all legal marriages, not just homosexual ones.
1.11.1.6.1. Con: The institution of marriage exists as a religious, civil as well as a legal construct.  We need not use the term marriage when alternative terms such as “civil unions” adequately describe what is required under the law.
1.11.1.6.1.1. Pro: What purpose is there for a legal definition for marriage when already there is civil union? A marriage is an agreement between a couple and God, and a Civil Union is an agreement between consenting parties. For a country that honours religious freedom, defining marriage legally is inappropriate.
1.11.1.6.1.2. Con: If there is more than one legal construct that is essentially "marriage", governments, businesses, and individuals may discriminate against the new type of marriage \(we'll call it civil unions, for sake of argument\) by providing services, rights, and benefits exclusively to marriages, and not to civil unions. The only way to ensure this is administrated fairly is to completely abolish the legal concept of marriage, and replace it with a more religion-agnostic term.
1.11.1.6.2. Pro: All "marriages" regardless of with whom, should be treated as contractual agreements between consenting parties.
1.11.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.
1.11.1.7. Con: Marriages are, as far as the law is concerned, civil unions. Marriage is recognised in the Constitution as a topic for laws, and there is no reason why the legal form of marriage has to take notice of the religious form or have the same rules. In fact Australia is relatively unusual in allowing religious figures to perform legally binding ceremonies. Most countries simply ignore religious ceremonies.
1.11.2. Con: Legal marriage gives certainty to the couple in case of divorce.
1.11.2.1. Con: Contractual obligations can be agreed to by any consenting party. 'Marriage' as a state-sponsored institution is unnecessary regardless of sexual orientation.
1.11.3. Pro: The state is morally illegitimate. Therefore, laws including marriage laws are morally illegitimate.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Marriage laws enforced by the state is the use or threat of the initiation of force, which is immoral.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: States own the means of violence. They have the moral authority to threaten violence
1.11.3.1.2. Con: This argument is within the framework of the state existing, the morality of the state and whether or not it should exist is irrelevant to the big picture of this argument.
1.11.3.2. Con: States are legitimized through elections. It is the citizens themselves that give them the laws.
1.11.3.3. Con: States are legitimized by their provision of public goods.
1.11.3.4. Con: States need to secure private rights so that individuals can flourish.
1.11.3.5. Con: The state's moral legitimacy has no impact on the enforcement of contractual obligations.
1.11.4. Con: If this is the case, abolish opposite sex marriage.
1.11.5. Con: Right now marriage is recognised in law. Stopping same-sex marriage is not a step towards making marriage not recognised in law.
1.12. Con: Same sex marriage is forbidden by God according to the Bible. It is not a bad idea to create laws contrary to the Law of God.
1.12.1. Con: The law of a whole country shouldn't be based on one  religion. There are multiple religions active in Australia. The law shouldn't be based on one of them.
1.12.2. Con: The Bible also condemns tattoos, certain clothing, certain food, says women should be subordinate to men and promotes slavery. Few people follow the rules put forth in the Bible.
1.12.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #16245: Christianity is compatible with feminism.
1.12.3. Con: -> See discussion #18187: The Bible does not support the conclusion that 'homosexuality' is a sin against God.
1.13. Pro: There is no reason not to allow same-sex couples to marry simply because of their genders - it doesn't negatively affect anybody.
1.13.1. Pro: Many other countries in the world have allowed same-sex marriage
1.13.1.1. Pro: Ireland legalised same sex marriage following a constitutional referendum in 2014 which inserted the following amendment into the constitution: "Marriage may be contracted in accordance with the law by two persons without distinction as to their sex." \[Irish Constitution, Article 40.4\]
1.13.1.2. Pro: The same-sex marriage is a wave crossing the entire world. As fast as being legalised, Australia will get a new status in the planet, were love and freedom are before old beliefs that hurts people.
1.13.1.3. Pro: New Zealand became the 13th country worldwide to legalise gay marriage in [2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204803/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/133170/marriage-legislation-becomes-law). It was passed into law with [77 ayes against 44 noes](https://web.archive.org/web/20150511200841/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130417_00000020/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-%E2%80%94-third).
1.13.1.4. Pro: As of [1 October 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage), same-sex marriage is legally recognized in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands,New Zealand,Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage is likely to soon become legal in Taiwan, after a constitutional court ruling in May 2017.
1.13.1.5. Con: This is an appeal to authority. Many other countries used to use and research unethical weapons, had capital punishment, and commit other heinous acts. Did that make it somehow ethical?
1.13.1.6. Con: This is a bandwagonning fallacy. Just because of a crowd does something, does not mean what they are doing is right.
1.13.2. Pro: Homosexuality is natural.
1.13.2.1. Pro: Homosexuality is prevalent in human society since [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality).
1.13.2.1.1. Con: Heterosexuality is and has always been more prevalent
1.13.2.1.2. Con: Prevalence in a society does not make an act acceptable to a society.
1.13.2.1.3. Con: Murder, rape and theft have been prevalent in society since antiquity.
1.13.2.2. Pro: Animals do exhibit homosexual behaviour and it's therefore natural.
1.13.2.2.1. Pro: The idea that homossexuality is unnatural is actually a myth. Homossexual behaviour has been observed and well documented in dozens of animal species, both in captivity and in their natural habitats. It is empirically false that homossexuality is unnatural.
[Homossexual behavior in animals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals)
1.13.2.2.1.1. Con: Homosexuality is far less natural than heterosexuality.  The fact that it does occasionally occur, doesnt mean it's the norm or statstically significant \(almost everything occurs with some frequency\).  In terms of reproduction, evolution naturally selects against homosexual organisms since they cannot reproduce with each other \(their same-sex partner\) i.e. without co-opting heterosexual reproductive techniques.  Natural selection favors heterosexuality as the norm for sexual reproduction.
1.13.2.2.2. Con: [Infanticide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide_in_primates) is also naturally occuring. As is [cannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cannibalism) and coprophagia \(eating fecal matter\). The "argument" of things being natural equating to justified morality is a fallacy.
1.13.2.2.2.1. Con: [Whataboutism Fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) The claim was whether or not homosexuality was naturally occurring, not about whether everything naturally occurring is good or bad, in response to the con's claim that "Marriage...between a man and a woman...is a natural phenomenon."
1.13.2.2.3. Con: Just because something is natural does not make it right. Sexual drives are natural but acting on every impulse is certainly not right, especially when one side is not consenting.
1.13.2.2.4. Pro: - All in animal kingdom is natural.
- There are several species of animals having same-sex intercourse.
Concluding that your statement about the nature of same-sexuality is false.
[Wikipage about the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals)
1.13.2.3. Con: Natural things can be negative for a society. The fact that homosexuality is natural does not provide a base to validate that it should be legalize.
1.13.2.3.1. Con: The above claim is referring to the fact that many people object to homosexuality by claiming that it is unnatural. Not everything that is natural is beneficial, but certainly if something is both natural and not harmful in any way, then there is no good reason to prevent it. Homosexuality falls into this category.
1.13.2.4. Pro: To be clear, [bisexuality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432799/) should be normal to the human brain. Thus homosexuality is completely normal. Being left handed is normal, so is being attracted to the same gender/sex.
1.13.2.4.1. Con: What it means to be 'normal', is to be 'like the majority' i.e. "the norm". Many things are natural, but not normal. Bisexuality and homosexuality may be naturally occuring, but dont reflect the majority sexual orientation.  The vast majority of people and other sexually reproducing organisms are oriented to heterosexuality. Thus, heterosexuality is normal, but homosexuality is not; it is instead a rarity; a deviation from the norm.
1.14. Pro: A [majority](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41992344) of Australians declared that it should be legalised in the non-binding survey conducted.
1.14.1. Con: Aboriginal people oppose same sex marriage as illustrated by the [Uluru Bark Petitition](http://ulurubarkpetition.com). Given the special place they have in the history of Australia their voice should be followed.
1.14.1.1. Con: The Uluru Bark Petition was signed by [~30 people](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/mutitjulu-unaware-of-uluru-bark-petition-on-sanctity/news-story/e1fe9dbaf5dcffa439b07716d01eb2f3), and the people who live in Mutitjulu \(the Aboriginal community closest to Uluru\) were not even aware of it.
1.14.1.2. Con: There is no one 'Aboriginal people' to use as a representative body. Indigenous Australians \(Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders\) are members of hundreds of different nations and clans; one petition by 30 Aboriginal people, and backed by non-Indigenous Church members does not represent a whole racial group.
1.14.1.3. Con: Even if true, permitting gay marriage would not force Aboriginal people, or anyone else for that matter, into gay marriage. A ban gay marriage benefits only those unaffected by it.
1.14.1.4. Con: The petitition is misleading as not all Aboriginal people oppose same sex marriage contrary to what is [claimed](http://www.sbs.com.au/programs/australias-secret-heroes/video/506512451546/Aboriginal-LGBTQI-speaks-against-Aboriginal-petiti).
1.14.1.4.1. Pro: The [LGBTQI Aboriginal community](http://www.sbs.com.au/programs/australias-secret-heroes/video/506512451546/Aboriginal-LGBTQI-speaks-against-Aboriginal-petiti) supports same sex marriage.
1.14.1.5. Con: Aboriginal people are a minority and in democratic processes their voice should be equally important as of any other citizen.
1.14.1.5.1. Pro: The suggestion that the voices of Aboriginal people should have more weight than others is inherently undemocratic and should be discarded.
1.14.1.6. Con: Non-Aboriginal people have also created petitions that oppose marriage equality. This does not mean they represent the majority of non-Aboriginal Australians.
1.14.1.7. Con: To claim an entire group of people hold a particular view based on the views expressed by some people in that group is dangerous stereotyping.
1.15. Con: Marriage is tied to procreation, and same-sex couples cannot procreate.
1.15.1. Con: Adoption is not only an option, but a damned good one that could be incentivized at that.
1.15.2. Con: People in childless heterosexual marriages due to infertility are not forced to divorce.
1.15.3. Con: Married heterosexual couples who are past childbearing age are not forced to divorce.
1.15.4. Con: Actually, [same-sex couples will soon be able to genetically procreate.](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/05/16/can-same-sex-parents-both-be-biological-parents-of-their-child/) It's likely it'll only be a decade before this will be available. Already several countries including the UK allow babies to be created from the DNA of three people, including two mothers. The parent argument is entirely and utterly void.
1.15.5. Con: Marriage is tied to tax law. In Australian tax law '[spouse](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-return/2016/Tax-return/Spouse-details---married-or-de-facto-2016/)', for example, has a special status.
1.15.6. Con: You can be married and have no kids, or not be married and have kids. It's actually irrelevant to procreation.
1.15.7. Con: Even if having kids was the goal, homosexuals can have children through surrogacy and adoption.
1.15.8. Con: [Childless couples](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-15/childless-households-on-the-rise/8528546) will outnumber couples with children by 2023 in Australia. The ability to procreate doesn't seem to be a defining criteria for marriage.
1.15.9. Con: Infertile heterosexual people are still allowed to marry, so the link between marriage and procreation seems insignificant.
1.15.10. Con: There is no evidence of people objecting to the marriage of heterosexual couples that either do not want children or know that they cannot have children.
