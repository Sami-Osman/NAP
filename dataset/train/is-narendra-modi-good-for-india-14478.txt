Discussion Name: Is Narendra Modi good for India?

1. Narendra Modi has been good for India.
1.1. Con: Narendra Modi is turning India into an oligarchy and has increased corruption.
1.1.1. Pro: PM Modi and his party have been involved in over 27 financial and governmental [scams](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2018/09/25/A-To-Z-of-scams-Congress-lists-26-scams-of-BJP-in-alphabetical-order.html).
1.1.1.1. Pro: The government's [Rafale defense deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafale_deal_controversy)(The Rafale deal controversy is a political controversy in India related to the purchase of 36 multirole fighter aircraft for a price estimated at €7.8 billion by the Defence Ministry of India from France's Dassault Aviation. The origin of the deal lies in the Indian MMRCA competition, a multi-billion dollar contract to supply 126 multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force \(IAF\).) has been suspected to be a [case of crony capitalism](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/things-to-know-about-rafale-deal-that-heated-up-parliament/why-india-needs-rafale-fighter-jets/slideshow/62838995.cms).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A government-backed entity should have been involved in the deal. Instead the BJP [involved a new company](https://thewire.in/business/rafale-reliance-defence-anil-ambani-narendra-modi) run by Anil D. Ambani to be the offset partner of the deal.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: President Hollande said that the [Indian government proposed Anil Ambani's company](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/rafale-deal-french-president-hollande-claims-india-proposed-anil-ambani-reliance/story/282714.html).
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [Dassault Aviation](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-deal-full-statement-by-dassault-aviation-after-francois-hollandes-stunner-1920377), CEO Eric Trappier, explained in a letter and in an interview that Reliance was their choice. This was in response to former French President Hollande's statement.
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: According to former [President Holland](https://www.wionews.com/india-news/former-french-president-hollande-says-indian-government-proposed-anil-ambanis-reliance), Dassault Aviation was "given no choice but to partner with Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence for the offset clause in the Rafale fighter jet deal."
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: This company gave [1.4 million dollars to Hollande's partner](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rafale-controversy-reliance-entertainment-francois-hollande-bjp-narendra-modi-india-france-5376140/). This is a quid pro quo involving [Reliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries), former French President Hollande, and PM Modi, allowing both to interfere with the decisions of private companies.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: It has been argued that a [big component of the inflated costs was attributed to India-specific enhancements to the jets](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-deal-why-dassault-reliance-aviation-won-the-offsets-contract-some-unanswered-questions/articleshow/65495707.cms).
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Rafale has partnered with [at least](https://www.livefistdefence.com/2018/03/rafale-deal-first-full-details-of-frances-e4-billion-india-offsets-plan.html) 72 companies in India, one of which was [Reliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries). There is no proof that the government helped Reliance obtain the contract.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.2. Pro: While the country reeled under demonetization, the BJP arranged back channels for those close to them to change currency through cooperative banks under their control.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: This behavior has been [regulated and monitored](https://thewire.in/banking/bank-with-amit-shah-as-a-director-collected-highest-amount-of-banned-notes-among-dccbs-rti-reply)(In a spirited and curious defence of ADCB, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Develoment \(NABARD\), India’s apex institution for rural economy credit, noted that all the bank accounts into which the demonetised notes were deposited were verified and checked to see if they had complied with ‘know-your-customer’ \(KYC\) regulations.) by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \(NABARD\).
1.1.1.2.2. Con: There is no evidence that the BJP arranged back channels for those close to them to change the currency through banks under their control.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Most sources provide information on the amount of money deposited and exchanged in the Allahabad Cooperative bank but do not provide any proof about who made the deposits and how they were related to BJP.
1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: In 2021, the [BJP-controlled Mugu Cooperative Bank](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2021/jul/21/bjp-controlled-mugu-cooperative-bank-reports-rs-32-crore-loan-fraud-2333052.html) reported Rs 32 crore loan fraud.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Allahabad Cooperative bank, with Amit Shah as director, [netted the highest deposits](https://thewire.in/banking/bank-with-amit-shah-as-a-director-collected-highest-amount-of-banned-notes-among-dccbs-rti-reply/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) among such banks.
1.1.1.3. Con: PM Modi has been less corrupt than other prominent Indian politicians.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: PM Modi has spent lavishly on his [dresses](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/rs-1-lakh-a-day-for-narendra-modis-beautician-178064-2014-01-23), compared to other politicians, while there is still [notable poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_India) in India.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Appearing sharp is necessary for Prime Ministers, given that they represent India wherever they go.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: It is morally wrong to spend frivolously on personal luxuries when that money [could be used](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/charity/duty_1.shtml) to reduce poverty.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Caring about their appearance does not mean that someone's a bad person; there are many other traits and attributes that are far more important than that.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: PM Modi is not nepotistic in the same way as the [Gandhi family](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48391041) as he does not have a son who could take over his political party \(BJP\) after him.
1.1.2. Con: PM Modi has taken meaningful steps to stamp out corruption in India.
1.1.2.1. Pro: PM Modi's government has consistently removed [archaic and redundant laws](https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/centre-s-clean-up-ct-modi-government-terminates-1-500-archaic-laws-1299212-2018-07-29) which have enabled the powerful to find corrupt loopholes.
1.1.2.2. Con: One of the checks and balances suggested by PM Modi to deal with corruption was to introduce an anti-corruption ombudsman, [Lokpal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokpal)(A Lokpal is an anti-corruption authority or body of ombudsman who represents the public interest in the Republic of India.). However, since 2014, it has done [very little](https://www.firstpost.com/india/lokpal-appointment-narendra-modi-not-in-favour-of-independent-body-congress-wont-attend-meet-just-to-eat-snacks-4372679.html) to quash corruption.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The Lokpal act requires the Leader of Opposition to be involved in the appointment process for it to be legal, but [officially there is no Leader of Opposition](https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/lok-sabha-2019/story/17th-lok-sabha-leader-of-opposition-bjp-congress-1533766-2019-05-24) because Congress has too few seats to qualify.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: [Lokpal](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lokpal-gets-1-190-complaints-in-first-year-none-against-pm-narendra-modi-union-ministers-2157947), the corruption watchdog, was not instituted until March 2019.
1.1.2.3. Pro: [Demonetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation) has increased transparency in the purchase and payment system of property in India.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Post-[demonetisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation), the Modi government de-registered over [100,000 shell companies](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/registration-of-1-lakh-cos-cancelled-37000-shell-firms-identified-pm-modi/articleshow/59402192.cms), blocked their bank accounts and announced "strong action" against 37,000 of these companies.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: It is the duty of the [Income Tax Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Tax_Department) to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion. If PM Modi's aim was to crack down on shell companies, a tax department reform could have taken place, instead of demonetization.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Modi's government has continued to [de-register more "bogus" companies](https://theprint.in/economy/modi-govt-expects-to-deregister-another-20000-bogus-companies-by-end-of-this-year/243694/).
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Demonetization has significantly [harmed the informal sectors](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/economy/article/demonetisation-impacts-india%E2%80%99s-informal-sector-un-report/91269) of India's economy.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Demonetization of high-denomination currency notes \(thereby making illegal [86%](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/india-economy-falters-modi-171011114550066.html) of the total currency in circulation\) has led to many firms operating in the cash-only informal sector, which created many jobs, having to [shut down](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41332272).
1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: Demonetization has successfully [weeded out fake currency notes](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/demonetisation-a-success/article35326808.ece) which has limited terror activities and drug trafficking.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Demonetization has brought about transparency in the [valuation system](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) and enabled the government to detect frauds more easily because it is now able to keep track of extremely large cashless transactions.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: Demonetization's attempts to remove cash from the economy have failed. The amount of currency in public circulation [reached a record high](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/currency-with-public-now-reaches-a-record-over-rs-18-lakh-crore-higher-than-postdemonetisation-days/story/278915.html) on June 1st, 2018.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: Cashless payments account for [less than 5% of all transactions in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/cash-is-king-year-after-note-ban-india-still-remains-a-cash-economy/articleshow/61512446.cms).
1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: [The country's central bank revealed](https://www.dw.com/en/narendra-modis-4-years-in-power-good-or-bad-for-india/a-43974581) that nearly all demonetized currency returned to the system.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3. Con: While true, the Modi government took steps to increase the cashless transaction rate and [set a goal of 25 billion cashless transactions for 2017.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/et-gbs-2017-modi-govt-targets-25-billion-digital-transactions-in-next-financial-year/articleshow/57882035.cms)
1.1.2.3.3.1.4. Pro: In 2018, the [cash-to-GDP ratio](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2018/05/03/chart-cash-to-gdp-ratio-approaches-pre-demonetisation-levels) also reached pre-demonetisation levels.
1.1.2.3.3.1.5. Con: [Digital payments have risen since demonetization](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/demonetisation-4-years-on-a-look-at-what-it-achieved-and-didnt-6086571.html). Total digital payments, in terms of volume, have gone up to 3.4 lakh in 2020 from 70466 in 2016.
1.1.2.3.3.1.6. Con: Demonetization has not been a failure because the [government has now all the material evidence to initiate action against tax evaders](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/demonetisation-a-success/article35326808.ece)(This has given enough ammunition to the opposition parties to blame the government and to term the entire exercise of demonetisation as a failure and an ill-conceived one.\n\nBut the present move by the ED proves that the game is not over and in fact has just started.\n\nThe critics of note ban must ponder now. The government is now having all the material evidences to initiate action on the tax evaders.).
1.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Prior to demonetization, cash transactions were unregulated and unrecorded, making it almost impossible for the government to levy taxes on them.
1.1.2.4. Con: The government passed the [Finance Bill in 2017](https://www.bankbazaar.com/tax/union-budget-finance-bill.html)(The Finance Bill is a part of Budget of India, which specify all legal amendments required for the changes in taxation proposed by the Finance Minister. The lower house of the Parliament Lok Sabha needs to be pass Finance Bill, as a Money Bill. After Lok Sabha's approval Bill becomes Finance Act.). It makes it legal to provide anonymous funding to political parties without any [limit](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/finance-bill-relaxes-corporate-funding-to-political-parties-but-is-the-move-really-evil-4582020/). This allows relationships between the the government and businesses to operate with ease.
1.1.2.5. Pro: The [Direct Benefit Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Benefit_Transfer)(Direct Benefit Transfer or DBT is an attempt to change the mechanism of transferring subsidies launched by Government of India on 1 January 2013. This program aims to transfer subsidies directly to the people through their bank accounts. It is hoped that crediting subsidies into bank accounts will reduce leakages, delays, etc.) - a transfer of subsidies straight into the bank accounts of approximately 250 million people - was a landmark achievement, eliminating several institutionalized corrupt middlemen.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: The Direct Benefit Transfer scheme [was launched in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Benefit_Transfer), before Narendra Modi became PM. The goal of eliminating middlemen is not new.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: PM Modi has [used](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/economy/cash-on-delivery-how-india-has-taken-up-dbt-in-the-times-of-covid-19-72247)(To help people tide over the lockdown, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on March 26, announced a Rs 1.70 lakh crore direct benefit transfer \(DBT\) package for 800 million, or two-thirds, of India’s population under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana \(PMGKY\).\n\nOn May 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an economic recovery package worth Rs 20 lakh crore. Between May 12 and May 17, Sitharaman held four press conferences to give details of the Rs 20 lakh crore recovery package, including the Rs 1.7 lakh crore.) the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme repeatedly during the COVID-19 pandemic, to help significantly more people.
1.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: The [Union Budget of India](https://scroll.in/article/856173/fact-check-was-modi-right-to-claim-that-the-direct-benefit-transfer-scheme-was-started-by-the-nda) announced the Direct Benefit Transfer in February 2013.
1.1.2.5.2. Pro: A government [report](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/direct-benefit-transfer-leads-to-rs-50000-crore-savings-for-government-in-3-years/articleshow/57240387.cms) stated that public savings due to Direct Benefit Transfer over the first three years added up to Rs 50,000 crore \(approximately $7.7 billion\) at the end of 2016.
1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: The Comptroller and Auditor General \(CAG\) has [debunked](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/CAG-audit-nails-Centre%E2%80%99s-claim-on-LPG-subsidy-saving/article14499201.ece) the numbers shown by the centre, indicating that they are not trustworthy.
1.1.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: The number is heavily overstated. The savings mainly come from the [PAHAL \(cooking gas\) scheme](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/page-4-action-may-shift-to-states-as-90-central-schemes-in-dbt/articleshow/62260953.cms?from=mdr)(The two big schemes in which maximum money is being transferred are the LPG Pahal Scheme and MGNREGA programme.).
1.1.2.5.2.1.2. Con: Between benefits transferred in cash and kind, government welfare transfers amounted to [Rs 5.52 trillion in 2020-21](https://www.livemint.com/), compared with Rs 7,367 crore in 2013-14.
1.1.2.5.2.2. Pro: The [equivalent of nearly a year’s subsidy was saved](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/direct-benefit-transfer-leads-to-rs-50000-crore-savings-for-government-in-3-years/articleshow/57240387.cms?from=mdr)(“The savings figure is expected to significantly rise further in the next financial year as the government will be bringing a total of 533 central payout schemes in 64 ministries under the DBT mechanism by March 31, 2018 as per the directions of PM Narendra Modi,” a top government official told ET.) thanks to Direct Benefit Transfer \(DBT\).
1.1.2.6. Con: Indian money holdings in [Swiss banks](http://www.mydigitalfc.com/plan-and-policy/indians%E2%80%99-money-swiss-banks-increases-50-rs-7000-crore-2017) rose by 50% by 2017.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: Not all [money deposited overseas is illegal money](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/managing-wealth/042916/offshore-banking-isnt-illegal-hiding-it.asp). Only those amounts that have not been taken into account while paying taxes in India are illegal.
1.1.2.6.1.1. Con: Even if all this money was legitimate, the need to look for a foreign bank to hold money is an indication of low confidence in the security of Indian banks.
1.1.2.6.2. Pro: This indicates that many rich people are successfully avoiding tax.
1.1.2.7. Pro: PM Modi has been fighting economic offenders at various levels.
1.1.2.7.1. Con: [The government has failed to produce formal reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/01/31/corruption-is-still-thriving-in-modis-india/?sh=55120fb774be) or data to quantify any of these efforts, such as the number of offenders discovered, or the money recovered.
1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: The idea that PM Modi has been aggressively fighting corruption has been built by Modi-friendly [marketing and media](https://thewire.in/government/corruption-free-india-modi-government-sham-reveals-study-transperancy-international).
1.1.2.7.1.2. Con: Even if the government has not shared formal reports, they've called for [a strong and aligned global cooperation on the return of fugitive economic offenders](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-strong-international-cooperation-fugitive-economic-offenders-jitendra-singh-1811339-2021-06-05).
1.1.2.7.2. Pro: PM Modi has brought much needed [discipline](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/away-from-the-headlines-modi-is-fighting-a-crucial-war-against-inefficient-bureaucracy/articleshow/62277279.cms) [amongst](https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/narendra-modi-biometric-system-central-government-employees-234013-2015-01-04) government employees. This could only have happened by exercising strong will at the very top.
1.1.2.7.3. Pro: Under PM Modi's leadership, India's investigative agencies have been doing their job well, [investigating the acts](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/government-task-force-identifies-16537-confirmed-shell-companies-97000-more-under-scanner/story/278760.html) of crooks and the corrupt.
1.1.2.7.3.1. Con: [Several](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Govt-let-Reddy-bros-have-the-last-laugh-in-15-cases/articleshow/6174661.cms) mining barons of Bellary got the cases against them withdrawn after forging closer ties with BJP.
1.1.2.7.3.2. Pro: [Vijay Mallya's](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/economy/article/vijay-mallya-tired-of-relentless-pursuits-offers-to-settle-dues-worth-rs-13000-crore-to-banks/245991) case is an example of how PM Modi government's has pursued economic offenders and he has taken them to task.
1.1.2.7.3.2.1. Con: PM Modi is protecting corrupt politicians like [B.S. Yediyurappa or Himanta Biswa Sarma](https://theprint.in/opinion/7-politicians-with-corruption-charges-cbi-and-ed-wont-raid/280173/).
1.1.2.7.3.2.2. Pro: In 2018, [Vijay Mallya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Mallya)(Vijay Vittal Mallya \(born 18 December 1955\) is an Indian businessman and former Member of Parliament \(Rajya Sabha\).

1.1.2.7.4. Con: PM Modi was unable to apprehend and prosecute Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who are the accused in a [13,000 crore PNB scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_National_Bank_Scam) and escaped out of India.
1.1.2.7.4.1. Pro: [Nirav Modi was seen with the Prime Minister](http://www.thehindu.com/business/congress-targets-pm-over-davos-photo-with-nirav-modi/article22762831.ece) and other businessmen at the Davos World Economic Forum just a week before a First Information Report \(FIR\) was filed against him.
1.1.2.7.4.2. Con: Nirav Modi, the diamond merchant wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank \(PNB\), was [arrested in London on India’s extradition request](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fugitive-diamantaire-nirav-modi-arrested-in-london-on-india-s-extradition-request/story-1SzhTgfaXZ9JPAVGlIWwOL.html).
1.1.2.7.5. Pro: The entire system that facilitates economic offenders is being [made more accountable](https://www.mid-day.com/articles/axis-bank-officials-agents-arrested-in-rs-360-crore-fraud/19296154).
1.1.2.7.5.1. Pro: Since 2014, [23,000 millionaires have left India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/23000-dollar-millionaires-have-left-india-since-2014/articleshow/63358087.cms) probably due to PM Modi's control of corruption.
1.1.2.7.5.1.1. Pro: A number of millionaires who flew from India are being extradited to India for [financial fraud and money laundering](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/7-indian-billionaires-who-went-from-riches-to-rags/the-king-of-good-times/slideshow/78511276.cms).
1.1.2.7.5.1.2. Con: The loss of so many of India's wealthy has had [negative effects on the economy](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/23000-dollar-millionaires-have-left-india-since-2014/articleshow/63358087.cms), as it has caused less investment and consumption by the super rich.

Con: Senior Congress leader, Prithviraj Chavan, stated that PM Modi's government has been so far the "[most corrupt](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/modi-govt-most-corrupt-its-track-record-abysmal-prithviraj-chavan/articleshow/68861196.cms?from=mdr)" in the history of India, with an "abysmal and deplorable" performance.
1.1.2.7.5.3. Pro: The Modi government passed the [Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018](http://zeenews.india.com/india/noose-tightened-around-nirav-modi-vijay-mallya-as-lok-sabha-passes-fugitive-economic-offenders-bill-2125904.html) which proposed the formation of a special court under the [PMLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Money_Laundering_Act,_2002) to declare a person 'a fugitive economic offender' if they leave the country.
1.1.2.7.5.3.1. Pro: It gives power to the agencies to seize properties which are not only in the name of the offender who left the country to escape the law, but also the ones that are ['benami'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benami_Transactions_\(Prohibition\)_Act,_1988)(The act defines a 'benami' transaction as any transaction in which property is transferred to one person for consideration paid by another person.).
1.1.2.7.5.3.2. Con: Despite the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018, various people accused of economic offenses [have managed to flee due to the failure of the investigating agencies](https://thewire.in/law/the-fugitive-economic-offenders-bill-leaves-a-lot-to-be-desired).
1.1.3. Pro: PM Modi has been systematically removing democratic checks and balances that impact his hold on power.
1.1.3.1. Pro: In order to retain power, PM Modi has acted to ensure that any potential political opposition remains fragmented and thus cannot secure a majority vote.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: In [multiple instances](https://www.altnews.in/fake-news-round-november-2017-bjp-cell-head-amit-malviya-star/), PM Modi has popularized fake news to avoid accountability and retain political power.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Modi's government has posted false statistics on [petrol](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110521549512707) and [diesel](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110636326637568) prices.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The fuel price graph statistics the BJP posted wanted to show that the [percentage increase in fuel prices](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110521549512707) was less than the increase that occurred under the previous government. It was not intended to show that the cost of fuel itself had gone down.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Modi government has since [acknowledged the increase in fuel prices](https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/correct-data-wrong-visualisation-bjps-graph-on-fuel-prices-bharat-bandh/) and promised to take a stand on the issue.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Anyone just seeing the graph would think that it meant fuel prices were lower under PM Modi. While perhaps not a lie, this was still manipulative.
1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Modi's government has shared misleading graphs, because [petrol prices rose 10% since PM Modi assumed office](https://www.firstpost.com/business/fuel-rate-hike-a-fact-check-on-bjps-misleading-graphs-petrol-prices-rose-10-since-narendra-modi-assumed-office-5167911.html).

1.1.3.1.1.4.2. Con: PM Modi's claims have been acknowledged by medical professionals and institutions abroad.
1.1.3.1.1.4.2.1. Con: PM Modi's claim conflates mythology and ancient wisdom with science, which is harmful.

1.1.3.1.1.5. Con: Modi's government has a [fact-checking unit under the Press Information Bureau \(PIB\)](https://theprint.in/india/press-information-bureau-sets-up-fact-checking-unit-to-combat-fake-news-related-to-govt/328248/) to identify and bust misinformation circulating on social media platforms regarding official policies and schemes.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: The BJP is not responsible for opposition losing support from BSP and SP. [Mayawati and Akhilesh blamed Congress](https://youtu.be/zbylEjNxS2U?t=113) for arrogance and gave up the alliance.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: PM Modi has used legal means to split up and diminish rival political parties.
1.1.3.1.3.1.

1.1.3.1.3.3.3. Pro: The BJP, Narendra Modi's party, have been accused of [bribing](http://zeenews.india.com/karnataka/congress-releases-audio-clip-claiming-bjp-tried-to-lure-its-karnataka-mla-2109487.html) Congress members to break from the party so that BJP retain their lead in Karnataka.
1.1.3.1.3.4. Con: PM Modi has justified his decisions by accusing the opposition of ["intellectual dishonesty" and "political deceit" in its criticism of his government](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/intellectual-dishonesty-political-deceit-pm-modi-slams-opposition-bats-for-big-tough-decisions/articleshow/86708411.cms?from=mdr).
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: PM Modi has actively [harmed India's democracy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/18/indias-democracy-is-under-threat/), especially by limiting forms of dissent.
1.1.3.2. Con: It is very common for developing economies \(especially amongst the [BRICS nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS)\) to be oligarchies. India has been one prior to PM Modi.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: India continues to be one of the [most corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronakdesai/2018/03/07/india-continues-to-be-one-of-the-most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world/#1d40a9ea79c6) countries in Asia.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: As per Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) has either improved its ranking or maintained its position. There has been no decline.

1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Between 2014-2017, more than [2.7 lakh crores of loans](https://www.firstpost.com/business/npa-crisis-loans-worth-rs-2-72-lakh-cr-written-off-since-nda-government-took-over-in-2014-just-rs-29000-cr-recovered-4433627.html) from Public Sector Banks were written off.

1.1.3.2.2. Con: [Oligarchies prevent new leaders from emerging and the consolidation of a truly democratic process](https://thewire.in/politics/india-oligarchy-constitution). The fact that India was an oligarchy before PM Modi doesn't prove that he is good for India.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: In comparison to previous leaders, PM Modi's rule is actually less corrupt and oligarchic.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.2.
1.1.3.2.3.2. Con: [75%](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/four-years-of-narendra-modi-government-75-per-cent-of-people-believe-corruption-has-increased) of Indians believe that corruption has gotten worse under Modi.
1.1.3.2.3.3. Con: Overall rates of corruption have arguably [gotten worse](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/604865-modi-s-india-and-khan-s-pakistan-are-rising-in-corruption)(India ranks 80th out of 180 countries listed. That's two notches below the 2018 ranking and four notches down from 2014 when Modi became Prime Minister. Corruption under Prime Minister Modi includes a wave of high-profile scandals that shook his administration during his first term in office. Like a muddy 7.8 billion euro weapons contract to purchase 36 Rafale jet fighters from France. And a $2 billion bank fraud uncovered at India's state-owned Punjab National Bank, this was stated in an article published in foreign newspaper.) in India since PM Modi came to power.
1.1.3.2.4. Con: Much of corruption under PM Modi has been [shocking and unprecedented](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/india-remains-one-most-corrupt-countries-world)(India’s score remained unchanged from last year, but its overall position in the index improved notably compared to years past. Transparency International ranked the world’s largest democracy the 85th and 94th most corrupt country in the world in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nSome may see this as evidence of receding corruption in India.

Pro: The general administrative department of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi [cancelled the appointment of nine advisers](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appointment-of-9-delhi-government-advisors-cancelled-on-mha-recommendation/articleshow/63800453.cms) to various ministers in the Aam Aadmi Party government.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: This was because the creation of posts and their appointments to these posts was supposedly illegal due to a [lack of "prior approval of the central government”](https://theprint.in/opinion/the-modi-govt-hasnt-exactly-upheld-the-spirit-of-federalism-with-its-action-on-aap-posts/50828/).
1.1.3.3.2.2. Con: This case couldn't be considered as an interference by Modi's government, since the posts were "[not valid, all previous orders regarding creation of these posts and appointments made against them \[were\] cancelled.](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/appointment-of-9-advisors-cancelled-on-mha-directions-delhi-govt-118041701260_1.html)"
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: PM Modi has been keen to pass the Right To Information amendment bill, which would give him [greater power](https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/what-makes-rti-amendment-bill-so-controversial-1572596-2019-07-23)(In the 2019 RTI amendment bill, the Narendra Modi government has done away with the fixed tenure of five years for the chief information commissioners and the information commissioners. Their salaries too have been altered.

However, the specific details [have not been disclosed](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-accused-of-illegally-denying-details-on-rti-act/article24187115.ece) to the public.

1.1.3.3.3.2. Con: Specific details were disclosed in 2019 after [the bill was passed](https://prsindia.org/billtrack/the-right-to-information-amendment-bill-2019).

1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The former governor of the Reserve Bank of India [resigned](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46506275) midway through his term; this was seen by many as a form of protest against the Modi government's increasing influence over the Bank.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: The Modi government asked for more than [one third of the total cash reserve of the central bank](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-wants-rs-3-6-lakh-crore-from-rbi-a-third-of-its-reserves-central-bank-says-no-5435504/) despite having spare funds.

1.1.3.4.1.3. Con: In 2021, [PM Modi launched two customer-centric initiatives of the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\)](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-will-expand-scope-of-investment-pm-modi-launches-rbi-s-customer-centric-initiatives-101636696381777.html) to make access to capital market easier and safer to investors.

1.1.3.4.3. Pro: PM Modi has undermined the ability of journalists to hold government accountable by intimidating and threatening them.
1.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: PM Modi is bullying journalists in India, and as a result India's ranking in the World Press Freedom Index has [dropped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-modis-india-journalists-face-bullying-criminal-cases-and-worse/2018/02/13/e8176b72-8695-42ab-abd5-d26aab830d3e_story.html).

1.1.3.4.3.2.2. Con: According to [Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing consent"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent), all big economies, including the US, use their media elite for their own benefit.

1.1.3.4.3.3.1. Con: Although PM Modi has often spoken about the freedom of press, his speech is [empty praise](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/freedom-of-press-modi-presstitude-bjp-16999). The policies and actions of the Modi government are proof that he disregards independent journalism.
1.1.3.4.3.4. Pro: Modi has been undermining the free press.
1.1.3.4.3.4.1. Pro: Recent reports of his government's [contract](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-bought-pegasus-defence-deal-israel-2017-nyt-7746655/) with the NSO to [spy](https://theprint.in/india/pegasus-phones-of-40-journalists-from-indian-express-hindu-ht-wire-tapped-says-report/698393/) on his critics and journalists clearly demonstrate his position as an elected autocrat.

1.1.3.4.4.2.2. Pro: Some people have questions about the [true cause](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/shocking-details-emerge-in-death-of-judge-presiding-over-sohrabuddin-trial-family-breaks-silence) of his death, stating that it can't be a matter of pure coincidence that the ruling judge would die just before the verdict.
1.1.3.4.4.3. Con: PM Narendra Modi has supported India's judiciary for [safeguarding people's rights](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-hails-countrys-judiciary-for-safeguarding-peoples-rights/articleshow/80720581.cms).
1.1.3.4.4.4. Con: The Indian judiciary's impartiality didn’t suddenly decline with PM Modi, because "[it was always broken.](https://scroll.in/article/979369/the-indian-judiciary-didnt-suddenly-decline-in-the-modi-years-it-was-always-broken)"
1.1.3.4.5. Con: PM Modi assured that [the collaboration between industry and institutions](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/collaboration-between-industry-institutions-strengthening-in-india-pm-121010400397_1.html) is being strengthened in India.

1.1.4.3.1. Con: In October 2016, Jay Shah’s company stopped its business activities altogether, declaring that Temple’s net worth had “fully eroded” because of the [loss it posted that year](https://thewire.in/business/amit-shah-narendra-modi-jay-shah-bjp) of Rs 1.4 crore and its losses in earlier years.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: There is no evidence of the government assisting the company in increasing its turnover or evidence of any other corrupt activity regarding the company.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Jay Shah made [Rs 800 million out of Rs 50,000 in three months](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/how-did-amit-shah-s-son-increase-his-fortune-in-few-months-rahul-asks-pm-118021200491_1.html).
1.1.4.4. Con: One of the conglomerates that was accused of being close to PM Modi [has been investigated](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/gautam-adani-dri-authoritys-clean-chit-to-firms-is-illegal-customs-appeal-5060183/) for an overvaluation charge.
1.1.4.5. Con: Vedanta, a company with close links to PM Modi, continues to be hounded and [investigated for mining infractions](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/sterlite-protests-vedanta-environment-law-violations-orissa-tuticorin-zambia).
1.1.4.6. Pro: Piyush Goel, a cabinet minister in Modi's government, has been accused of corruption.
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: Goel sold a company he owned at [nearly 100 times the face value](https://thewire.in/political-economy/in-selling-firm-to-piramal-group-as-minister-piyush-goyal-pushes-ethical-boundaries) to a company that had investments in the power and energy sector, while his job was as the Minister of State in charge of power, coal and energy.
1.1.4.6.2. Con: The accusations were wrong because Goel's [comments had been misinterpreted](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/remark-has-been-misinterpreted-vijay-goel-on-mcd-chor-hai-comment-1479875-2019-03-17).
1.1.5.

1.1.6. Con: [The Transparency International Corruption Perception Index](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/is-india-less-corrupt-or-has-the-nature-of-corruption-changed-984955.html), which measures corruption as perceived by domestic businesspeople in 180 different countries, placed India in 86th rank in 2020, compared to the 94th rank in 2013.
1.2. Pro: Under PM Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished.
1.2.1. Con: The Indian economy has seen several [declining trends](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/asia/india-modi-economy.html) since PM Modi took office.
1.2.1.1. Pro: PM Modi has caused a lot of distress on the [rural economy](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-lok-sabha-2019-elections) and has thus destroyed the informal economy.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: In 2017, the BJP instituted [tight regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/india-rocked-by-protests-meat-industry-tighter-laws) on the nation's meat industry that ultimately created more financial struggles for Dalits and Muslims, both of which rely heavily on the cattle industry and are among India's poorest demographics.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: [PM Modi has been trying to revive the rural economy](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/pm-modi-bets-the-farm-in-a-gamble-to-relaunch-indian-economy-120092400228_1.html). Farmers can now enter five-year, fixed-price contracts with corporate buyers.
1.2.1.2. Pro: [Agriculture exports](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/agrarian-distress-india-short-reading-list?0=ip_login_no_cache%3D473dff6affcbb5a0eb246c9349e01eca) have come down by 21%. At the same time, imports in the same sector have risen by more than 60%.
1.2.1.3. Con: Modi's government revived the previously struggling [highway sector](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JlYQVmRmRpu7ESTqPrkeoO/Infrastructure-in-four-years-of-Modi-govt-A-thumbs-up-for-b.html).
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways introduced the [hybrid annuity model \(HAM\)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3372915), which resulted in a [8% decrease of transportation costs](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JlYQVmRmRpu7ESTqPrkeoO/Infrastructure-in-four-years-of-Modi-govt-A-thumbs-up-for-b.html) and made some industries more competitive against Chinese exports.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Modi government’s highway project in the Himalayas was criticized for being "[built on lies and legal violations.](https://scroll.in/article/972616/special-report-modi-governments-highway-project-in-himalayas-is-built-on-lies-and-legal-violations)"
1.2.1.4. Pro: There was a dramatic increase in [wealth inequality](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/india-wealth-inequality-growing-rapidly-180125084201143.html) in India in 2018.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Growth under PM Modi may exist, but it has been inequitable and only benefited [selected individuals](https://www.oxfamindia.org/Who-is-Reaping-the-Benefits-of-India%E2%80%99s-High-Economic-Growth).
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: PM Modi was awarded the [2018 Seoul Peace Prize](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/prime-minister-modi-awarded-the-seoul-peace-prize-for-2018/story/286285.html) for his implementation of 'Modinomics' and its effect on economic inequality.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: Narendra Modi seems to be one of the selected individuals since [he has been getting richer](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/modis-net-worth-pm-modi-richer-than-last-year-here-s-his-bank-balance-fd-amount-other-details-11632533454605.html).
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: In 2017, [income inequality](https://wid.world/document/chancelpiketty2017widworld/) in India was higher than any time since 1922 \(p. 1\).
1.2.1.4.3. Con: This is a normal side effect of India's economic development. Therefore, it is not the 'fault' of bad policy from PM Modi.
1.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Essentially what it means is that the economy is expanding, and the enterprising actors amass more money. [It is not exactly coming from the poor, as it is made to sound like](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/inequality-myth-and-reality-inequality-in-india-crony-capitalism-5301070/).
1.2.1.4.3.2. Con: If India's economic development suffers from wealth inequality, but PM Modi hasn't managed to decrease this "side effect", then it means that Narendra Modi is not good for India.
1.2.1.4.4. Pro: Through Narendra Modi's time as PM, the Living Family Wage in India has remained almost flat in the [17300-17400 INR](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/01/21/indians-are-worse-off-under-modi/#2a6a379f203b) per month range.
1.2.1.4.4.1. Con: The days of being one of the world's poorest countries are over for India because every minute, [44 people in the country cross the poverty line](https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+samaja+english-epaper-samajen/44+people+coming+out+of+the+poverty+line+every+minute+in+india+report-newsid-91018704). This is the fastest rate of poverty reduction in the world.
1.2.1.4.4.2. Pro: Wages paid to low-skilled labor [decreased to 10300 INR per month in 2017 from 13300 INR per month in 2014](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/01/21/indians-are-worse-off-under-modi/?sh=2b0da21e203b). As a result, many people's quality of life has suffered during the BJP government.
1.2.1.4.5. Con: This is not an effect of [PM Modi's rule](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/02/17/in-india-the-rich-are-getting-richer-but-dont-blame-modi-for-it/?sh=494886e32436). This is a [general](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/18/heres-why-the-rich-do-get-richer.html) [trend](https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/07/21/the-rich-are-becoming-richer/) which happens everywhere in the world.
1.2.1.4.5.1. Con: Definitely the UPA government and earlier NDA government \(NDA-I\) also contributed to this but [PM Modi has worsened it even further](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/oxfam-report-on-growing-inequality-demolished-pm-modis-claims-of-a-new-india).
1.2.1.4.5.2. Pro: According to the UN, in 2020, [rising inequality was affecting more than two-thirds of the globe](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055681).
1.2.1.4.6. Con: Absent clear evidence that this was caused by PM Modi's policies, the fact that this happened during his reign does not prove that he has been responsible for this development.
1.2.1.4.6.1. Pro: The Indian wealth gap and its constant growth is attributed to several factors and cannot be blamed entirely on PM Modi's policies.
1.2.1.4.6.1.1. Con: While India has long suffered from income inequality, [the gap has grown significantly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/02/17/in-india-the-rich-are-getting-richer-but-dont-blame-modi-for-it/#5be6cf292436). It is unlikely that an economic reform from 27 years ago is the cause of this development.
1.2.1.4.6.1.2. Pro: For instance, in 1991, [economic restrictions in India were removed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/02/17/in-india-the-rich-are-getting-richer-but-dont-blame-modi-for-it/#1779ff3e2436), but only the upper classes were able to benefit from the newly created opportunities. This was what initially prompted the significant wealth gap, which has only increased over time.
1.2.1.4.6.2. Con: Nonetheless the government would have the power to reduce the gap. If the gap widens it is either due to no intervention or bad policies.
1.2.1.4.7. Pro: In 2017, the top 1% own about [73%](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/oxfam-india-wealth-report-income-inequality-richests-poor/story/268541.html) of India's wealth - up drastically from a figure of about 58% from 2016.
1.2.1.5. Pro: The value of the Indian Rupee has [increased](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd/USD-to-INR-2014#charts) under PM Modi - it stood at 68.12 Rupees to 1 USD in May 2018, whereas it was as low as 58.47 Rupees to 1 USD in May 2014.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: This has [led](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/forex-reserves-falling-below-400-billion-not-a-worry-say-experts-118073000042_1.html) to dwindling forex reserves.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: A fall in the currency value would be good for India; it would make exports more competitive abroad.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: [Data analysis shows](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-china-exports-most-at-risk-from-currency-strength-in-asia/articleshow/63279701.cms) that the Indian economy is especially receptive to changes in the value of the rupee.
1.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: When the rupee last fell in value in 2012-13, [exports grew at a record setting 12.98%.](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/Vs7sGl77X5xbJANqNJ5oHJ/What-the-future-holds-for-Indian-exports.html)
1.2.1.5.2.3. Con: Export data is mixed: while exports in 2018 [were up compared to 2017](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/india-s-exports-decline-0-7-in-march-2018-118041400312_1.html), they fell in March and the trade deficit was rising faster than exports.
1.2.1.5.3. Con: Currency appreciation is a beneficial development, as it reduces inflation domestically, making goods and services more affordable for consumers. Indian inflation has [fallen since 2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271322/inflation-rate-in-india/).
1.2.1.5.4. Con: An appreciating currency is a sign of [greater investment and consumer and investor confidence](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/whats-behind-the-rebound-in-rupee/articleshow/82965294.cms?from=mdr)(We have had the largest FDI in India \($81 billion in FY21\) and the FPI inflow was also continuous. In FY21, a lot of imports were down because of the lockdown. All of that is getting reflected in rupee. It has definitely outperformed other currencies.) in India.
1.2.1.6. Con: According to a 2021 poll, [87% of Indians were satisfied with the Modi government's handling of the economy](https://www.indiatoday.in/mood-of-the-nation/story/faith-in-modinomics-falters-but-still-strong-at-87-per-cent-finds-motn-poll-1761769-2021-01-22).
1.2.1.6.1. Con: The number of Indians who feel they are ["thriving"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/01/21/indians-are-worse-off-under-modi/#6f677bfe203b) has decreased under the rule of Modi's government.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: [COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the world's economy](https://www.statista.com/topics/6139/covid-19-impact-on-the-global-economy/), which can explain why the majority of Indians are satisfied with PM Modi's handling of economy, despite the declining trends.
1.2.1.7. Pro: Despite PM Modi's promise to increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP, it has [declined](https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/share-of-manufacturing-in-indias-gdp-falling-despite-make-in-india-360521.htm) under his leadership.
1.2.2. Pro: Under PM Modi, India started to become a global economic power.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Under PM Modi, India has focused on creating a [free trade deal](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/india-wants-quick-deal-on-bimstec-free-trade/article9804766.ece) with the [Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal_Initiative_for_Multi-Sectoral_Technical_and_Economic_Cooperation)(The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \(BIMSTEC\) is an international organisation of seven South Asian and Southeast Asian nations, housing 1.73 billion people and having a combined gross domestic product of $3.8 trillion \(2021\). The BIMSTEC member states – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand – are among the countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.).
1.2.2.2. Con: The Modi government has been [manipulating](https://thewire.in/political-economy/why-indias-new-gdp-math-lacks-credibility) numbers to show increased economic growth on papers.
1.2.2.3. Pro: India [is currently the world's fastest growing economy](https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2021/05/11/india-will-be-the-worlds-fastest-growing-major-economy-in-2022-un.html)(India is forecast to grow at 10.1 per cent in 2022, becoming the fastest-growing major economy in the world, the United Nations said on Tuesday, but cautioned that the growth outlook of 2021 was "highly fragile" as the country was the "new hotbed of the pandemic."), and both the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.forbes.com/sites/salvatorebabones/2018/01/02/india-will-outgrow-china-in-2018-but-must-invest-in-next-generation-value-chains/#70c4df3544d8) and the [World Bank](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/world-bank-says-india-has-huge-potential-projects-7-3-growth-in-2018/articleshow/62438949.cms) predict that it will hold onto that title for years to come.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Even [before Narendra Modi became PM](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-likely-to-be-worlds-largest-economy-by-2050-citi/articleshow/7556397.cms), it had been said that India would become the world's largest economy by 2050.
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Given the low levels of resource utilisation in India, it is easy for the country to quickly attain high levels of growth by making better use of excess resources with [existing technologies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/04/21/indias-economy-on-track-to-beat-china/#1343abb51368), regardless of who is Prime Minister.
1.2.2.3.3. Pro: In 2021, under PM Modi, [India moved up to 46th](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-climbs-two-spots-to-rank-46th-in-the-global-innovation-index-2021-121092001312_1.html) on the [Global Innovation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index)(The Global Innovation Index \(GII\) is an annual ranking of countries by their capacity for, and success in, innovation. It is published by the World Intellectual Property Organization, in partnership with other organisations and institutions, and is based on both subjective and objective data derived from several sources, including the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum.), improving from the 60th position in 2017 and 81st in 2015.
1.2.2.3.4. Pro: According to the UN, [India will be the world's fastest growing major economy in 2022](https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2021/05/11/india-will-be-the-worlds-fastest-growing-major-economy-in-2022-un.html).
1.2.2.3.4.1. Pro: In 2021, India was rated the second [fastest-growing major economy](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/gdp-grows-at-8-4-in-q2-india-still-fastest-growing-large-economy-in-world-121120100036_1.html), just behind China.
1.2.2.3.4.2. Con: The growth has been a [jobless growth](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-unemployment-crisis-economic-growth-covid-pandemic-7249627/). Therefore, it is [not benefiting the middle and lower-middle class](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/oIfsn1Djr4KpR1mNNe1zDN/Indias-jobless-growth-is-not-a-myth.html) or the semi-skilled and un-skilled class much.
1.2.2.3.4.3. Pro: [The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-to-be-fastest-growing-economy-in-2022-trips-waiver-necessary-for-vax-unctad/articleshow/86233237.cms) \(UNCTAD\) said that India’s economy is expected to grow 7.2% in 2021.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Under PM Modi's leadership, India overtook France and became the [world's sixth biggest](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-overtakes-france-as-6th-biggest-economy-in-the-world-1282562-2018-07-11) economy in 2018.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: India is the [largest producer](http://vikaspedia.in/agriculture/crop-production/package-of-practices/pulses/pulses-in-india) \(25% of global production\), consumer \(27% of world consumption\) and importer \(14%\) of pulses in the world.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: In 2016, [PM Modi partnered with Mozambique](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modi-returns-africa-visit-kenya-south-africa-mozambique-tanzania-africa-2908322/) to reduce the cost of importing pulses, by signing a pact that included a "long-term agreement" under which India would buy pulses to meet its recurring shortfall and contain prices of the commodity.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Con: Even if India is the largest producer of pulses, [the population growth has outpaced its supply](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/resolving-farm-crisis-assured-procurement-of-pulses-at-msp-101633433775131.html).
1.2.2.4.2. Con: It is also important to look at [GDP per capita](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/country/india-gdp-per-capita.php) \(India is, in 2021, 128th in the world\). In absolute terms, India is ahead of France but it has no relevance to the kind of lives the French lead and the power France enjoys globally.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: In 2020, [Bangladesh surpassed India in GDP per capita](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/10/20/india-falls-behind-bangladesh-gdp/).
1.2.2.4.2.2. Con: Indian [GDP per capita](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-per-capita) has risen under PM Modi.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1. Con: India's GDP \(gross domestic product\) growth fell during the first six months of 2017 from [7% to 5.7%](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/04/news/economy/india-economy-modi-slowdown/index.html), its slowest pace in three years.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: According to the [government's own estimates](https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/analysts-say-modi-s-foreign-investment-reforms-don-t-go-far-enough-1.694513), India’s gross domestic product should grow by 6.5 % through 2017 to the 2018 financial year.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1.2. Con: It takes a long time for governments to enact new policies, thus one cannot expect positive change to happen immediately.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Some policies, like demonetization, can be enacted very quickly and have immediate effect.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Even in [the case of demonetization](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/demonetisation-4-years-on-a-look-at-what-it-achieved-and-didnt-6086571.html), results can only be seen and understood after a certain time.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: There were [some immediate effects of demonetization](https://indianmoney.com/articles/immediate-effects-of-demonetization), such as banks receiving significantly more deposits, the stopping of fake currency, and businessmen being forced to declare their black money.
1.2.2.4.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: India is expected to be one of the top [3 economic powers in the world over the next 10-15 years](https://www.ibef.org/economy/indian-economy-overview) as it is becoming one of the fastest growing major economy in the world.
1.2.2.4.2.2.2. Con: The rise of GDP per capita has nothing to do with PM Modi.
1.2.2.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: India's per capita GDP has [been rising continuously since 1991](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-per-capita). The current GDP growth is, therefore, not solely an achievement of PM Modi's.
1.2.2.4.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: The UPA average was 8.1% GDP growth [as compared](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-clocked-10-08-pc-growth-under-manmohan-singhs-tenure-data-shows/) to the NDA performance at 7.4%.
1.2.2.4.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The [GDP growth under PM Modi was higher](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gdp-under-modi-govt-higher-than-upas-last-four-years-niti-aayog-vc/articleshow/65453384.cms) than UPA's last four years in power.
1.2.2.4.2.2.2.2. Con: In the quarter between April-June 2014, [India recorded the highest GDP growth rate in two and a half years](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/narendra-modi-bjp-govt-seven-years-report-card-economy-jobs-1809996-2021-06-02).
1.2.2.4.2.2.2.3. Pro: Most of the GDP growth happened in states [such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka](https://thelogicalindian.com/story-feed/awareness/gdp-india/) - where Modi's BJP Party isn’t in power - and in south Indian states where domestic production increased.
1.2.2.4.2.2.3. Con: The [method](https://www.firstpost.com/business/revised-gdp-calculation-ministry-of-statistics-says-it-follows-best-international-practices-to-compute-macro-data-4506989.html) of GDP calculation has also been changed. The new series of GDP data is masking a lot of poor growth. The government is also not releasing earlier GDP numbers using the new method.
1.2.2.5. Con: Under PM Modi, [Bangladesh has become a major export rival of India](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57437944).
1.2.2.6. Con: PM Modi has [harmed](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/How-Modi-won-India-s-elections-but-paralyzed-the-economy) several different struggling sectors.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: As BJP promised in its election manifesto, the [minimum support price](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-how-the-1-5-times-formula-for-crops-msp-is-calculated-7075865/) for crops planted by farmers was raised to a minimum of 50% above the production cost.
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: PM Modi is repeating Nehru’s mistake of [self-sufficiency](https://theprint.in/opinion/how-modi-is-repeating-nehrus-mistake-by-evoking-self-sufficiency/633375/).
1.2.2.6.3. Pro: [India’s banking sector](https://scroll.in/article/970701/modi-governments-plan-to-boost-economy-by-squeezing-more-loans-out-of-banks-ignores-a-past-lesson) has been struggling as a result of rising bad loans.
1.2.2.6.4. Con: [The Indian economy](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-economy-recovered-more-strongly-than-it-got-impacted-during-pandemic-modi/article36400869.ece) is strongly recovering after the pandemic.
1.2.3. Pro: India has become an attractive location for investors under PM Modi.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The dollar to INR parity hit the [lowest level ever in history](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-weakening-on-relapsing-macro-vulnerability-will-it-slow-down-growth/articleshow/65073590.cms) in 2018. This was a key campaign issue for the current government.
1.2.3.2. Pro: In 2018, [Google rolled out the world's biggest public WiFi project](https://qz.com/india/1300522/googles-free-wifi-at-railway-stations-is-a-way-of-life-for-8-million-indians/) in Indian railway stations.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: During his visits to foreign countries, PM Modi [met with tech company CEOs and owners](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/NVUME6qX5Oz3WmlA3uqu9O/Narendra-Modi-meets-with-tech-titans-in-Silicon-Valley.html) in order to encourage investments in India.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: [Google ended the free WiFi program station in 2020](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/?guccounter=1) because they couldn't find a sustainable business model to scale the program.
1.2.3.3. Con: [New investments in 2020 were at the lowest](http://www.atimes.com/how-modi-has-failed-as-prime-minister-of-india/) point they had been in the prior 16 years.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Bank credit growth sunk to a [59-year low](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/credit-growth-slowed-to-59-year-low-of-556/article34395966.ece) in 2021, while [loan growth has fallen to 5.1%.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/loan-growth-declines-to-a-62-year-low-of-5-1-rbi-data/articleshow/56389670.cms?from=mdr)
1.2.3.3.2. Con: Foreign direct investment \(FDI\) [increased significantly](https://www.livemint.com/mutual-fund/mf-news/fdi-inflows-in-india-was-higher-than-major-economies-5-reasons-why-11611617341632.html)(Marking a major achievement globally, India recorded a 13% growth in Foreign Direct Investment \(FDI\) in 2020 at a time when fund flows declined most strongly in major economies such as the UK, the US and Russia.) in 2021.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Domestic industries have [remained cautious](https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/why-domestic-investment-remains-slumped-even-though-fdi-is-at-a-record-high-1841182-2021-08-16)(In short, while foreign capital is chasing returns in the tech sector, most Indian corporates remain cautious. Indian firms have little reason to build new capacity—several MSME owners say they are currently running on half capacity because of low demand and high input costs, with corporates also saying that they are sitting on idle capacity. The government would want industry to invest in projects that create economic activity on the ground because this results in jobs and boosts the economy. Over the last 48 months, it has rolled out several measures, including tax rate cuts, to incentivise such investment, but these have not given India Inc the impetus to do so as yet.) and therefore have not significantly increased their investments.
1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: The digital sector, infrastructure, and energy industries have been leading this increase in FDI.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Changes to regulatory laws and policies have made it much easier and more profitable for foreign investment to come to India.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Foreign investors have lost faith in the Modi government. Foreign Portfolio Investor outflows have [hit the highest](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/fpi-outflows-hits-10-year-high-at-48000-cr/article24305873.ece) point since January 2008.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: PM Modi has launched "[Make in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_in_India)(Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to make and encourage companies to manufacture in India and incentivise dedicated investments into manufacturing. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement, and aimed "to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub.)", a policy aimed at attracting more manufacturing and other investments.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Con: Wages in India's manufacturing sector are signficantly [too low](https://qz.com/1064592/the-glaring-problem-keeping-make-in-india-from-attaining-the-success-of-made-in-china/)(The glaring problem keeping “Make in India” from attaining the success of “Made in China” ... In China, average hourly wages for factory workers hit $3.60 in 2016, according to market research firm Euromonitor, which is more than five times the hourly manufacturing wages in India.) to attract the well-trained talent needed to make "Make in India" a success.
1.2.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: Additionally, the unwillingness of companies to offer competitive wage raises and promotions to their employees has led to an increase in ["job-hopping"](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/job-hopping-a-common-trend-among-indian-employees-survey-3425391.html)("The growing trend is more visible amongst the millennial workforce, with 56 percent of respondents having job-hopped in a short duration at least once," the survey added.\n\nAbout 85 percent of those who hopped jobs said that they would add a job to their resume regardless of how long they had stayed in that role.\n\nThe survey said that while job hopping is not a new one, the Indian workforce is seeing a climb in project-based work and contract work, which is fuelling a willingness to switch roles more readily.) across India. This means that even if companies can initially attract well-trained talent, they will have a difficult time keeping it.
1.2.3.4.2.1.2. Con: Manufacturing has the potential t[o provide large-scale employment to the young Indian](https://www.kearney.com/industrial-goods-services/article/?/a/make-in-india-how-manufacturing-in-india-can-become-globally-competitive) population and fight poverty.
1.2.3.4.2.2. Con: Instead of strengthening manufacturing, Modi's government has relied on [protectionist policies](https://qz.com/1200950/modi-risks-undoing-a-generation-of-economic-reforms-in-india-says-economist-arvind-panagariya/) such as higher tariffs. This will only raise prices for Indian consumers and hurt the economy in the long run.
1.2.3.4.2.3. Pro: Given that India's working-age population is being [under-utilised](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/50-indias-working-age-population-out-of-labour-force-says-report/articleshow/67830482.cms), the 'Make in India' policy could help India actually employ and make use of the unrivaled number of potential labor in the country.
1.2.3.4.2.3.1. Con: India was ranked [103](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-human-capital-index-india-ranks-103-also-among-lowest-in-the-world-in-employment-gender-gap/story-aXsXGaNjtGmxG6Z90JaNcJ.html) on the World Economic Forum's Global Human Capital Index.
1.2.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: India is [expected](https://populyst.net/2015/09/25/working-age-population-around-the-world-1960-2050/) to have the largest working age population in the world by 2050.
1.2.3.4.2.4. Pro: As of May 2017, the initiative started to yield results: The number of industrial projects set up in India, foreign direct investments, and merchandise exports had [all begun to rise](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/xaNsPPwllWVOR9k3MJBQKJ/Is-Make-in-India-beginning-to-bear-fruit.html).
1.2.3.4.2.4.1. Pro: Foreign Direct Investment \(FDI\) to India’s manufacturing sector [grew by 82%](http://www.thehindu.com/business/jobs-impact-of-make-in-india-under-review/article17616497.ece) between April and November 2016.
1.2.3.4.2.4.2. Con: Statistics finding that FDI has risen may falsely include [round-tripping investments](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/experts-question-success-of-make-in-india-campaign/articleshow/56559087.cms), i.e. money that has left India for another country \(often a tax haven\) and then come back as "foreign" investment.
1.2.3.4.2.4.3. Pro: "Make In India" has secured a boost in the defense sector where major defense aircrafts are to [be manufactured in India](https://swarajyamag.com/economy/make-in-india-is-on-track-with-win-win-partnerships-in-the-defence-sector-under-discussion) and the knowledge shared for indigenous manufacturing of such aircrafts in the future.
1.2.3.4.2.4.4. Con: India has [lost](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/in-textiles-we-have-lost-the-race-to-bangladesh-vietnam-and-cambodia-ajay-bagga-market-expert/articleshow/52851921.cms) a significant amount of its market share in the textile industry to Bangladesh. The FDI inflow to textiles has been a lot lower than what it should have been.
1.2.3.4.2.5. Con: Foreign Direct Investment share as percentage of GDP has been declining since 2015 and is a long way behind the [best of 3.6%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.KLT.DINV.WD.GD.ZS?end=2016&locations=IN&start=2005) during the UPA rule.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: India has relaxed foreign investment rules on [aviation, retail and construction.](https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/analysts-say-modi-s-foreign-investment-reforms-don-t-go-far-enough-1.694513) This has allowed for greater investment to be made in these industries.
1.2.3.4.4. Con: The measure of investment in any economy, Gross Fixed Capital Formation \(GFCF\), has been [declining sharply](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gross-fixed-capital-formation-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html) since 2012. The Modi government has done little to halt this trend.
1.2.3.4.5. Pro: India rose from 130th to 100th place in the World Bank's 2017 ["Ease of Doing Business"](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings?region=south-asia) rankings, and to [77th](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/01/world-bank-india-improves-ease-of-doing-business.html) in the 2019 report, which is encouraging for potential investors.
1.2.3.4.5.1. Con: The World Bank's [Ease of Doing Business](https://www.makeinindia.com/eodb) rankings do not represent the ground realities. They are based on a very subjective survey of the 'opinions' of a tiny segment of people which cannot represent the ease of doing business in the whole of India. This is all just a marketing stunt.
1.2.3.4.5.2. Pro: Under Modi's rule, India has gone from [44th to 36th](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/india-jumps-8-places-in-international-intellectual-property-index/1480901/) on the International Intellectual Property \(IP\) Index which analyses the IP climate in 50 world economies.
1.2.3.4.5.3. Con: The metrics for the ranking have been calculated using data from [Mumbai and Delhi alone](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india), so it's not representative of the entire country.
1.2.3.4.5.4. Pro: The World Bank credited [decisions](https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/the-ease-of-doing-business-in-india/) made by Modi's government, including an injection of $32 billion into public sector banks to encourage infrastructure investments, introducing reforms in key areas, the protection of minority shareholders' interests, and the simplification of the taxation process, with India's rise in the rankings.
1.2.3.5. Con: Under PM Modi, [investors sold $4.5 billion of Indian shares in 2019](https://theprint.in/economy/modi-euphoria-gone-foreign-investors-dump-record-4-5-billion-of-indian-shares-in-3-months/292527/). This was considered the biggest exodus since at least 1999.
1.2.4. Con: The way the government implemented its [Goods and Services Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_\(India\)) \(GST\) has been bad for the economy.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The closure of businesses as a result of the Goods and Services tax has eliminated about [1.5 million](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/good-bad-and-ugly-of-indias-new-national-sales-tax-journey/articleshow/59748765.cms) jobs.
1.2.4.2. Pro: There has been a declining [trend](https://www.firstpost.com/business/revised-gdp-calculation-ministry-of-statistics-says-it-follows-best-international-practices-to-compute-macro-data-4506989.html) in exports & services compared to GDP.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: [45% of India's exports come from SMEs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/policy-trends/smes-employ-close-to-40-of-indias-workforce-but-contribute-only-17-to-gdp/articleshow/20496337.cms?from=mdr). SMEs' have been made to suffer through an ill-conceived demonetisation act and a haphazard GST implementation.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: [According to data from World Bank](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/IND), the world's growth, as well as India's growth and the Indian GDP have also been declining.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Overall, the new Modi tax regime has brought in enormous complexity as opposed to [the simplicity the government promised](https://www.ndtv.com/business/thanks-bureaucrats-gst-been-turned-into-an-absolute-mess-foreign-media-1622173).
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Comparing with other countries is not a fair evaluation. India is more populous than any other country in the world.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: Tax, economy and political reforms are always compared worldwide. Adopting an inward looking mindset is not apt for India.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: [India's population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/) is equivalent to 17.7% of the [total world population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: When in opposition, the BJP [opposed](https://www.governancenow.com/news/regular-story/-recalling-a-time-when-bjp-opposed-gst--) Goods and Services Tax \(GST\); when in power they implemented it. The BJP has generally been very inconsistent and undermined their previous commitments when it comes to the issue of GST.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: In 2011 GST had known shortcomings that were addressed in [2014 Constitutional Bill \(122nd Amendment\)](https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/government/comparison-of-goods-and-services-tax-bill-under-upa-ii-and-nda). New amendments made the process more democratic.
1.2.4.3.2.2. Pro: Even though PM Modi launched GST into operation on the 1st of July 2017, the concept was first proposed [under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government two decades ago](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjN9ti8_5z0AhXDPOwKHWgABqIQFnoECBsQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financialexpress.com%2Fwhat-is%2Fgoods-and-services-tax-gst-meaning%2F1620322%2F&usg=AOvVaw0yyzNgFXfO31YCatGvjxsb).
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: India now has five [Goods and Services Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_\(India\)) rates. Of the [115 countries](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/fStxh8vE5vQCW7V1hq1hOK/Simple-rules-for-a-complex-world-GST-classification.html) with GST regimes, 40 countries use a single rate and 28 countries use two rates.
1.2.4.4. Con: The International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) concluded that PM Modi's Goods and Services tax and currency exchange initiatives were [important sources](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/04/21/indias-economy-on-track-to-beat-china/#1343abb51368) of this economic growth, which means his leadership of the country was directly responsible for the positive developments.
1.2.5. Pro: Introducing a new [insolvency and bankruptcy code](https://www.opindia.com/2018/05/why-modi-government-deserves-huge-applause-for-the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code/) to address the issue of the [Non-Performing Assets](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/non-performing-assets-in-indian-banks/) has been an achievement of the government.
1.2.5.1. Con: The cases referred to IBC have hardly had any tangible effect. In fact, to the contrary, the government has announced an infusion of [2.11 lakh crores](https://www.firstpost.com/business/rs-2-11-lakh-crore-recapitalisation-package-will-also-strengthen-psu-banks-balance-sheets-urjit-patel-4245783.html) to the public sector banks.
1.2.5.2. Con: Only [two major cases](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/npa-fix-only-2-from-rbis-dirty-dozen-resolved-under-ibc-what-about-others-is-the-delay-hurting/1160770/) have been solved by IBC \(Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code\).
1.2.5.3. Pro: PM Modi recalled that the previous government had tried to hide the NPAs accumulated during their regime, while he ensured [a return of nearly Rs 3 lakh crore into the system with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code \(IBC\)](https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/republic-summit-2019/pm-modi-highlights-success-of-ibc-in-solving-npa-problem.html).
1.2.6. Con: Demonetisation negatively impacted the economy.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Demonetisation made it difficult for many Indians to access their own savings, which decreased [trust in banks](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/rpdrmaTifLZkmIvpDeVs0O/Unintended-consequences-of-demonetisation.html).
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes made up 86% of all cash in circulation so the government and the Reserve Bank of India had to constantly alter the rules to address unforeseen situations with [Modi's demonetisation.](https://scroll.in/article/909545/the-modi-years-what-did-demonetisation-achieve)
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Demonetisation helped many Indians [to get home loans at significantly lower rates](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/demonetisation-five-compelling-reasons-for-consumers-to-invest-in-real-estate-market-3128332.html).
1.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.
1.2.6.3. Con: The increased transparency in the purchase and payment system of property in India has led to a [boost](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) in consumer confidence.
1.2.6.4. Con: Demonetization has led to a [reduction](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) in the interest rate on home loans. This has attracted investment in property, resulting in an increased demand for real estate, and has made it easier for people to afford housing.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: The government policy of demonetization has had a negative impact on India's real estate sector.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Pro: Demonetization has [harmed many start ups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/krnkashyap/2016/12/15/how-indias-demonetization-is-affecting-its-startups/#50223276f2c2) across the country, causing the vibrant start up environment in India to suffer a huge set back.
1.2.6.4.1.2. Pro: In 2017, the [purchase](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) of new property fell by up to 40% in major cities, while new project announcements fell by 11% immediately after demonetization.
1.2.6.4.1.3. Pro: [Construction firms](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) which dealt in cash were unable to meet their operational expenses, like wages and raw materials, as a result of demonetization. Consequently, most of the under-construction projects came to a standstill.
1.2.6.4.1.3.1. Con: The lower interest rate scheme as a result of demonetization has [benefited](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) property builders, allowing them to resume their projects which were previously discontinued due to a lack of funds.
1.2.6.4.1.3.2. Pro: The construction sector was negatively affected by demonetization because [construction workers are typically paid in cash on a daily basis](https://thewire.in/economy/how-demonetisation-impacted-construction-workers).
1.2.6.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.2.6.4.1.5. Con: The performance of real estate firms on the stock market Bombay Stock Exchange \(BSE\) [improved](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) by 50% during 2016-17.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: The Indian real estate sector attracted a record high foreign investment of [$5.7 billion](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) in 2016.
1.2.6.5. Pro: Demonetization was poorly implemented.
1.2.6.5.1. Pro: The decision to implement demonetization was taken by PM Modi alone. He did not even consult the [Governor of the Reserve Bank of India](https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-raghuram-rajan-slams-demonetization-says-modi-government-did-not-consult-rbi-over-decision-2542598), despite the fact that his role would have been crucial to a successful implementation of the policy.
1.2.6.5.2. Con: During 2017-18, demonetization [had a positive impact](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-3-years-on-a-look-at-impact-on-key-sectors-of-the-economy-119110701482_1.html) on the [widening of the tax base](https://mybs.in/2X5Cw9s).
1.2.6.5.3. Con: [Demonetization has been called a success](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/demonetisation-what-india-gained-and-lost-1327502-2018-08-30) because the currency in the system after the implementation was 87-88% "that is, about Rs 3-4 lakh crore less currency than it would have been if the system would have continued in the old manner."
1.2.6.5.3.1. Con: The way demonetisation was implemented actually [incentivised hoarding](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/rpdrmaTifLZkmIvpDeVs0O/Unintended-consequences-of-demonetisation.html) since the government failed to quickly start circulating the new Rs 500 notes. This deprived many parts of the economy of much needed cash inflow.
1.2.6.5.3.2. Pro: The demonetisation push in 2016 served as a [significant push](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/how-technology-is-opening-up-the-gates-of-bigger-opportunities-for-india/articleshow/63905947.cms) in the direction for digital transformation, and accelerated the use of apps for digital payments.
1.2.6.5.4. Pro: Indians were forced out of their homes to stand in long ATM queues during [the 2016 demonetisation](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/demonetisation-queues-get-longer-at-banks-atms/article9340818.ece) and were limited from even taking their own white money out of ATMs.
1.2.6.5.4.1. Pro: People spent hours [waiting at ATMs](http://www.atimes.com/indias-demonitization-policy-fails-address-real-problems/) to withdraw money and thus wasted valuable working hours.
1.2.6.5.4.2. Con: A one time inconvenience does not have any significant impact on quality of life. This lengthy queueing only lasted for a short period of a few months in 2016.
1.2.7. Con: PM Modi is failing to implement promised measures to address the [current Indian unemployment crisis.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-has-an-unemployment-crisis-and-it-predates-covid19-101629287437935.html)
1.2.7.1. Con: Modi's government has funded schemes to fight unemployment with self-employment.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: With schemes like the Mudra scheme, Stand Up India and Startup India, the Modi government has helped create [5.1 million new entrepreneurs](https://www.businesstoday.in/jobs/story/pm-mudra-loans-created-5-1-million-new-entrepreneurs-created-11-2-million-new-jobs-237376-2019-11-07).
1.2.7.1.2. Con: Self-employment is still [precarious in India](https://brill.com/view/journals/jlso/24/1/article-p133_133.xml?language=en).
1.2.7.2. Con: Modi helped open the [world's largest mobile phone factory](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/09/technology/samsung-india-biggest-factory-noida-smartphone/index.html) in India, bringing in new jobs.
1.2.7.3. Pro: Instead of focusing on job creation, the focus has been on [showing stats](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-govt-indian-economy-demonetisation-gst-job-loss-unemployment-5178184/) on job creation, which professors called "number jugglery".
1.2.7.4. Pro: There are currently 412,752 [government job vacancies](https://qz.com/1202121/jobs-crisis-the-modi-government-is-sitting-on-more-than-400000-vacancies/) which Modi's government have neglected to fill, which makes the unemployment rate larger than is necessary.
1.2.7.4.1. Con: Filling all these jobs would provide jobs to [less than 2%](https://qz.com/1216899/indias-unemployment-climbs-to-7-at-31-million-and-is-set-to-worsen/) of the unemployed in India, so it wouldn't have any meaningful impact.
1.2.7.5. Pro: In 2014, PM Modi promised to create [10 million](https://qz.com/1269188/the-modi-government-just-cant-figure-out-how-many-jobs-it-has-created/) jobs if elected. He has failed to achieve this, with reports claiming his government has created 3.11 million jobs.
1.2.7.6. Con: [EPFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employees%27_Provident_Fund_Organisation)(The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation \(EPFO\) is the social security body under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India that is responsible for regulation and management of provident funds, pensions and the mandatory life insurance in India.) data showed that [3.1 million new jobs](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/epfo-data-3-1-million-new-jobs-employment-created-between-september-february/story/275633.html) were created between September 2017 and February 2018.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: This is the first time EPFO data has been compiled for stats on job creation. The [3.1 million jobs](https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/forcing-conclusions-upon-the-epfo-data/1147335/) added is a number which reflects existing jobs \(jobs that already existed but were just registered under the EPFO\) and new jobs.
1.2.7.7. Pro: Several of PM Modi's policies have actually caused large and quick increases in unemployment.
1.2.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.2.7.7.2. Con: Much of PM Modi's economic policy has sought to [change the structure of the economy](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Modi-s-structural-reforms-enter-climax-as-vested-interests-dig-in)(The coming measures address complex and draconian labor and agriculture regulations as well as resource-wasting state-owned enterprises -- leftovers of the socialist economic regime installed mainly by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and his daughter and third prime minister, Indira Gandhi, during the four decades after 1947.). While this may have short-term job losses, those will be rectified under a more efficient system.
1.2.7.7.3. Pro: [Over 1.5 million jobs were lost](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/demonetisation-effect-15-million-jobs-lost-in-first-4-months-of-the-year/65815) in just the first four months post-demonetization.
1.2.8. Pro: Under PM Modi's leadership, [inflation](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/from-11-to-2-2-five-charts-explain-vanishing-india-inflation/articleshow/59227745.cms) has remained in check.
1.2.8.1. Con: PM Modi promised that the government would take strict measures to check rising prices and would set up [special courts](https://www.indiatoday.in/4-years-of-modi-government/story/after-4-years-here-are-the-promises-modi-govt-could-not-keep-1242120-2018-05-26) to stop hoarding and black marketing. However, no special courts have been set up so far.
1.2.8.2. Pro: Inflation has been [decreasing](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi) ever since Narendra Modi was elected as Prime Minister in 2014.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: Inflation remained low due to low oil prices in 2015 and 2016. With oil prices rising, inflation is expected to [continue increasing](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2018/05/14/india-cpi-inflation-rises-to-458-in-april).
1.2.8.2.1.1. Pro: The [RBI also raised](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rising-oil-prices-to-hit-private-consumption-says-urjit-patel/article24213062.ece) the repo rate because of oil prices.
1.2.8.2.1.2. Pro: In May 2021, India’s [retail rate of inflation](http://www.mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/press_release/CPI%20Press%20Release%20May2021.pdf), measured year-on-year, [was 6.3%](https://scroll.in/article/999644/controlling-inflation-has-been-one-of-modi-s-biggest-successes-but-is-it-faltering-now). Rural inflation \(6.48%\) was higher than urban \(6.04%\).
1.2.8.2.1.3. Con: Even if inflation continues increasing, there are also [rising inflation concerns in other countries and big economies,](https://www.livemint.com/) as a direct result of the pandemic.
1.2.8.2.1.4. Con: Given the [large foreign exchange reserves buffer that the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) has built over the end of March 2019 and the end of March 2021](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/india-wont-go-down-the-slippery-slope-if-crude-prices-rise-heres-why/articleshow/81576583.cms?from=mdr), even if the oil prices continue rising, inflation might not be problematic.
1.2.8.2.2. Pro: Modi's government has handled inflation [better than any government in the past two decades](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/modi-1-0-steady-gdp-growth-low-inflation-have-left-economy-in-good-shape-119040201333_1.html).
1.2.8.3. Con: India's low levels of inflation are [not a completely positive development](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/low-india-inflation-a-double-edged-sword-for-narendra-modi-before-polls-119031201057_1.html).
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: If inflation is [too low](http://time.com/money/3749245/low-inflation-bad/), this can actually harm the economy.
1.2.8.3.2. Con: Low inflation ensures that the costs of [essential goods and services remain stable](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-low-inflation-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-1563336255108.html) and affordable.
1.3. Pro: PM Modi has improved [India's infrastructure](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JlYQVmRmRpu7ESTqPrkeoO/Infrastructure-in-four-years-of-Modi-govt-A-thumbs-up-for-b.html).
1.3.1. Pro: Under PM Modi, India launched in 2014 the "[Swachh Bharat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swachh_Bharat_Abhiyan)(Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or Clean India Mission is a country-wide campaign initiated by the Government of India in 2014 to eliminate open defecation and improve solid waste management. It is a restructured version of the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan launched in 2009 that failed to achieve its intended targets)" \(Clean India\) scheme.
1.3.1.1. Con: The Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, which PM Modi has claimed as his own idea, was actually [floated by UPA](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/modis-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-nothing-new-upa-scheme-says-chidambaram-1740661.html).
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Execution is what matters and positive impact has been felt in the [medical waste area](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Swachh-Bharat-Abhiyan-shows-its-impact-in-medical-field/articleshow/49275813.cms).
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The Congress critized Modi's government for ['hijacking' its schemes and 'rechristening' them](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/swachh-bharat-repackaged-initiative-of-upa-government-manmohan-singh-705582).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Swachh Bharat has had many success stories, even if they are [under-reported](https://yourstory.com/2018/01/swachh-bharat-success-stories/) by the media.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The government didn't take any steps to let independent bodies publish reports on the progress of Swachh Bharat.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: A [sanctioned loan](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/25-years-swachh-bharat-missions-claims-remain-unverified-62556) \(due from July 2016\) from World Bank was not mentioned in the media because [the government was scared](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/world-bank-yet-to-release-fund-for-swachh-bharat/articleshow/56429289.cms) to let an independent body track the progress of the project.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: More than [50% of the fund](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/50-of-swachh-bharat-funds-remains-unused/article22699365.ece/amp/) for the scheme remained unused in 2018.
1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: [According to the 'WASH report 2021'](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/rural-water-and-sanitation/is-india-really-open-defecation-free-here-s-what-numbers-say-77918), only 15% of the total population in India defecates in the open.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: [UNICEF has shared the government's report](https://www.unicef.org/india/what-we-do/ending-open-defecation) on the progress of Swacch Bharat, which shows that their reports might be reliable.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: [This initiative has since been a success](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/data-stories/data-focus/flush-with-success-swachh-bharat-scheme-on-path-to-sustainability/article33686833.ece). It has cleaned up Indian cities and rural areas, and reduced instances of defecation or throwing garbage on the street.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Many countries that are economically worse off than India are [better in regards to](https://theprint.in/opinion/bangladesh-and-tanzania-have-a-lesson-or-two-for-india-on-open-defecation/99275/) open defecation. Bangladesh is 95% open defecation free.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Under the initiative, over [100 million household toilets](https://sbm.gov.in/sbmdashboard/) were constructed [benefiting 500 million people across 630,000 villages](https://www.unicef.org/india/what-we-do/ending-open-defecation).
1.3.2. Pro: PM Modi has used technology for the benefit of the nation.
1.3.2.1. Pro: PM Modi has begun the [usage of AI and Blockchain technology in agriculture](https://inc42.com/buzz/pm-modi-pitches-for-usage-of-ai-and-blockchain-in-agriculture/) to boost farming.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Modi's government has successfully made use of the [Aadhaar biometric ID system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar)(Aadhaar \(English: foundation or base\) is a 12-digit unique identity number that can be obtained voluntarily by citizens of India, non-residents passport holders of India and resident foreign nationals who have spent over 182 days in twelve months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment, based on their biometric and demographic data.).
1.3.2.2.1. Con: When in opposition, the [BJP called Aadhaar a fraud scheme](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-flip-flop-when-the-bjp-called-it-a-fraud-scheme-aimed-at-legalising-illegal-immigrants/story-tRxUVr8qTDbPHwInD7m3tN.html) aimed at legalising illegal immigrants.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The [Modi government later accepted that Aadhaar was a great initiative of the Congress regime](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-admits-aadhaar-was-great-initiative-of-congress-regime/story-kkkwSeNMhCmHSNbvJoaI9I.html) and then took on the idea as their own.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: When the BJP was in opposition, it did not allow the [Congress-led UPA’s UIDAI bill](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-flip-flop-when-the-bjp-called-it-a-fraud-scheme-aimed-at-legalising-illegal-immigrants/story-tRxUVr8qTDbPHwInD7m3tN.html), which aimed to give statutory backing to the Unique Identity scheme, to be passed in Parliament.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: In 2021, [99% of the Indian adult population](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/big-boost-for-uidai-today-99-of-indian-adult-population-holds-aadhaar-card-11624939991372.html) had an Aadhaar card.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: The [Aadhaar system](https://uidai.gov.in/286-faqs/your-aadhaar/aadhaar-features-eligibility/1934-what-are-the-features-and-benefits-of-aadhaar.html) is intended to improve privacy, transparency, and inclusion throughout India.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: The Aadhaar system is not secure, there have been [numerous leaks](https://www.financialexpress.com/aadhaar-card/trai-chiefs-aadhar-challenge-decoded-why-r-s-sharma-gave-out-his-aadhar-number/1264177/).
1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: According to the same article [cited above](https://www.financialexpress.com/aadhar-card/trai-chiefs-aadhar-challenge-decoded-why-r-s-sharma-gave-out-his-aadhar-number/1264177/), Mr Sharma and UIDAI said that no servers were hacked and that the only information challengers found was what others could have obtained with a simple Google search.
1.3.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: Aadhaar put the private information of billions of citizens at risk when UIDAI’s Aadhaar software [was hacked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hacker-shows-cops-how-he-got-aadhaar-data/articleshow/59936606.cms).
1.3.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: The [TRAI chief's](https://www.financialexpress.com/aadhar-card/trai-chiefs-aadhar-challenge-decoded-why-r-s-sharma-gave-out-his-aadhar-number/1264177/) details got hacked after he opened a challenge to hackers by revealing his Aadhaar number.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Pro: Unlike previous ID systems, Aadhaar seeks to legitimize and empower as many people as possible by ensuring that every resident is able to secure an ID number regardless of demographics.
1.3.2.2.3.2.1. Con: [The Aadhaar card, a unique identifier linked to all services, enabled government surveillance](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/aadhaar-enabling-a-form-of-supersurveillance/article22444686.ece) by creating a 360 degree profile of the person.
1.3.2.2.3.2.2. Con: According to a [2021 report](https://www.editorji.com/story/report-aadhaar-excludes-transgenders-homeless-citizens-1574863154226), 90% of the population in Assam, "where 19 lakh people were declared illegal residents in August \[2021\]" didn't have an Aadhar card.
1.3.2.2.3.2.3. Pro: Prior to the introduction of Aadhaar numbers, IDs were often issued on a household basis and typically [only included](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) a photo of the head of the household.
1.3.2.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: This meant that dependents did not have their own individual ID, which consequently singled out women and children.
1.3.2.2.3.2.3.2. Con: Aadhaar has made it harder for [Indian women to access their maternity benefit](https://scroll.in/pulse/945587/how-aadhaar-is-making-it-harder-for-indian-women-to-access-their-maternity-benefits)s, because they need both the mother and father's Aadhaar number.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4. Pro: Aadhaar numbers are [free](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/), meaning that those living below the poverty line can acquire an ID with significantly more ease than under previous ID systems.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4.1. Con: In 2019, [30% of homeless people in India](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/30-of-homeless-27-of-third-gender-residents-don-t-have-aadhaar-report-119112501547_1.html) didn't have an Aadhaar number.
1.3.2.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: Enrollment for Aadhaar [includes](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) transgender as an option, it does not require proof of address in case an applicant is homeless, and it does not ask women to provide their husband's or father's name.
1.3.2.2.3.3. Pro: The Aadhaar system has eliminated much of the corruption and fraud that plagued other ID systems in India.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1. Con: The Aadhaar system has had many errors that have resulted in increased difficulties for Indians to [access welfare schemes](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/aadhaar-failures-food-services-welfare).
1.3.2.2.3.3.2. Con: There have been [public cases of corruption](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/adg-of-uidai-arrested-for-taking-bribe-in-delhi-office/articleshow/78773185.cms?from=mdr) connected to the Aadhaar system.
1.3.2.2.3.3.3. Pro: Prior to the Aadhaar system, acquiring an ID often involved paying [hefty bribes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-18141584) to state offices; something that many impoverished residents could not afford to do.
1.3.2.2.3.3.4. Pro: By [introducing](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) virtual IDs and mandatory tokenization, [the UIDAI](https://uidai.gov.in/) has helped improve security and protect user privacy.
1.3.2.2.3.3.4.1. Con: Virtual IDs are a threat to user privacy because an individual's activities across multiple domains of service [could potentially be tracked](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/the-truth-about-security-here-s-why-aadhaar-s-greatest-threat-lies-within-118011700061_1.html) using their Aadhaar IDs.
1.3.2.2.3.3.4.2. Pro: By using biometric and demographic data to assign residents Aadhaar numbers, it is [significantly more difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar#Fraud) than ever before to either duplicate an existing ID or create a false one using fake records.
1.3.2.2.3.3.4.2.1. Pro: Using Aadhaar, the government cancelled 3 crore of fake, duplicate ration cards in 2018, [saving Rs 17000 crore](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/aadhaar-helped-cancel-3-crore-fake-duplicate-ration-cards-minister/articleshow/63082030.cms).
1.3.2.2.3.3.4.2.2. Pro: Partly by using Aadhaar, the government managed to disqualify [3 Lakh fake directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html).
1.3.2.2.3.3.4.2.3. Con: [Fake Aadhaar enrollment centers](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fake-aadhaar-enrolment-centre-uncovered-in-ludhiana-three-held-101627844124266.html) have been uncovered since the introduction of the system.
1.3.2.2.3.3.4.2.4. Con: The Unique Identification Authority of India \(UIDAI\) has warned Indians that "[not all 12-digit numbers are Aadhaar](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-to-check-whether-aadhaar-card-is-genuine-or-fake-here-s-how-to-do-it-101629638964861.html)" and they have adviced to check if their Aadhaar card is genuine.
1.3.2.2.3.4. Con: The Aadhaar system has only led to the loss of privacy of Indian citizens.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1. Pro: The government forced residents to link their unique Aadhaar number to many aspects of their lives until the Supreme Court intervened and [extended the deadlines](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-indefinitely-extends-deadline-for-linking-mobile-phones-passports-new-bank-accounts/article23214939.ece) indefinitely.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Modi's government actually [shied](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-link-aadhaar-with-voter-id-ravi-shankar-prasad/articleshow/63572290.cms) away from linking the voter ID to the Aadhaar card.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: This could help combat persistent issues such as phantom or duplicate votes and it shows that the government is [not interested in real accountability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5741784/), but only in controlling its citizens.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.1.2. Con: The idea of linking Aadhaar with voter IDs was to [enable remote voting](https://theprint.in/india/modi-govt-tells-ec-it-will-amend-laws-to-link-aadhaar-with-voter-ids-to-enable-remote-voting/367670/).
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: Such surveillance may lead to less political opposition and more fear among everyday citizens.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3. Con: Creating a unique identifier and maintaining a database does not qualify as surveillance and is far from turning towards a surveillance state.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: Many other developed countries have a similar unique identifier for citizens that links to all services because linking information is just a step in the evolution of government services.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3.1.1. Con: It has been argued that [robust democracies are less likely to have biometric identity systems](https://scroll.in/article/851282/are-countries-with-a-poor-democratic-record-more-likely-to-mandate-an-aadhaar-like-id).
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: The US has a system of [Social Security numbers](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/) which are also unique identifiers linked with many public and private services.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3.1.2.1. Con: India's is different from the US' system in two aspects. There is no biometric data associated with it and there is a [privacy law](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974) regulating its usage.
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: American Social Security numbers are [linked to healthcare](https://www.verywellhealth.com/why-does-my-doctor-need-my-social-security-number-2614958).
1.3.2.2.3.4.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.2.1.
1.3.2.2.3.4.2. Pro: The computer security specialist [Edward Snowden](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-uidai-not-scribe-for-aadhaar-breach-snowden/articleshow/62436393.cms) stated that the Aadhaar system violated the privacy of billion of Indians.
1.3.2.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: [The Aadhaar system data of over 1 billion users has been reportedly sold for merely Rs 500](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details/523361.html).
1.3.2.2.3.4.2.2. Pro: A [French hacker hacked the Aadhaar system multiple times just](https://scroll.in/magazine/872352/who-is-elliot-alderson-the-vigilante-hacker-taking-down-uidai-one-tweet-at-a-time) to show how insecure it was.
1.3.2.2.3.4.2.3. Con: [UIDAI constantly upgrades and reviews its security systems](https://uidai.gov.in/1024-faqs/aadhaar-online-services/order-aadhaar-pvc-card-online/12505-what-are-the-security-features-of-%E2%80%9Caadhaar-pvc-card%E2%80%9D.html) and safety mechanisms to make Aadhaar more secure.
1.3.2.2.3.4.3. Con: Contrary to popular belief, the Aadhaar linking system is a [one-way process](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) done only for the purpose of authentication.
1.3.2.2.3.4.3.1. Con: Even if systems just retain authentication data, it can lead to the [misuse of data](https://www.financialexpress.com/aadhaar-card/aadhaar-authentication-data-cant-be-retained-beyond-6-months-says-supreme-court/1328066/).
1.3.2.2.3.4.3.2. Pro: [The UIDAI](https://uidai.gov.in/)(\(Unique Identification authority of India\)) also does not receive any data regarding where or why someone's Aadhaar number was used, but simply that it was used as a means of authenticating their identity.
1.3.2.2.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: This means that linking to a bank account, for example, would provide the bank with one's Aadhaar number but the UIDAI would receive [no data from the bank in return](https://uidai.gov.in/contact-support/have-any-question/281-faqs/your-aadhaar/use-aadhaar-freely/1873-does-linking-my-bank-account,-pan,-and-other-services-with-aadhaar-make-me-vulnerable.html).
1.3.2.2.3.4.3.2.2. Con: Even if the [UIDAI just receives basic data](https://uidai.gov.in/290-faqs/your-aadhaar/protection-of-the-individual-in-the-uidai-system/1945-how-does-the-uidai-protect-the-individual-and-their-information.html) from the Aadhaar number, they still receive personal data they need to protect.

1.4.4.4.1.4. Pro: In 2015, Modi's government pledged [$1 billion](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/india-announces-1-billion-aid-for-rebuilding-nepal/98435.html) in assistance to earthquake-ravaged Nepal for its reconstruction programme which ensured that the country got back to its feet relatively quickly.
1.4.4.4.1.4.1. Pro: The Nepalese government publicly thanked the Modi administration for its "[tremendous assistance.](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/nepal-earthquake-kathmandu-welcomes-thanks-india-rescue-operations-says-un-2264854.html)"
1.4.4.4.1.4.2. Con: It has been argued that the rapid help sent from India was a result of [its willingness to gain influence in Nepal over the US](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32492273).
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Nepalese PM Oli came to power on the back of an [anti-India campaign](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-07-15/liquid-nationalism.html) owing to the [2015 blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Nepal_blockade) created by India.

Con: India has helped Nepal by inaugurating two important infrastructure projects [under the 'Nepal-Bharat Development Cooperation' program](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/with-india-funding-nepal-inaugurates-two-crucial-infrastructure-projects-121040600154_1.html).

1.4.4.4.4.2. Con: PM Modi's political party, the BJP, rose to prominence in the 1980's by protesting and [eventually destroying a mosque in Ayodhya](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-hindu-explains-the-babri-masjid-case/article21248813.ece) to replace it by a Hindu temple.
1.4.4.5. Pro: PM Modi's foreign policy has [frayed](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-russia-relation-prime-minister-narendra-modi-vladimir-putin-3051614/) India's relationship with formerly strong ally Russia.
1.4.4.5.1. Con: Russia continues to be India’s [main supplier](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/op-ed/030518/of-us-russia-indias-arms-bazar.html) of major arms [and equipment](https://theprint.in/defence/russia-remains-indias-biggest-defence-supplier-despite-tilt-towards-us/204612/).
1.4.4.5.1.1. Pro: In 2021, Russia was still eager to sell [S400](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/russia-will-start-supplying-s-400-missile-india-q4-interfax-2021-05-20/) missile systems to India and have jointly developed hypersonic missiles with India.
1.4.4.5.1.2. Con: Russia was [India's main supplier until 2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102702/countries-where-russia-is-a-major-arms-supplier/), since then India's preferences have changed.

1.4.4.5.1.2.2. Con: Even if India's preferences have changed, it seems that India is [still buying most of its weapons from Russia](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/fact-india-still-buys-most-its-weapons-russia-181718).

Con: The [Russia-China relationship](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/07/02/future-of-the-india-russia-relationship-post-sochi-summit/) has strengthened in the last couple of years, irrespective of PM Modi's actions, which has led to strengthening Pakistan-Russia relations at the expense of Indian-Russian relations.
1.4.4.5.3.1. Pro: Both China and Russia have been [challenged](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/02/06/it-looks-like-the-u-s-really-does-want-to-isolate-russia-and-china/#4f2633ca1dd7) by the US. While China has been able to sustain its economic competition, Russia's weak economy made it [dependent on China for cooperation](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/07/02/future-of-the-india-russia-relationship-post-sochi-summit/). As a result, relations between Russia and Pakistan have strengthened, due to the strong relationship between Pakistan and China.
1.4.4.5.3.2. Con: [Indian and Russian foreign and defense ministers have been meeting in 2021](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3131683/message-us-and-china-india-and-russia-put-two-and-two-together) to clear up bilateral misunderstandings and send a message of strength to the US and China.

Pro: Russia has chosen to become stronger allies with [Pakistan](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2473361/russiapakistan-strategic-relations-an-emerging-entente-cordiale/), and it even conducted its first ever [military exercise with the Pakistani Army](https://www.army-technology.com/news/russia-pakistan-joint-military-drill/) in 2020.
1.4.4.6. Con: PM Modi has invested [significant effort](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/5-foreign-policy-trends-in-three-years-of-the-modi-government_a_22121586) into building India's engagement with the US, having already paid multiple visits to the US since assuming office.
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: [PM Modi visited the US in September 2021 to meet US President Joe Biden](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modis-visit-critical-to-strengthening-india-us-relationship/articleshow/86414832.cms) and attend the first Squad Summit at the White House.
1.4.4.6.2. Pro: [According to the US State Department](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-india/), the US "supports India’s emergence as a leading global power and vital partner in efforts to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity."
1.4.4.6.3. Con: PM Modi arguably linked India too closely with the presidency of Donald Trump. As such, since he is no longer president, India's foreign policy goals have been diminished.
1.4.4.6.3.1. Con: [The US White House released a statement in 2021](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/24/u-s-india-joint-leaders-statement-a-partnership-for-global-good/) declaring that President Biden had welcomed PM Modi and they were "renewing their close relationship and charting a new course to advance the partnership between the world’s largest democracies."
1.4.4.6.3.2. Pro: Without Trump in office, India is [no longer](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/03/india-vishwaguru-modi-second-wave-soft-power-self-sufficiency/)(India, which has been envisaged since former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration became the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue’s lynchpin and focused other efforts in the Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China, will have to work harder to justify that role.) seen as having as big of a role within the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue as they had before.
1.4.4.6.4. Con: India's engagement with the Trump administration has highly unbalanced and often forced India to make harmful compromises.
1.4.4.6.4.1. Pro: The US [continuously postponed](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/us-postpones-22-dialogue-with-india-due-to-unavoidable-reasons-mea/articleshow/64769208.cms)(India and US ties appeared to have entered a phase of uncertainty on Wednesday following Washington’s decision to postpone 2+2 dialogue scheduled for July 6 after Delhi reportedly refused to toe the Trump administration’s line on cutting down on all oil supplies from the Persian Gulf country.\n\nThis was the second time that USA has postponed the maiden 2+2 dialogue with India first being exit of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State earlier this year and subsequent Senate confirmation of his successor Mike Pompeo.) the 2+2 dialogue with India.
1.4.4.6.4.1.1. Pro: The eventual 2+2 meeting [did not yield important results](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-waiver-us-wants-all-to-import-zero-oil-from-iran/articleshow/65710612.cms)(Even after the maiden 2+2 India-US dialogue, the US remained non-committal on whether or not it would allow India a waiver from sanctions meant to prevent energy imports from Iran. Similarly, it wasn’t clear immediately after the talks if the US would allow India to go ahead with its S-400 anti-aircraft missile defence system from Russia without invoking Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act \(CAATSA\).) in favour of India. The deal that got signed benefits the USA more.
1.4.4.6.4.1.2. Con: The 2+2 dialogue has facilitated greater US-Indian coordination on healthcare, energy and cybersecurity and intelligence sharing, which will [benefit both sides](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/the-third-india-us-22-dialogue-defence-china-and-indo-pacific-security/)(Both sides took much-needed steps to enhance cooperation in the healthcare field by reaffirming their collaboration to develop vaccines, therapeutics, and essential medical equipment, and taking initiatives to set up an International Center of Excellence in Research to deal with infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Both sides also assessed the progress and prospects of energy security, sustainable financing for infrastructure development, cyber security, and counter-terrorism.) greatly.
1.4.4.6.4.2. Pro: India is expected [to fold under US pressure](https://scroll.in/article/815307/how-india-is-auditioning-for-the-role-of-us-sidekick) rather than play as an equal partner with the US in geopolitics.
1.4.4.6.4.3. Con: PM Modi's good relationship with Trump meant that India [avoided significant tariffs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-51638345)("The visit will at least push India down the trade hit list of the Trump administration as negotiations continue for the trade deal," she says.) during Trump's period of increased protectionism.
1.4.4.6.4.3.1. Con: Trump's trade disruption tactics revoked some of the [privileges](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/us-import-tariffs-on-steel-aluminium-india-hits-back-to-suspend-concessions-on-30-products-5219944/) \(aluminium and steel imports\) India previously enjoyed with the US.
1.4.4.6.4.4. Con: Trump produced a [global order](https://thewire.in/world/modi-trump-authoritarianism-biden-harris)(The international community tolerated and debated hypocrisy but it was not one where the US administration itself masterminded the whole scale abandonment of norms, as it has been during Trump’s tenure.) that allowed PM Modi to thrive and increase his power.
1.4.4.6.4.5. Con: In 2019, [India’s trade surplus with the US was small](https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/india-was-not-in-trumps-hit-list-of-countries-over-trade-but-still-had-tariffs-imposed/342007/) compared to China, Japan and Mexico.
1.4.5. Pro: Under PM Modi, India has become an important regional counterweight to a rising China.
1.4.5.1. Con: Modi's government has ceded or lost ground to China.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: With the developments over [Assumption Island in Seychelles](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/india-seychelles-military-base-plan-hits-choppy-waters-180321150926691.html), India has potentially started soft geopolitical competition with China.
1.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: As China has sought to increase their political and military influence over Seychelles, PM Modi has sought to build an [Indian military base](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/why-change-of-guard-in-seychelles-matters-914949.html)(A base in Seychelles will certainly help India to acquire a permanent foothold in the Western Indian Ocean near some of the busiest shipping lanes of the world. Meanwhile, India is building military facilities in neighbouring Mauritius’ Agalega islands and is steadily increasing its naval presence in the Western Indian Ocean.) in Assumption, potentially worsening ties with China.
1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: It is China's aggression that has instigated this conflict. It is, therefore, not the fault of PM Modi.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Modi's government has lost ground to China in its relationship with [Sri Lanka](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/china-muscling-out-india-in-sri-lanka-with-money-power/articleshow/65100502.cms?from=mdr), where China has been financing large-scale infrastructure, thereby increasing their influence.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: The '[Line of Actual Control'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Actual_Control)(The Line of Actual Control \(LAC\) is a notional demarcation line that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory in the Sino-Indian border dispute.The term is said to have been used by Zhou Enlai in a 1959 letter to Jawaharlal Nehru.It subsequently referred to the line formed after the 1962 Sino-Indian War and is part of the Sino-Indian border dispute.) in the [Himalayan region](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484) is still being disputed between India and China.
1.4.5.1.4. Con: In 2021, India redirected 50,000 troops to the Chinese border in what is considered a [historical move](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-shifts-50-000-troops-to-china-border-in-historic-move-11624838652165.html).
1.4.5.1.5. Pro: In 2020, China had [occupied fresh territory in Ladakh](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/how-much-of-indian-land-in-ladakh-is-occupied-by-china-1691859-2020-06-23), but PM Modi hid the occupation by claiming that “the Chinese have not intruded into Indian territory.”
1.4.5.2. Con: The growth of China could be good for India, but opposition to China by PM Modi is preventing cooperation.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: PM Modi [held an informal summit](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/asia/modi-xi-wuhan-meeting-intl/index.html) with Xi Jinping, with the goal of building a cooperative, and not combative, Sino-Indian relationship.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: China and India [set up working groups](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2b73/d99ae97f793debc519f8bb70ebefc0679885.pdf) to resolve border disputes peacefully, but PM Modi has understaffed these groups. \(p.453\)
1.4.5.2.3. Pro: China and India [have naturally complimentary economies](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2b73/d99ae97f793debc519f8bb70ebefc0679885.pdf), and they were hurt by PM Modi's increase in tariffs. \(p. 455\)
1.4.5.2.4. Con: [Chinese President Xi Jinping](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/china-ready-to-strengthen-ties-president-xi-jinping-writes-to-pm-modi-121043001486_1.html) offered his support to PM Modi to fight the pandemic.
1.4.5.3. Pro: India is the only country that has consistently opposed [China's Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative)(The Belt and Road Initiative, known in Chinese and formerly in English as One Belt One Road or OBOR for short, is a global infrastructure development strategy adopted by the Chinese government in 2013 to invest in nearly 70 countries and international organizations.) and actually seemed to have a [strategy of its own](https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2018C07_wgn_Tripathi.pdf). \(p.1\)
1.4.5.4. Pro: On the back of growing Chinese naval activity in the Indian Ocean region, the Modi administration has introduced [Project Mausam](https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/project-mausam-indias-answer-to-chinas-maritime-silk-road/)(The project is considered the Modi government’s most significant foreign policy initiative designed to counter China. It is inspired by India’s historical role as the focal point for trade in the Indian Ocean. In pre-modern times, sailors used seasonal monsoons \(mausam, मौसम means weather or season in many South Asian languages\) to swiftly journey across the Indian Ocean.), to rival the Chinese Maritime Silk Road \(MSR\) initiative.
1.4.6. Con: When President [Trump weighed down on the Iran deal](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/trump-press-allies-to-quit-importing-iranian-oil-by-nov-4.html), India was forced to cut oil supplies from Iran on November 4, 2018. This was caused by PM Modi's close relationship to President Trump.
1.4.6.1. Con: India has continued Iranian oil imports even after the introduction of [US sanctions](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/india-to-continue-iranian-oil-imports-post-us-sanctions/articleshow/66088584.cms).
1.4.6.2. Pro: Given that India can procure oil from Iran [at a significantly cheaper price](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-raise-iran-oil-curbs-with-us/articleshow/64862559.cms), India's national interests will take a [serious toll](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/India-Folds-Under-Pressure-Halts-Iranian-Oil-Imports.html). This will also jeopardize the India-Iran relationship.
1.5. Con: PM Modi has divided India.
1.5.1. Con: The Modi government is promoting the use of [Hindi as a unifying national language.](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hindi-our-national-language-cant-progress-without-it-venkaiah-naidu-1716504)
1.5.1.1. Con: India is a multicultural, diverse nation where the Constitution explicitly states there is no national language and that [22 languages are recognized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution_of_India), therefore imposing a language is one way of imposing culture.
1.5.1.2. Pro: According to [Union Home Minister Amit Shah](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/parallel-development-of-hindi-other-indian-languages-under-new-education-policy-amit-shah/articleshow/78101963.cms?from=mdr), the education policy launched by PM Modi provided for the development of India's linguistic diversity, as a symbol of unity.
1.5.2. Pro: PM Modi has been deliberately stoking racial and religious tensions.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Narendra [Modi's BJP party](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-will-become-hindu-rashtra-by-2024-says-uttar-pradeshs-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-4302275.html) has campaigned on its proposal to turn India into a '[Hindu rashtra](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-will-become-hindu-rashtra-by-2024-says-uttar-pradeshs-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-4302275.html)' by 2024, meaning that the country will no longer tolerate cultural heterogeneity.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: There is a growing divide between Christians and the ruling government, especially as a Hindu Nationalist [was appointed governor](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/letter-catholic-archbishop-incensed-india-bjp-180529105850511.html) of Christian-majority Mizoram.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: A member of the Legislative Assembly \(MLA\) of the BJP [publicly stated](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-will-become-hindu-rashtra-by-2024-says-uttar-pradeshs-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-4302275.html) that the BJP is aiming to turn India into a 'Hindu rashtra' by 2024.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: The words of individual party members should not be interpreted as the official stance of the entire party. The BJP has made no official statement ito signify that a Hindu rashtra is the party's goal.

Pro: It is expected that PM Modi will use the newly built nationalist [Statue of Unity](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-spends-430-million-on-statue-of-unity-in-gujarat-narendra-modi-to-inaugurate-182-metre-high-project-on-31-october-5103031.html) to rouse Hindu nationalist support in the next election.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: Hindus in India are often treated far better than [Muslims](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/features/2018/4/12/anti-muslim-bigotry-has-been-normalised-under-modi) under PM Modi and thus may have an additional incentive to vote for him.
1.5.2.1.3.2. Con: It is unlikely that a single statue could rouse Hindu nationalist support. India has many different sites with [Indo-Islamic architecture](http://ccrtindia.gov.in/indoislamicarchitecture.php).
1.5.2.1.4. Con: If PM Modi's BJP party wins again in 2024, it means that the majority of Indians want to turn India into a 'Hindu rashtra'.
1.5.2.2. Con: Modi's government has not launched any schemes aimed at benefitting people of only one religion.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: The decision related to the [Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/partition-not-religion-should-decide-citizenship-claims/articleshow/64491153.cms) to exclude people based on religion and not on "partition" clearly shows the divisive motive of the government.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: Many policies introduced by the Modi government, like the [Ghar-Wapsi, the beef bans](http://www.firstpost.com/politics/ghar-wapsi-to-beef-ban-how-life-has-changed-since-modi-became-prime-minister-2244780.html), the [campaign against anti-nationalism](https://thediplomat.com/2016/02/modis-new-mantra-if-youre-not-with-me-youre-anti-national/) and the [increased focus on ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’](https://theprint.in/opinion/bharat-mata-ki-jai-not-patriots-indians-now-want-to-be-patriotism-police/172524/) have deliberately divided India through the scheme of ['divide and rule'](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-deliberately-dividing-india-says-bjp-leader-arun-shourie/article8566849.ece).
1.5.2.2.3. Pro: The Ayushman Bharat which offers free medical insurance, Ujjwala Yojana that offers free LPG connections, the Atal Pension scheme, and Har Ghar Jal Scheme for drinking water [benefit all Indians](https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-6-schemes-which-pm-modi-wants-to-reach-all-and-need-for-a-quantum-jump-in-the-run-up-to-2024-4090235.html).
1.5.2.3. Pro: Narendra Modi has been accused of overseeing - and being indifferent to - a [climate of growing intolerance](https://www.aspeniaonline.it/narendra-modis-mixed-records-ambition-and-gambles/) against Muslims.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: PM Modi has yet to show [any remorse](https://www.vox.com/cards/narendra-modi/what-was-the-2002-gujarat-violence-that-has-so-marred-modis-image) for the religious clashes that happened in [Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots)(The 2002 Gujarat riots, also known as the 2002 Gujarat violence and the Gujarat pogrom, was a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat. The burning of a train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims karsevaks returning from Ayodhya, is cited as having instigated the violence. Following the initial riot incidents, there were further outbreaks of violence in Ahmedabad for three months; statewide, there were further outbreaks of violence against the minority Muslim population of Gujarat for the next one year.) under his watch and killed more than 1,000 Muslims.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: Narendra Modi should have taken moral responsibility for the Gujarat massacre and quit public life long ago. [The SIT report](https://scroll.in/article/920939/2002-gujarat-riots-why-the-clean-chit-given-to-narendra-modi-does-not-absolve-him) on the Gujarat riots is marred with controversies and [did not completely exonerate](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/one-tragedy-one-sit-two-differing-reports/story-kvYSVv5EgIiVAIz3JQhZEN.html) Narendra Modi either.
1.5.2.3.1.2. Con: PM Modi did eventually [apologized by stating](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/here-it-comes-an-apology-from-modi-for-gujarat-riots-680400.html): "For that failing of the State government, I offer my unequivocal apology, as the current Chief Minister of the vibrant State of Gujarat."
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: According to [Arundhati Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Roy)(Suzanna Arundhati Roy \(born 24 November 1961\) is an Indian author best known for her novel The God of Small Things \(1997\), which won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997 and became the best-selling book by a non-expatriate Indian author. She is also a political activist involved in human rights and environmental causes.), Indian Muslims are facing a ‘[genocidal climate](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/arundhati-roy-indian-muslims-facing-genocidal-climate-amid-pandemic/)’ under Modi's government.
1.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Right-wing Hindu groups](https://www.dw.com/en/narendra-modis-4-years-in-power-good-or-bad-for-india/a-43974581) which had insignificant influence prior to Modi's elections, have become extremely powerful. As an unfortunate result, forced conversions of Muslims and Christians to Hinduism have been on the rise.
1.5.2.3.2.2. Pro: The BJP initially came to power by creating [hysteria](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/indian-election-narendra-modi-bjp-donald-trump-far-right-a7635086.html) against Muslims for "disrespecting" cows.
1.5.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: Since the [opposition of Muslims](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/india-muslims-marginalized-population-bjp-modi) is what gave the party its base, it is unlikely that PM Modi will ever cease to campaign using Hindu nationalist rhetoric.
1.5.2.3.2.2.2. Con: The BJP also came to power as a result of [its economic, anti-corruption, and nationalist program](https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/lok-sabha-2019/story/bjp-narendra-modi-lok-sabha-elections-1526140-2019-05-16).

Con: [Within days of his re-election](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/southasia/2019/07/08/long-read-muslims-and-an-inclusive-india-under-modi-2-0/), PM Modi "exhorted party members and his fellow parliamentarians to regain the trust of the country’s minorities, including Muslims through '[Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas](https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/after-sabka-saath-sabka-vikas-win-sabka-vishwas-modi-s-message-of-inclusion/story-6i8Lo7ve0ibklPOR7E4jqI.html)' \(collective efforts, inclusive growth, with everyone’s trust\)."
1.5.2.3.4. Con: The fact that an estimated [8% of Muslims voted for the BJP in the 2019 elections](https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/modi-pm-muslims-minority-report-1547770-2019-06-13) \(double the amount of the 2009 Lok Sabha polls\) showed that PM Modi has now more support from the Muslim community.
1.5.2.4. Pro: PM Modi has normalized, motivated and facilitated violence, especially towards specific religious and ethnic groups.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: [Cow vigilantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_vigilante_violence_in_India)(In India, cow vigilante violence is the use of physical force in the name of "cow protection". Since 2014, mob attacks targeting mostly illegal cow smugglers, but in some cases even licensed cow traders, have become prominent. There is a debate on whether there has actually been any change in the number of such incidences, as Government Data points out to reduced communal tensions post 2014.), where people taking the law into their own hands to protect cows, has been on rise and the PM is [hesitant to act](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cow-vigilantes-pm-modi-gujarat-gau-rakshaks-985475-2017-06-29) to reduce it.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Pro: A man was killed for being [suspected](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alwar-lynching-pehlu-khan-killed-by-cow-vigilantes-was-no-cattle-smuggler/story-oHFwJT3e8R8kJn396KEGOO.html) to be a cow smuggler.

Pro: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath [questioned](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-karnataka-cm-is-hindu-let-him-ban-beef-yogi/articleshow/62407920.cms) Karnataka's counterpart Siddaramaiah for not banning beef in his state, which shows the potentially harmful stance that PM Modi's party has taken, as such pointed statements can embolden cow protection gangs to further their violence.
1.5.2.4.1.3. Con: Due to the increase in 'cow vigilantism', Modi's government has adopted stricter laws and punishments for cow slaughter and even for transportation, possession, and/or sale of cattle and/or beef. \([p. 1](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/india0219_appendix_1.pdf)\)
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: There has been a sharp [increase in violence](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/02/25/amnesty-modi_n_6748946.html), especially in the name of [Hindutva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva)(Hindutva \(transl. Hinduness\) is the predominant form of Hindu nationalism in India.), under Narendra Modi's prime ministership.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: T.M. Krishna, regarded as one of the foremost carnatic singers in the country, was attacked online by [right-wing goons](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/tm-krishna-carnatic-music-concert-scrapped-delhi-1388922-2018-11-15) and was forced to call off his concert.
1.5.2.4.2.2. Pro: PM Modi has been silent in response to cases of violence, which has encouraged mobs and lynching.
1.5.2.4.2.2.1. Pro: While PM Modi [tweeted](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/742054515696754690) shunning gun violence in America, he completely ignored the [lynching of Muslims on the rumour of beef eating.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34409354)
1.5.2.4.2.2.2. Pro: The [minorities, dalits, tribals and poor](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-10) have been feeling more insecure than they have ever been before.
1.5.2.4.2.2.3. Con: PM Modi has [appealed for calm](https://time.com/4067568/modi-dadri-lynching-beef-rally-bihar-hindu-muslim/) after some cases of violence.
1.5.2.4.2.2.4. Con: In 2017, PM Modi stated that ["violence in the name of faith won't be accepted.](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/violence-in-name-of-faith-wont-be-accepted-pm-narendra-modi-on-mob-attacks-1737753)"
1.5.2.4.2.3. Pro: There have been multiple cases of violence either inspired or directly caused by Narendra Modi.
1.5.2.4.2.3.1. Pro: Narendra Modi's government has been been [unable and unwilling to rein in vigilantes](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/06/28/rise-in-lynch-mobs-attacks-on-muslims-by-cow-vigilantes-under-m_a_23005424/) that attack Muslims.

Pro: Many top scientists and artists [returned](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/11963542/Top-Indian-artists-and-scientists-return-awards-in-protest-at-alleged-climate-of-intolerance-under-Narendra-Modi.html) national awards in response to the anti-Muslim and anti-minority climate created in India by Modi's government.
1.5.2.4.2.3.1.2. Con: [PM Modi publicly warned cow vigilantes](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/killing-people-in-the-name-of-gau-bhakti-not-acceptable-pm-modi/story-XToseVqb3wNZBJwAeWb0sO.html), and stated that "killing people in the name of gau bhakti \(is\) not acceptable."
1.5.2.4.2.3.2. Pro: In 2002, Modi, then the Chief Minister of Gujarat, instigated one of the worst periods of [mass murder](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/07/narendra-modi-massacre-next-prime-minister-india)(On 27 February that year, a train coach carrying Hindu pilgrims caught fire in Godhra station in Gujarat. Fifty-eight people died. Within hours and without a shred of evidence, Modi declared that the Pakistani secret services had been to blame; he then had the charred bodies paraded in the main city of Ahmedabad; and let his own party support a state-wide strike for three days. What followed was mass bloodshed: 1,000 dead on official estimates, more than 2,000 by independent tallies. The vast majority of those who died were Muslim.) in Indian history.
1.5.2.4.2.3.3. Con: Since becoming PM, Modi has [condemned](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-politics-religion-idUSKBN19K13S)(Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday broke his silence over a wave of attacks on people accused of eating beef or slaughtering cows, saying that killing in the name of an animal sacred to majority Hindus was wrong.) and sought to prevent killings on the basis of religion.
1.5.2.4.2.4. Con: There is an increase in violence because [Hindutva has become synonymous with Indian nationalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0031322X.2020.1759861).
1.5.2.4.2.5. Con: ‘[Hindutva](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0031322X.2020.1759861)(It situates the origins of Hindutva in colonial India where it emerged through sustained interaction with ideologues in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany who, in turn, engaged with Hindutva to further their own ideological developments. Following India’s independence, Hindutva actors played a central role in the violence of nation-building and in creating a majoritarian identity. Yet Hindutva was not truly ‘mainstreamed’ until the election of the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, in 2014.)’ is an ideology that encompasses a wide range of forms: it not only refers to violent and paramilitary fringe groups, but also to organizations that advocate the restoration of Hindu ‘culture’, and mainstream political parties
1.5.2.4.2.6. Pro: The Supreme Court has [reprimanded](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-condemns-mob-lynchings-asks-parliament-to-make-law/story-QqEIgLfpmJZZCjeU4XyTMI.html) the parliament for not taking enough action to curb violence.
1.5.2.4.2.6.1. Pro: The police failed in their response to the [Alwar lynching](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/alwar-lynching-rajasthan-police-admit-delay-in-taking-victim-to-health-centre-5271312/).
1.5.2.4.2.6.2. Con: PM Modi has also been praised by judges of the Supreme Court which has shown that "[the so-called church-state separation is blurry](https://theprint.in/opinion/supreme-court-judges-gushing-over-modi-is-a-problem-for-judiciary-and-democracy/370935/)."
1.5.2.4.3. Pro: According to [human rights group Amnesty International](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/amnesty-modi_n_6748946), India has witnessed an increase in [communal violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_violence)(Communal violence is a form of violence that is perpetrated across ethnic or communal lines, the violent parties feel solidarity for their respective groups, and victims are chosen based upon group membership. The term includes conflicts, riots and other forms of violence between communities of different religious faith or ethnic origins.) under Modi's government.

1.5.2.4.5. Con: Because the Indian constitution guarantees democracy, civil liberties, and secularism, PM Modi hasn't managed to create a [Hindu authoritarian state](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/despite-modi-india-has-not-yet-become-hindu-authoritarian-state#).
1.5.2.5. Con: [PM Modi met with Pope Francis](https://www.dw.com/en/g20-indias-modi-meets-pope-francis-for-first-time/a-59670240) in October 2021, which showed Narendra Modi's support to the Christian community.
1.5.3. Pro: PM Modi has worsened the North-South divide.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Modi's government has also been accused of [diverting funds](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/in-india-north-south-divide-grows-more-dangerous-1842495) from the South to the North.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: [Tamil Nadu gets back 30 rupees for every 100 it sends to New Delhi](https://theprint.in/opinion/for-rich-south-india-the-rest-of-the-country-is-a-tax-burden/52215/), while the northern state of Bihar, by contrast, receives 219 rupees.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: In 2019, Bihar had the [lowest per capita electricity](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/indias-power-consumption-much-below-global-average-bihar-assam-worst-performers/1774263/) consumption and the [per capita income in the state](https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/percapitaincome.htm) was less than half of the country's average. Diverting money from richer states like Tamil Nadu to backward states like Bihar actually helps reduce the North-South divide.
1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: The budget allocation for [North India has increased to Rs 55,820 crore in 2020-21](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/budget-allocation-for-north-india-increased-to-rs-55820-crore/articleshow/80635207.cms?from=mdr).
1.5.3.1.2. Con: PM Modi has not been diverting funds, he's formulated [a new tax-sharing formula](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/southern-states-biggest-losers-in-new-tax-sharing-formula/articleshow/73861255.cms) which changes how the proceeds are allocated.
1.5.3.2. Pro: PM Modi's [new tax plan](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/the-latest-humiliation-by-bjp-of-southern-states-by-mihir-swarup-sharma-1827296) has ensured that the northern Hindi heartland will get a larger share of benefits from federal taxes, further entrenching the North-South divide.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: The population of the South has not grown at the same rate as the North in India. Previously, this [demographic change](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/in-india-north-south-divide-grows-more-dangerous-1842495) was ignored, leading to more attention being spent on the South. PM Modi has simply reversed this.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: [South Indian states are objecting to Finance Comission's mandate](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/YeTLbFIBK7aq5k4SqrnUMP/Why-South-India-states-are-objecting-to-Finance-Commissions.html) because they will get a smaller tax revenue even if they generate most of it.
1.5.3.3. Con: PM Modi has defended himself by stating that it is the Congress Party who "[believes in divide, lie and rule](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/british-had-policy-of-divide-and-rule-congress-party-believes-in-divide-lie-and-rule-pm-modi-955305.html)."
1.5.3.4. Con: Modi's government has strengthened "[grassroots democracy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-government-has-strengthened-grassroots-democracy-in-jammu-and-kashmir-jitendra-singh/articleshow/86326117.cms)" in some problematic northern regions.
1.5.3.5. Con: In 2021, PM Modi and the BJP won [electoral victories](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-first-time-in-20-years-bjp-makes-mark-down-south-101620070210935.html)(The Bharatiya Janata Party has made some significant electoral gains down south, especially in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, where its vote share has increased from previous elections. The party could also get some consolation in Kerala, where its vote-share did not go down much despite the Left Front alliance sweeping the polls.\n\nFor the first time, the BJP, whose strong hold has always been the Hindi heartland, has made a mark in the southern states, where it had failed to expand its base despite several efforts.) in southern regions, indicating that support for them had increased there.
1.5.4. Con: Narendra Modi often mentions the positives of unity and diversity.
1.5.4.1. Con: Much of this rhetoric has been seen as disingenuous and fake.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: PM Modi's rhetoric has sought to [polarize](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/divided-families-and-tense-silences-us-style-polarization-arrives-in-india/2019/05/18/734bfdc6-5bb3-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html) India.

1.5.4.1.1.2. Con: PM Modi has publicly stated that "[diversity is the identity of \[India's\] strong democracy.](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1101302)"
1.5.4.1.2. Con: [PM Modi has been praised for breaking taboos](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/talkingturkey/breaking-taboo-modi-talking-about-sanitary-pads-in-i-day-speech-is-indeed-refreshing/) such as the speech about sanitary pads he gave in I-Day speech.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Especially during COVID-19, PM Modi made many [speeches and addresses](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/unity-is-power-strength-progress-and-empowerment-pm-modi-11603608373700.html)(“Today through our speech, bearing, actions and every moment we have to carry forward the entire spectrum of values that unite us. This is so that sense of ease and belongingness is inculcated in the mind of the citizen living in one part of country for citizen living in other," he added.) emphasizing the importance of unity.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Often, PM Modi uses this rhetoric of unity to lambast opposition forces who he claims are sowing suspicion and division.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: PM Modi has called for unity, by stating that the "[virus doesn’t see religion](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-calls-for-unity-saysvirus-doesn-t-see-religion/story-odKsutBpjYQ6hdv5lVWjMJ.html)."

1.5.5.2. Pro: Narendra Modi maintains an [army of trolls](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-twitter-trolls-free-expression) on Twitter who have routinely issued rape threats, death threats and indulged in communal incitement.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: The [foreign affairs minister](https://twitter.com/sushmaswaraj/status/1010835030896070656?s=12) was attacked on [Twitter in 2018 by trolls](https://scroll.in/article/884226/the-social-media-assault-on-sushma-swaraj-is-not-mere-trolling-it-is-moral-collapse). By following them, the PM Modi has made the actions of such trolls acceptable.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: It has all been part of [PM Modi's Twitter strategy](https://scroll.in/article/925754/this-is-probably-why-narendra-modi-follows-his-supporters-including-trolls-on-twitter): to follow generously because "a follow from the prime minister gives supporters a 'major confidence boost'."
1.5.5.3. Pro: PM Modi has failed to effectively condemn attacks against [women](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-silent-on-atrocities-on-women-such-incidents-didnt-happen-in-3-000-years-rahul-gandhi-1896707) in India, including those in which supporters and members of his party are implicated.

1.5.5.3.1.1.2. Con: PM Modi has sent a [strong message against rape](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-narendra-modi-mann-ki-baat-rape-triple-talaq-5325486/) by stating that: "Those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of 10 years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence."
1.5.5.3.1.2. Pro: PM Modi has pointed out that rape is a [societal problem](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/asia/modi-rape-politicized-india-intl/index.html) that needs to be addressed and society needs to stop victim-blaming women and start questioning the actions of men.

1.5.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: This is a significant change from even the recent past, when punishments for similar crimes were weak or non-existent.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3. Con: The imposition of a death penalty [might not deter rape](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44922084)('Added burden for victims'\n\nThis concern has been voiced by many Indian activists who oppose the death penalty for rape.\n\n"Under-reporting is a problem because the perpetrators are mostly known to the victims and there are all sorts of dynamics at play that cause victims and their guardians to not report the crime," said Dr Anup Surendranath, the executive director of Project 39A, a social justice organisation.).

1.5.5.5.4.2.2.

1.5.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Narendra Modi has never used unparliamentary or abusive language against his political opponents, inside or outside the parliament, [unlike other politicians](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-bjp-language-parliament).
1.5.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Rahul Gandhi has been described as "[the most acceptable leader](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rahul-gandhi-most-acceptable-leader-high-time-he-comes-back-as-congress-chief-ajay-maken/articleshow/74545626.cms?from=mdr)(New Delhi: Amid uncertainties over the leadership issue, senior Congress leader and former Union minister Ajay Maken has said it is high time Rahul Gandhi comes back as party president as he is the most acceptable leader.)" by senior Congress leader and former Union minister Ajay Maken.

1.5.6.1.4.1. Con: The notion of '[There Is No Alternative](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/who-says-there-is-no-alternative-to-bjp-and-modi)' \(TINA\) to Prime Minister Narendra Modi is "not just vastly exaggerated or overrated but it is also flawed" because there is always a possibility of an alternative emerging.
1.5.6.1.4.2. Pro: It has been claimed that reinforcing the idea that there was no alternative to Narendra Modi, [was part of BJP’s campaign strategy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-narendra-modi-election-campaign-bjp-nota-there-is-no-alternative-rahul-gandhi-5691217/).

1.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: The BJP [lost](http://www.sify.com/news/5-state-polls-bjp-lost-over-70-constituencies-where-pm-modi-campaigned-news-analysis-smslhuhghiiba.html) in the 2018 5-states assembly elections and lost over 70% constituencies where PM Modi campaigned.

1.5.6.2.2.1. Con: The survey methodology has not been detailed in the article and given that only [31% of the voting population](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/bjps-31-percent-vote-share-heres-who-didnt-vote-for-narendra-modi-1531813.html) voted for PM Modi in the 2014 elections, it's seems highly unlikely that there was such a huge percentage change in his support.
1.5.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: A sample size of 800,000 cannot represent a population of 1.3 billion. Such surveys are better not taken at face value.
1.5.6.2.2.1.2. Con: PM Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, received 37.36% of the vote in the [2019 Indian general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election), which is the highest vote share by a political party since the [1989 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Indian_general_election)
1.5.6.2.2.2. Pro: [In the Indian 2019 elections](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48347081), PM Modi exceeded exit poll predictions and won a larger share of the vote than in the 2014 elections.
1.5.6.2.3. Pro: There have been many protests against PM Modi's rule. This is a sign of passionate disapproval of his government.
1.5.6.2.3.1. Pro: A huge protest [march](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46396118)(Tens of thousands of Indian farmers have marched to the parliament in the capital, Delhi, to highlight the deepening agrarian crisis.\n\nThey arrived on Thursday from across the country and held a rally demanding better crop prices, drought relief and loan waivers.\n\nIndian agriculture has been blighted by a depleting water table and declining productivity for decades.\n\nThis is the fourth such farmers' protest in the past year.\n\nFarmers make up important voting bloc in the country and, analysts say, given the scale of the protests, their discontentment could hurt the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party \(BJP\) in next year's general election.) by Indian farmers claimed a lack of attention by PM Modi on the agrarian crisis.
1.5.6.2.3.2. Pro: When PM Modi [visited the southern city of Chennai](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/in-india-north-south-divide-grows-more-dangerous-1842495) in 2018, he was welcomed by half of the city waving black flags at his motorcade, as well as banners that read "Go Back, Modi."
1.5.6.2.3.3. Con: Protests in a democracy are normal because "[protesting is as important as voting.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/08/28/protesting-is-as-important-as-voting/)"
1.5.6.2.3.4. Con: Former PM [Manmohan Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manmohan_Singh) also [faced several protests](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/when-a-pm-stepped-in-to-get-jnu-protesters-off-the-hook/story-Mhkck8HiadbuZwQSGk9qUN.html) against him and his party.
1.5.6.2.4. Con: [Studies have shown](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2057891120907699) that the BJP has "not only managed to retain its support base which it built in 2014, but also expanded it both geographically and socially."
1.5.6.3. Con: In a [first-past-the-post electoral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting)(In a first-past-the-post electoral system \(FPTP\), voters cast their vote for a candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins \(even if the top candidate gets less than 50%, which can happen when there are more than two popular candidates\). FPTP is a plurality voting method, and is primarily used in systems that use single-member electoral divisions.), winning the most parliamentary constituencies or a vote in parliament does not indicate approval of the majority.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: PM Modi won the [2019 Indian election](https://theconversation.com/india-election-how-narendra-modi-won-with-an-even-bigger-majority-117476) with an even bigger majority.
1.5.6.3.2. Pro: The BJP received [31% of the votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_Indian_general_election,_2014) in the 2014 elections. While this was enough to form a majority government, they did not receive the support of the majority of the voting public, and definitely not of the majority of Indians.
1.5.6.3.2.1. Pro: The BJP's [31% vote share](https://m.timesofindia.com/news/BJPs-31-lowest-vote-share-of-any-party-to-win-majority/amp_articleshow/35315930.cms#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) in 2014 is the lowest of any party to ever win a parliamentary majority.
1.5.6.3.2.2. Con: Even if PM Modi has not been the preferred Prime Minister of the majority of people, [a polling](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-ahead-with-48-votes-in-online-poll-i-pac-survey/articleshow/65662729.cms) in 2018 showed that he was still the most popular potential leader of India.
1.5.6.4. Con: The fact that Indians support him does not mean that PM Modi has been good for the country as a whole.
1.5.6.4.1. Pro: People might support PM Modi because he has been good for them personally rather than the country as a whole.
1.5.6.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.3.1.
1.5.6.4.1.2. Con: In a democracy, people are expected to vote for those who are more [aligned with their interests](https://carnegieendowment.org/2015/06/23/understanding-indian-voter-pub-60416). Therefore, all politicians can be said to only win because they benefit individual voters.
1.5.6.4.2. Pro: PM Modi has used [fake news](https://theprint.in/opinion/why-modi-government-gets-away-with-lies/422211/)(But the lies are so obvious, you wonder why anyone would lie so obviously. Surely, when someone is caught lying they can’t be considered credible anymore?\n\nWhat’s happening here is the plain assertion of power. Our politics has become a contest of who gets to lie and get away with it and who will have to go on a back-foot when their lies are caught.) and lies to build some of his support.
1.5.6.4.2.1. Pro: Many newspapers in India are highly politicized. Some, such as [The Pioneer](http://hillpost.in/2013/08/top-7-newspapers-known-to-favor-specific-political-parties-in-india/94800/), are openly pro-BJP.
1.5.6.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.5.6.4.2.3. Con: Programs, like the '[Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation' \(SVEEP\)](https://eci.gov.in/voter/voter-education/)(VEEP’s primary goal is to build a truly participative democracy in India by encouraging all eligible citizens to vote and make an informed decision during the elections. The programme is based on multiple general as well as targeted interventions which are designed according to the socio-economic, cultural and demographic profile of the state as well as the history of electoral participation in previous rounds of elections and learning thereof.) specifically aimed at increasing voter education, have made it harder for politicians to lie to voters.
1.5.6.4.3. Con: Since India is a democracy, [the will of the people](https://eu.milforddailynews.com/story/opinion/columns/2020/11/07/opiniondeeley-in-democracy-will-of-people-must-be-sacrosanct/114729088/) is the only legitimate indicator of what's good for the country.
1.5.6.4.3.1. Pro: The Indian Constitution is the 'the mother of all Laws' in India, and it is [based on the collective will of the people](https://indiacsr.in/constitution-is-based-on-collective-will-of-the-people/).
1.5.6.4.3.2. Con: There is no objective way to capture the will of [1.3 billion people](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/india-must-make-the-most-of-its-demographic-dividend-11619108083657.html). Therefore, it is untrue to say that PM Modi represents the 'will of the people'.
1.5.6.4.4. Con: [According to a 2019 poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/03/25/a-sampling-of-public-opinion-in-india/), most Indians are satisfied with the way things are going in the country under PM Modi's governance.

1.5.6.6.1. Con: The fact that the BJP government has a majority in the House and has won a confidence motion doesn't necessarily mean that people still like or support PM Modi as much they used to.
1.5.6.6.2. Pro: The no-confidence motion against PM Modi's government was defeated by [325-126 votes](https://theprint.in/politics/live-narendra-modi-govt-faces-its-first-no-confidence-motion/85363/).

1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: While funding for healthcare appears to have risen on paper, actual allocations [are less than they were in 2017-18.](https://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2018-health-education-sanitation-allocation-appears-to-be-most-in-3-years-but-it-isnt-4332137.html)
1.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: The National Nutrition Mission sought to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia and low birth weight of babies, which is a particularly important policy as India had the [largest number of stunted children](https://www.indiaspend.com/india-has-worlds-highest-number-of-stunted-children-child-workers-18579) \([48.2 million](http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/budget-2018-indias-healthcare-crisis-is-holding-back-national-potential-29517)\) in 2017.

About Rs 5,500-6,000 crore have been saved from the price capping of stents.

1.6.1.2.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Some drugs were considered as '[rational](https://theprint.in/health/3-banned-drug-cocktails-get-all-clear-from-modi-govt-but-could-have-few-takers-in-pharma-sector/499268/)(A drug is categorised as “rational” when a combination drug is established to have a proven advantage over a single-compound drug.)' by Modi's government, following the DTAB \(Drugs Technical Advisory Board, a high-level government panel\).

1.6.1.2.3.2.4. Con: Modi's government has pushed for generic or unbranded medicines through Jan Aushadhi stores across the country which could [hurt the branded drugs market](https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-2020-jan-aushadhi-growth-could-hurt-branded-pharma-market-120020200925_1.html).

1.6.1.2.4. Con: In 2017, Modi's government used loopholes to avoid reporting cases of the [Zika virus to the WHO or to the public](https://thewire.in/health/india-healthcare-narendra-modi).

1.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: China is ranked 86th and they have one of the best education systems as suggested by [PISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment) scores \(ranked 6th in maths and 10th in science\).
1.6.1.3.2.

1.6.1.6.6. Pro: Modi's government was not able to prevent [the deadly second wave of COVID-19](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56771766).
1.6.1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.6.1.6.1.2.
1.6.2. Con: Modi's government has harmed the Indian education system.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Education has been starved of funding under Modi's government.

Con: Modi's government greatly [contributed to education](https://scroll.in/article/985125/explainer-why-budget-2021-is-crucial-for-public-school-education-in-india) through centrally sponsored schemes such as the [Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan](https://vikaspedia.in/education/policies-and-schemes/samagra-shiksha)(Samagra Shiksha is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class 12.

1.6.2.2.1. Con: PM Modi increased the reservation quota from 50% to 60%. The move clearly puts social status above competence, which is bad for a developing country.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: In July 2021, Modi's government announced a [27% quota for OBCs and 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section \(EWS\)](https://theprint.in/india/modi-govt-announces-27-reservation-for-obcs-10-quota-for-ews-in-medical-dental-courses/705935/)(Other Backward Class \(OBC\) is a collective term used by the Government of India to classify castes which are educationally or socially disadvantaged.) category in the All-India Quota \(AIQ\) scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses.

1.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: The NEP aims at making education [more accessible and affordable](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/new-education-policy-to-focus-on-teaching-girls-better-schools/articleshow/63091458.cms) by pushing against its commercialization, for example, by enforcing [regulations on private coaching.](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/how-will-nep-2020-affect-the-coaching-industry-in-india-1790173-2021-04-12)
1.6.2.3.1.2. Con: The National Girl Child Day programmes - Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana - launched by Modi's government in 2015 were just [rebrandings of several schemes](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bjp-has-merely-renamed-19-out-of-23-congress-schemes-report) launched and operational since 2007 by UPA-I.

1.6.2.3.1.3.3. Pro: The NEP is likely suffering from corruption due to [the transfer of power to individuals and local authorities.](https://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/new-education-policy-the-good-bad-ugly-from-lens-of-educationist)
1.6.2.3.1.4. Pro: The National Education Policy [emphasizes girls’ education](https://www.devex.com/news/examining-india-s-new-education-policy-through-a-gender-lens-98007), [strengthens public institutions,](https://www.highereducationdigest.com/new-education-policy-a-few-important-things-that-you-need-to-know-from-the-leaders-in-education/) and addresses regional inequality.
1.6.2.3.1.5. Pro: Modi's government's approach to training and educating the population is new and different from the [old approach of rote learning](https://medium.com/the-%C3%B3pinion/end-of-rote-learning-regime-in-india-with-the-national-education-policy-2020-f9aac0addb50).

1.6.2.3.1.5.2. Pro: Modi's government approved the creation of the [first national sports university](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/india-s-first-national-sports-university-to-be-set-up-in-manipur/story-dSEKwFEs2sjGfAIJoGbBnO.html). This specialised university trains students in sports sciences, sports technology, sports management and sports coaching.
1.6.2.3.1.5.3. Pro: Modi's government has set up a [student police cadet program](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/union-minister-to-launch-national-student-police-cadet-programme/article24466106.ece) to give young people real-world training that leads to respect for the law and a greater sense of social responsibility.
1.6.2.3.1.5.4. Con: Even if NEP's approach to learning is different to the old rote learning approach, it does not address the need for systemic change when it comes to “[gender sensitivity](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2020/10/02/indias-national-education-policy-2020-a-reformist-step-forward/)”.
1.6.2.3.1.5.5. Con: [PM Modi hasn't prioritised education](https://scroll.in/article/1001840/by-failing-to-prioritise-education-modi-government-and-the-states-are-harming-indias-future) during the pandemic, therefore the NEP approach hasn't been properly implemented yet.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: The number of students enrolled in undergraduate, postgraduate and research level studies in India [remains low](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/indias-gross-enrolment-ratio-in-higher-education-up-by-0-7-5012579/) compared to many other countries.

1.6.2.3.4.2. Pro: In 2019, [1 in 6 elementary school teachers](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/1-in-6-elementary-school-teachers-not-professionally-trained-in-india-119013100138_1.html) were not professionally trained in India.

1.6.2.3.6.2.1. Con: The article linked above clearly concedes that Exam Warriors "isn’t about gaining knowledge – it’s about cracking exams". Therefore, it is likely that this book will not help students actually gain knowledge.
1.6.2.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: Exams are precisely the problem with India's education system. Rather than improving the assessment system in education, PM Modi has focused on summative end term exams.
1.6.2.3.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Modi's government has withdrawn the [CCE evaluation system](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Class-X-compulsory-board-exam-will-eliminate-CCE-system-in-CBSE-schools/articleshow/56161463.cms) and the [no detention policy](https://www.firstpost.com/india/no-detention-policy-scrapped-experts-criticise-move-say-govt-is-passing-its-responsibility-to-kids-3891899.html). Both of these were aimed at reducing the stress for students of end term exams.
1.6.2.3.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Rote-learning is the main problem with India's education system because it [restricts children's creativity](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/how-rote-learning-restricts-a-child-s-creativity-1739093-2020-11-08).
1.6.2.3.6.2.1.2. Con: The book has successfully helped reduce [exam pressure.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/punjab-student-writes-to-pm-on-how-exam-warriors-helped-reduce-stress-101612499534399.html)
1.6.2.3.6.2.2. Pro: A new [updated version of the book was released in 2021](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/prime-minister-narendra-modis-updated-exam-warriors-to-hit-stands-soon/articleshow/81345812.cms?from=mdr), with "mantras for parents, awareness on crucial topics like mental health, role of technology and time management."
1.6.2.3.6.3. Pro: [Ancient Indian knowledge](https://postcard.news/finally-ncert-books-undergo-revision-ancient-indian-knowledge-and-traditions-given-prominence-over-colonial-history/) and traditions are being given prominence over colonial history.
1.6.2.3.6.3.1. Con: By [diverting focus](https://www.firstpost.com/india/mughals-disappearing-from-textbooks-across-the-country-as-history-seems-subject-to-change-3903053.html) away from more recent historical periods like the [Mughal Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire)(The Mughal, Mogul or Moghul Empire was an early modern empire in South Asia.), history classes become less relevant to the lives of students.
1.6.2.3.6.3.2. Pro: PM Modi has stated that [Sanskrit helps nurture knowledge and strengthens national unity](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/sanskrit-helps-nurture-knowledge-strengthens-national-unity-says-pm-modi/articleshow/85733837.cms).
1.6.2.3.6.4. Con: Religious content has been included in science, history, environment, and mathematics books written by [Hindu nationalist ideologues](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2014/11/4/hindu-right-rewriting-indian-textbooks).
1.6.2.4. Pro: Under the pretext of giving them more autonomy, the government is pushing universities towards [privatisation](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/autonomy-universities-governments-move-privatise-exclusionary). This will increase the cost of higher education and make it inaccessible to poorer sections of the population.
1.6.2.5. Con: The Indian education system PM Modi [inherited](http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-sorry-state-of-education-in-india/) was already in a bad shape. Modi's government has done fine given what it inherited.
1.6.2.5.1. Con: Despite the [problems and issues in school education](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/amp/society-news-99-and-above-is-our-education-system-lost-besides-being-broken/329921), no action plan has been framed by educational boards like CBSE to suggest a more inclusive and [student-teacher friendly curriculum](https://feminisminindia.com/2021/05/17/education-india-modi-government/).
1.6.2.5.2. Pro: Prior to PM Modi taking power, [literacy rates in India](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/nsso-data-reveal-literacy-rate-up-from-64-5-to-69-1-115070100016_1.html)(The literacy rate improved in both rural and urban areas , from 60 per cent to 64.7 per cent in the former and 77.1 per cent to 79.5 per cent in the latter between 2007 and 2008 and in the first six months of 2014.) were lower than those in other countries.
1.6.2.5.3. Pro: Drop out rates under the UPA government [rose from 2008 to 2011, from 5.75% to 6.17%](http://niti.gov.in/content/dropout-rate-primary-level). The dropout rate under the Modi government [has fallen from 2014-15 to 4.13%](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/primary-level-dropout-rate-in-india-was-4-13-in-2014-15-prakash-javadekar-118010400732_1.html).
1.6.2.6. Pro: The government's move to classify a non-existent institute, Jio University, [as an institute of eminence](https://www.thehindu.com/education/six-universities-including-jio-institute-to-be-institutions-of-eminence/article24371429.ece) has come under heavy [criticism](https://thewire.in/education/how-jio-university-got-the-governments-tag-of-eminence-even-before-existing).
1.6.2.6.1. Con: Jio institute has been selected as institution of eminence in [the greenfield category](https://www.news18.com/news/india/jio-institute-picked-as-an-institute-of-eminence-selection-panel-head-explains-why-1806457.html), which is meant to apply to proposed developments and not to existing institutes.
1.6.2.6.1.1. Con: Having a [greenfield category](https://www.gktoday.in/topic/institutions-of-eminence/)(Greenfield institutions are once which are yet to be established and which are sponsored by organisations with a net worth of Rs 5,000 crores collectively.) in the first place to measure academic quality is akin to putting the cart before the wheel because education is about outcomes \(e.g. research papers, placements etc\).
1.6.2.6.1.2. Pro: [The selection panel head explained](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/expert-panel-recommends-12-institutions-for-eminence-status/story-vfO5TfTNmCg3ckdLuW0mRO.html) quality factors such as education and experience of the core team, milestones and action plans had been used for the selection.
1.6.2.6.1.3. Pro: This selection process was conducted by [experts](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/expert-panel-recommends-12-institutions-for-eminence-status/story-vfO5TfTNmCg3ckdLuW0mRO.html) from the Human Resource Development Ministry. This supports the credibility of the decision.
1.6.2.6.1.4. Con: It is irresponsible of the government to have included a greenfield category [based on funding](https://www.uniconexed.org/wp-content/uploads/Greenfield_Era_in_Education_ENG-Denis-Konanchuk-co-author-Sept-2014.pdf). \(p.2\)
1.6.2.6.2. Pro: It has been argued that the Jio University got the Government's [tag of 'Eminence' even before existing](https://thewire.in/education/how-jio-university-got-the-governments-tag-of-eminence-even-before-existing).
1.6.3. Pro: PM Modi has been trying to meet Indians' aspirations with [his policy programmes](https://www.firstpost.com/india/four-years-of-narendra-modi-govt-a-pithy-and-cool-micro-site-tells-and-sells-48-month-success-story-4488435.html).
1.6.3.1. Con: Modi's government has allocated insufficient funds to and thus weakened important programs such as the [National Health Mission](https://thewire.in/government/modi-government-lowers-planned-funding-national-health-mission-almost-20) and [MNREGA](https://www.dailyo.in/business/mgnrega-union-budget-2017-arun-jaitley-narendra-modi-bjp-congress-monumental-failure-allocation/story/1/15437.html) \(National Rural Employment Guarantee Act\).
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Under the Modi government, [spending on the health ministry](https://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2018-health-education-sanitation-allocation-appears-to-be-most-in-3-years-but-it-isnt-4332137.html) had declined to 2.1% of the total Union Budget from the previous 2.4%, in 2017-18.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: PM Modi's 2021 budgets will [allocate more funds to health](https://www.businesstoday.in/news/story/budget-2021-5-areas-modi-govt-may-focus-on-this-budget-286059-2021-01-31), including big incentives and investments in healthcare infrastructure, boosts to technology, research, development and digital health.
1.6.3.2. Con: Most of these are [renamed](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bjp-has-merely-renamed-19-out-of-23-congress-schemes-report) government programmes of the previous government, simply being sold as PM Modi's new programmes to rejuvenate India.
1.6.3.3. Pro: PM Modi launched [India's Aspirational Districts Programm \(ADP\)](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/aspirational-districts-programme-aims-to-ensure-all-round-development-modi-121061200201_1.html)(India's Aspirational Districts Programm \(ADP\) aims to ensure inclusive and all-round development in areas across our nation.) with the objective of ensuring inclusive and all-round development in areas across India.
1.6.3.4. Pro: Many more Indians have a gas stove through the [Ujjwala Yojana](https://m.businesstoday.in/story/connecting-the-dots/1/269206.html)(The effort by the government is part of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana under which five crore LPG connections will be provided to below poverty line, or BPL, families with a support of `1,600 per connection. Issuing connections, however, is only half the recipe for ensuring 100 per cent LPG use. Supply will also have to be sustained over time.), a house through the PM [Awas Yojana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhan_Mantri_Awas_Yojana)(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \(PMAY\) is an initiative by the Government of India in which affordable housing will be provided to the urban poor with a target of building 2 crore \(20 million\) affordable houses by 31 March 2022.), a bank account through [Jandhan Yojana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhan_Mantri_Jan_Dhan_Yojana)(Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana \(PMJDY, transl.

1.6.3.5. Pro: Under PM Modi, most [Indians have a bank account](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57437944) now.
1.6.4. Con: The lives of Indians in poverty have not improved under Modi's government, and many are suffering.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Various [communities](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/maratha-reservation-stir-protests-turn-violent-in-pune/videoshow/65203862.cms) have expressed their anger at the government for failing to improve their economic and social conditions. This has led to large-scale demonstrations.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: [The Patidar reservation agitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patidar_reservation_agitation)(Starting in July 2015, the people of India's Patidar community, seeking Other Backward Class \(OBC\) status, held public demonstrations across the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nThe largest demonstration was held in Ahmedabad on 25 August 2015, and was attended by thousands. Later, there were incidents of violence and arson across the state, resulting in a curfew in several cities and towns.) started in July 2015 when the people of India's [Patidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patidar)(Patidar is an Indian landlord and agrarian caste found mostly in Gujarat but also in at least 22 other states of India.

1.6.4.1.2. Pro: [India has been experiencing the largest protests in decades](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far) because of PM Modi's economic and agricultural policies.
1.6.4.1.3. Con: These protests have not translated into [stronger opposition parties](https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/govt-not-taking-farmers-seriously-as-opposition-parties-are-weak-shiv-sena-120122700025_1.html), indicating that those protesting do not fully oppose PM Modi.
1.6.4.1.3.1. Con: It is more likely the case that opposition parties have [not unified](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-leaders-call-for-unity-to-take-on-bjp/article36019912.ece)(The leaders of 19 parties, who participated in the virtual meet, issued a joint statement that called upon “the people of India to rise to the occasion to defend our secular, democratic Republican order” and announced joint protest action between September 20 and 30.) against the BJP, therefore leaving those protests scattered across different groups. This is not an indication of PM Modi's popularity.
1.6.4.1.3.2. Pro: Until the [Indian National Congress \(INC\) gets involved in discussions with opposition parties](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/india-s-opposition-can-t-beat-modi-without-the-grand-old-party-1.1246892), any effort to build a coalition against the BJP in 2024 could be in vain.
1.6.4.2. Pro: India ranked [55th](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/global-hunger-index-report-2014-released-india-ranked-at-55th-position-1413285606-1) on the Global Hunger Index in 2014 and in 2017, its rank fell to [100th](https://cdn.relaymedia.com/amp/www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/india-is-hungrier-than-north-korea).
1.6.4.2.1. Con: India's rank is only seeming to slip because the Global Hunger Index is adding countries to its report.
1.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: In 2014, India was [ranked 55th](http://www.ifpri.org/previous-global-hunger-index-ghi-reports) out of 74 countries. In 2015, India was 80th position in a list of 104 countries. In 2018, there were 129 countries in the survey, with 25 new countries having been added. India ranked [103rd](https://www.globalhungerindex.org/results/) in the 2018 report.
1.6.4.2.1.2. Con: Regardless of the number of countries, the Global Hunger Index still takes into account the [4 same indicators in which India is still failing](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/food/global-hunger-index-why-is-india-trailing--73920)(GHI is based on four indicators:\n\n The proportion of undernourished in a population\n The proportion of children under the age of five suffering from wasting \(less weight in proportion to their height\)\n The proportion of children under five suffering from stunting \(low height in proportion to their age\)\n The mortality rate of children under five).
1.6.4.2.2. Pro: Such a drastic decrease in its rank showed that the conditions and lifestyles of Indians have not significantly improved as many Indian people still struggle to attain necessities as basic as food.
1.6.4.3. Con: Impoverished Indians have been suffering for generations. The Modi government has not increased their suffering.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: PM Modi has actually been [outspoken in his condemnation](https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/09/02/indias-prime-minister-vows-to-upend-centuries-old-poisonous-caste-system) of the caste system and has expressed a desire to purge India of its influence. Such a move would greatly relieve the suffering of the impoverished by improving social equality.
1.6.4.3.2.1. Con: Despite this rhetoric, PM Modi has done little to dismantle the caste system.
1.6.4.3.2.1.1. Con: The Indian caste system is an incredibly [old and entrenched](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-35650616)(The system which divides Hindus into rigid hierarchical groups based on their karma \(work\) and dharma \(the Hindi word for religion, but here it means duty\) is generally accepted to be more than 3,000 years old.) system of social power. It would be unreasonable to expect one Prime Minister to abolish it.
1.6.4.3.2.1.2. Con: Some of PM Modi's policies have helped [uplift](https://www.ft.com/content/be85580f-d399-449f-87f4-58e55b3057c7)(For the first time in postcolonial Indian history, the two highest constitutional posts are held by low-caste Hindus, both of whom are members of the BJP and its volunteer force, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Modi is an OBC and India’s president Ram Nath Kovind is a Dalit.\n\nThe BJP and RSS even offer financial incentives to encourage inter-caste marriages. Just last month, Modi’s party passed a constitutional amendment, which was demanded by lower-caste communities, to allow Indian states more freedom to designate which groups are socially and economically disadvantaged.\n\nLower castes perceive political Hinduism as a source of social mobility and dignity, and they are voting accordingly. In the 2019 federal elections, the BJP won nearly 60 per cent of parliamentary seats reserved for lower castes and tribals.) lower castes.
1.6.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: PM Modi has purposefully made it [harder](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/narendra-modi-two-caste-society-casteist-bjp)(e also alluded to the fact that political leaders—especially the ones who hail from marginalised communities and fight elections on the plank of social justice—would no longer be able to raise caste-centric issues, such as reservation, during campaigns. He went on to attack opposition leaders and parties for “doing caste-based politics,” and called his victory a validation of his welfare programmes which did not use caste as a determinant.) for activists to fight against the caste system.
1.6.4.3.2.1.4. Pro: The BJP [electoral strategy](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/lok-sabha-elections-uttar-pradesh-bjp-modi-amit-shah-yogi-5751375/)(Data from Uttar Pradesh suggest the BJP pursued in 2019 the same strategy that helped it sweep the state in 2017: cater to all the groups that are not affiliated traditionally with either the SP or the BSP.) has sought to cater to the traditional BJP voter base, which represents upper caste voters.
1.6.4.3.2.2. Pro: A caste-less society has been one of the most important points in PM Modi's '[New India](https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/pm-modi-calls-for-new-india-free-of-caste-corruption-top-10-developments-118022600221_1.html)' vision.
1.6.4.4. Con: Instead of making people rely on the government, PM Modi has encouraged young or poorer entrepeneurs through projects such as the [Mudra loan](https://www.mudra.org.in/AboutUs/Genesis)(Micro Finance is an economic development tool whose objective is to provide income generating opportunities to the people at the bottom of the pyramid. It covers a range of services which include, in addition to the provision of credit, many other credit plus services , financial literacy and other social support services.).
1.6.4.4.1. Pro: PM Modi's [Mudra Loan](http://www.employmentnews.gov.in/VOL.%205%20MUDRA%20BANK%20%20TO%20\(FUND%20THE%20REFUND\).pdf) has [enabled individuals](https://abhijeetgautam.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/mudra-bank/) without any discrimination of caste and creed to start up their own business of choice and support their family.
1.6.4.4.2. Pro: Rather than continuing past failed poverty eradication policies, PM Modi's Mudra Loan gives people seed money for their own business and self esteem.
1.6.4.4.3. Con: Many small business entrepreneurs have faced problems obtaining credit under the [PM Mudra Yojana or Mudra scheme from commercial banks](https://1library.net/document/4yrn49vz-problems-business-entrepreneurs-obtaining-facilities-commercial-specific-reference.html) \(p.1\).
1.7. Con: PM Modi's government has harmed the environment.
1.7.1. Con: It was under the leadership of PM Modi that India formally joined the [Paris Agreement](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/India-joins-Paris-Climate-Change-Agreement-submits-instrument-of-ratification-at-UN-headquarters/articleshow/54643135.cms), which signified the country's dedication to preventing climate change and reducing its carbon footprint.
1.7.1.1. Con: It is widely agreed that the Paris Agreement [will fail to meaningfully halt climate change](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/paris-global-climate-change-agreements) particularly as there is no means of enforcing that countries pursue the recommended policies. As such, joining it carries few costs.
1.7.1.2. Pro: According to PM Modi, India might be able to [meet its Paris agreement commitments ahead of 2030](https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-to-meet-its-paris-agreement-commitments-ahead-of-2030-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/81351882.cms).
1.7.2. Pro: India remains one of the most polluted places in the world.
1.7.2.1. Pro: In 2018, India was 177 out of 180 countries on the [Environmental Performance Index](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/forests/is-pm-modi-really-a-champion-of-the-earth--61739). In 2016, India was ranked 141 on the same index.
1.7.2.2. Pro: 14 of the world's most polluted 15 cities in 2018 [were in India](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/14-worlds-most-polluted-15-cities-india-kanpur-tops-who-list-1224730-2018-05-02).
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: The Supreme Court [harshly questioned](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/people-not-industries-are-more-important-sc-on-pollution-by-pet-coke-2719921.html) the Centre \(NDA\) on failing to take steps to prevent pollution. They stated that "people are more important than industries."
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: Failing to prevent pollution does not mean that the Center's policies are harmful to the environment.
1.7.2.2.1.2. Pro: Negligence or inaction in the face of environmental damage and pollution by a government is as great a harm as active acts of pollution, given [India's fragile natural environment.](http://www.bsienvis.nic.in/Database/FragileEcosystems_23603.aspx)
1.7.2.2.2. Con: PM Modi has opened two expressways around [Delhi](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-road-modi/indias-modi-opens-two-expressways-around-delhi-to-reduce-pollution-idUSKCN1IS0F3) to reduce the number of cars and the amount air pollution in the city.
1.7.2.3. Con: Much of this pollution was caused by decisions made by PM Modi's predecessors.
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: The UPA also promised [a cleaner 'Ganga](https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/a-cleaner-ganga-nda-s-unfulfilled-promise-1556462580465.html)' but failed to deliver it.
1.7.2.3.2. Con: It has been claimed that the environment problem is one of "[the most under-reported disaster of Narendra Modi's government](https://theprint.in/opinion/environment-is-the-most-under-reported-failure-of-narendra-modi-government/223670/)."
1.7.2.4. Con: Air quality in India has been improving during the COVID-19 lockdown.
1.7.2.4.1. Con: Schools and colleges still had to be [shut down](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-59258910)(A toxic haze has smothered Delhi since the festival of Diwali.\n\nThe levels of PM2.5 - tiny particles that can clog people's lungs - in Delhi are far higher than the World Health Organization's \(WHO\) safety guidelines.

1.7.2.4.2. Pro: Studies indicate these changes were actually [not fully reducible](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/india-air-quality-has-been-improving-despite-covid-19-lockdown)(Our assessment of India’s air quality trends has found another underlying and positive trend: air quality has been improving across the country since 2018, and this has nothing to do with the COVID-19 lockdown.) to the reduction in activity due to COVID-19. That means that it was PM Modi's environmental reforms that led to this benefit.
1.7.3. Con: PM Modi's government has made policy changes to address climate change.
1.7.3.1. Pro: The Modi government has launched [Namami Gange](http://nmcg.nic.in/NamamiGanga.aspx) - a multi-million dollar national program to help clean the river Ganga.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Most of the [projects sanctioned thus far](http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/jaitley-said-47-projects-are-done-under-namami-gange-but-not-even-half-are-completed-59618) have been sewerage treatment plants. However, Namami Gange intended to do other tasks like river surface cleaning, afforestation, industrial effluent monitoring and riverfront development.
1.7.3.1.2. Con: Data suggests that out of a total of [157 projects related to Namami Gange, only 76 had been completed](http://nmcgpms.nic.in/Admin.aspx) by December 2020.
1.7.3.1.3. Pro: The Namami Gange project is intended to [reduce pollution and rejuvenate](https://nmcg.nic.in/NamamiGanga.aspx)(‘Namami Gange Programme’, is an Integrated Conservation Mission, approved as ‘Flagship Programme’ by the Union Government in June 2014 with budget outlay of Rs.20,000 Crore to accomplish the twin objectives of effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of National River Ganga.) the river Ganga.
1.7.3.1.4. Pro: Alongside the Namami Gange Programme \(NGP\), PM Modi also set up a National Ganga Council as the overseeing authority. [The National Mission for Clean Ganga \(NMCG\) was formed as the implementing agency](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20210329-ode-to-a-sacred-river-1781262-2021-03-21) which would focus on rejuvenating the entire main stem rather than a few cities on its banks.
1.7.3.2. Pro: PM Modi's government has promoted the provision and use of renewable and efficient energy in India.
