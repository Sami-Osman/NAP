Discussion Name: When a democracy gets invaded and there is very little hope of victory, should the government surrender?

1. When a democracy gets invaded by an autocracy and there is very little hope of victory, the government should surrender early to protect their civilians instead of continuing the fight.
1.1. Pro: If democracy should be fought for with little regard for futility, then this discussion will endorse more wars and insurrection in a broader context than is apparent, even against many countries which claim to be democratic.
1.1.1. Pro: The extent to which one may wage war against anti-democratic authorities is the extent to which many of the supposedly democratic nations ought be attacked from within by rebels who support [real](https://www.kialo.com/will-liquid-democracy-be-a-better-mechanism-of-governance-than-representative-democracy-7865?path=7865.0~7865.1) or [superior](https://www.kialo.com/an-anarchist-society-is-preferable-43725?path=43725.0~43725.3) democratic processes. Thus, by opposing this thesis, one recommends numerous stable countries have potentially endless insurrectionary activity.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The main thesis would commonly be interpreted as supporting or opposing the wars like those in Ukraine. However, as with many of these wars for democracies, these democracies are themselves barely democratic or are even overtly corrupted puppet states. Thus, whether the main thesis is true or not it may have few or no real world uses other than supporting many insurrections in so called "democratic" governments towards real democratic processes.
1.2. Pro: Conditional surrender is an option where the consequences of unconditional surrender are too disasterous.
1.3. Pro: Surrendering will reduce the casualties.
1.3.1. Con: Surrendering does not necessarily reduce the casualties.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Surrendering may embolden the aggressor to expand their invasion to other countries, thus increasing the number of potential casualties.
1.3.1.2. Con: According to a 2021 report, [68% of the world’s population lives under an autocratic governmental system](https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2021/12/autocracy-not-just-some-other-countrys-problem/)(The 21st century has proven problematic for democracy around the world. The last decade has seen a steady deterioration of democratic governance in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. According to the recently released fifth annual Democracy Report “Autocratization Turns Viral” written by the University of Gothenburg V-Dem Institute, 68% of the world’s population lives under an autocratic governmental system. The report found a significant decline of liberal democracies around the world in the past decade dropping from 41 countries to 32.), which shows that surrendering to autocracies seems to be the norm.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Having your own country's government be or become autocratic is not the same thing as surrendering to an invading foreign power with an autocratic government, and we should not expect the outcomes to be the same.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Around the world in the year 2021, [full democracies only represented 6.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
1.3.1.3. Pro: Rather than surrendering, securing alliances with other developed countries could be more successful in decreasing the number of casualties.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: It is much harder to make an alliance when you are currently being invaded, and the nation necessarily failed then in order to be in this situation, so this is implausible.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Before events would transpire, it is important for the government of a certain nation to make ties with stronger and developed countries to avoid certain issues.
1.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: A country that had made alliances with a stronger country and thereby prevented an invasion is irrelevant to the question under discussion.
1.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: When a nation is invaded, most of the resources are spent in defensive actions and peace talks. Alliances can only come in times of peace.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Surrendering may leave the civilian populace of a nation vulnerable to war crimes and persecution, as they would no longer have an organized defense force.
1.3.2. Con: While surrendering might reduce casualties, it could also worsen [the quality of life and the rights of its citizen in the long-term](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/global)(Because they dislike human rights scrutiny, autocratic leaders also tend to retreat from the defense of human rights beyond their borders.).
1.3.3. Pro: Failing to avoid predictable and needless casualties is tantamount to causing them, which no democracy can justify.
1.3.3.1. Pro: If a moral actor knows that their action or inaction will result in an unjustifiable effect and still does it, they are directly or indirectly intending it to happen, which makes them morally responsible.
1.3.4. Pro: Surrendering would also limit the damage to critical infrastructure such as bridges and power stations that often come with war.
1.4. Con: The government should fight to defend their liberal democracy.
1.4.1. Con: It does not make sense to fight in a war with little hope of victory.
1.4.1.1. Con: Guerilla resistance can [weaken](https://www.britannica.com/topic/guerrilla-warfare/Strategy-and-tactics)(The broad strategy underlying successful guerrilla warfare is that of protracted harassment accomplished by extremely subtle, flexible tactics designed to wear down the enemy. The time gained is necessary either to develop sufficient military strength to defeat the enemy forces in orthodox battle \(as did Mao in China\) or to subject the enemy to internal and external military and political pressures sufficient to cause him to seek peace favourable to the guerrillas \(as the Algerian guerrillas did to France, the Angolan and Mozambican guerrillas to Portugal, and the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong to the United States\).) an invading country's resolve as time goes on, allowing the opportunity for smaller countries to prevail.
1.4.2. Con: Not all governments have a military ready to get [involved in large wars](https://rollcall.com/2018/02/05/military-not-ready-for-the-next-larger-war-experts-say/).
1.4.3. Pro: [The military's role is to secure freedom](https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/freedom/howe-military-and-freedom.html), therefore if a democracy gets invaded, the military should fight for the nation's freedom.
1.4.3.1. Con: If a [government with minuscule military](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-without-a-military) would fight, then the whole democracy would get worse due to the gigantic amount of military coming from the opposing nation.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The military also has an [important role in nation-building](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA448657).
1.5. Con: The diversity of various geopolitical factors means that there is no singular yes-or-no answer.
1.5.1. Pro: War aims: an invader might have various designs on the whole country, or only be seeking to \(re\)take disputed territories on the border. They might even be merely invading the country due to alliances, with their actual war aims elsewhere.
1.5.2. Pro: Different governments: Napoleon's France was not Nazi Germany, and the prospect of "surrender to protect civilians" is different for different invaders.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Different aggressors may desire different outcomes. Where Napoleon sought to increase colonial power, Nazi Germany sought the extermination of multiple groups of people. While both are bad, one is undeniably worse than the other.
1.5.3. Pro: Alliances: a country might be part of an alliance which can continue the war after they're knocked out, or it might be fighting alone.
1.5.3.1. Con: Even if alliances can continue the war, the outcompeted, invaded democracy is still better placed to surrender to protect its own citizens because there is no guarantee that remaining allies will be successful.
1.5.4. Con: Geopolitical factors are important in deciding to participate in a war, but when invasion is imminent, the only geopolitical factor that should be considered is defense.
1.5.5. Con: In a democracy, citizens should have the primary voice and decide if they want to surrender or to fight invasion.
1.5.5.1. Pro: In order to fight a successful war, it requires that [soldiers choose to fight as a unit rather than flee](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/zhukov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2017/07/2017_LehmannZhukov_Surrender_201706.pdf)(surrender\nemerges from a collective action problem: success in battle requires that soldiers choose to fight as a unit rather than flee, but individual decisions to fight\ndepend on whether soldiers expect their comrades to do the same.).
1.5.5.2. Con: Even if citizens' opinions are important, in a democracy politicians have been democratically chosen to take important decisions on behalf of a nation based on their expertise.
1.6. Con: Surrendering to the enemy will diminish the glory of the nation.
1.6.1. Pro: Having a sense of national glory is important for building patriotism.
1.6.1.1. Pro: During WWII, patriotism had a [unifying effect](http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/makingmodernus/exhibits/show/wwiamericanhomefront/wwihomefrontpatriotism) on the population.
1.6.1.2. Con: Patriotism - a form of nationalism - is itself [associated with war](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/06/19/how-significant-is-nationalism-as-a-cause-of-war/)(Nationalism has the potential to be either a direct or indirect cause of war.), so should not be treated as a good in itself.
1.6.2. Con: The 'glory of the nation' is an intangible concept and probably deeply subjective. Therefore, it is hard to either ascertain what 'national glory' demands, or if it will be achieved.
1.6.3. Con: There is no glory in a government allowing their citizens to die in a hopeless war. It would bring more glory to a nation to save as many of its people as possible.
1.7. Pro: A democracy should put the benefits of civilians above the glory of the nation.
1.7.1. Con: It is uncertain if allowing an autocracy to be instated would be beneficial for civilians.
1.7.1.1. Pro: In an [autocracy](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-autocracy-definition-and-examples-5082078), contrary to a democracy, citizens have no voice and they are not represented, therefore decisions might not be taken in their best interest.
1.7.2. Pro: [A democracy should protect its citizens](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/democracy) by promoting human rights, development, and peace and security.
1.7.2.1. Con: An elected government is the [best protector of peace and security](https://www.thoughtco.com/democratic-peace-theory-4769410). Surrendering to an unelected aggressor erodes that protection.
1.7.3. Pro: Sovereignty and national self-determination are man-made constructs, whereas individual rights are natural and inalienable.
