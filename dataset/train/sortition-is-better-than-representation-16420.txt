Discussion Name: Sortition is Better than Representation

1. Sortition is Better than Representation
1.1. Con: Sortition may result in professional bureaucrats having too much power.
1.1.1. Con: This could be negated by laws and policies surrounding the 'elected' officials.
1.1.2. Con: [Professional bureaucrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thick_of_It) are considered to have [too much power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister) under representative democracy.
1.1.3. Pro: Elected officials that have no experience in politics may rely a lot on the knowledge of professional bureaucrats thus giving unelected officials too much power.
1.1.3.1. Con: Elected officials who have no experience of politics may bring fresh new approaches to government.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Experienced politicians simultaneously welcome the security of bureaucratic status quo and publically blame it for their own failure to bring about change.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Experience politicians and political bureaucrats have a symbiotic interest in maintaining current government mechanisms of power.
1.2. Con: Sortition allows for unqualified individuals to be elected to positions of responsibility.
1.2.1. Con: Career politicians act out of duty, vocation or interest, which are better than doing something just because you have been randomly selected to do it.
1.2.1.1. Con: Randomly selected citizens have no vested interests in the outcomes of decisions they make. No upcoming election to please someone.
1.2.1.2. Con: Politicians may start out with a feeling of duty, but after a while the party politics and vested interests \(that pay for them to get elected\) waste away at that, and they become a cog in the machine.
1.2.1.3. Con: Randomly selected citizens have a civic duty and are proud of the outcomes they decide upon in a deliberative manner
1.2.2. Pro: Politicians need to be trained, otherwise their policies would be dangerous and probably disastrous.
1.2.2.1. Con: Most cabinet members are not specialised in that field. Occasionally a government chooses industry exposed, experienced people, but mostly just senior politicians. [Report on effectiveness of Ministers](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Challenge%20of%20Being%20a%20Minister.pdf)
1.2.2.2. Con: Politicians are not trained
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Politicians are not trained for the job they have to do. Logic, Ethics, Environmental Sciences, Energy Economics and many more are needed for the correct interpretation and adoption of policies.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Some of them are [trained in how to do the job](https://www.indy100.com/article/eton-college-entrance-exam-question-army-killing-protesters-private-school-9090156).
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Politicians need to have knowledge on how to help people, and thus need superior education which most politicians have.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Too many politicians are career politicians: school, Uni, Internship, political ladder. Some life experience outside of the elite bubbles would help us all.
1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: [2/3rds](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/private-school-boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle-ministers-sutton-trust-eton-college-a9020266.html) of the current UK cabinet went to private school.
1.2.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: The education of career politicians has [very little](https://www.indy100.com/article/eton-college-entrance-exam-question-army-killing-protesters-private-school-9090156) to do with helping people.
1.2.2.3. Con: Most sortition examples maintain Minister and similar level politicians in them for leading the country, creating vision and figuring out what questions to ask the sortition based jury.
1.2.3. Con: Sortition is used for decision making, not to fill cabinet roles.
1.2.4. Con: You need [no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidential_qualifications_by_country) [qualifications](https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/office-descriptions.pdf) to stand for [office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Germany) in a representative democracy.
1.3. Con: Sortition can lead to really bad outcomes if the wrong people are randomly chosen.
1.3.1. Pro: The whole point of public policy and governance is acute acumen in a particular domain to direct society in some progressive direction. Sortition without a preliminary filtering of people possessing some characteristics to that effect, is worse than representation as there's neither the assent of a populace nor is there a particularly beneficial skill set that's brought to the table. This can result in unstable polity/government in that society.
1.3.1.1. Con: The acute acumen is provided by the administrators. The point of governance is to balance competing interests across specialist areas.
1.3.2. Con: There is no such thing as people who are 'wrong' in a democracy - only people you disagree with. The aim of democracy is to incorporate competing positions in to decision making.
1.3.3. Con: Sortition done right has a wide cross section of the public that as a whole are more smart than most. [qz.com](https://qz.com/960175/cognitive-science-shows-that-humans-are-smarter-as-a-group-than-they-are-on-their-own/)
1.3.4. Pro: If people with criminal intent are randomly chosen, that can lead to corruption, nepotism and illegal activity.
1.3.4.1. Con: Representative democracy is [susceptible to corruption](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/big-tobacco-funding-conservatives-nhs-hancock-raab-davis-a8916561.html).
1.3.4.2. Con: Representative democracy is [susceptible](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36260573) to [nepotism](http://flip.it/swUaJ2) .
1.3.4.3. Con: Representative democracy is [no guarantee against illegal activity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal).
1.4. Pro: Sortition is economically beneficial: it eliminates the costs of elections and campaigns and reduces the overall costs of the political apparatus.
1.5. Pro: Sortition decreases the amount of polls and interaction needed between a representative and the public.
1.5.1. Con: Polls and interaction with the public are still necessary: a random group of citizens may not be representative of the whole electorate and the issues they face.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Sortition would reduce the number of newspaper commissioned polls aimed at generating misleading headlines.
1.5.1.2. Con: The existing method of polling uses a random selection of people that answer polls. It does not represent people's opinions either. Sortition at least has a chance that mote people facing an issue will be asked a serious question
1.5.2. Con: Reducing the amount of interaction between the public and officials is not necessarily a good thing in a democratic system.
1.5.3. Pro: Polls are hugely inaccurate
1.5.4. Pro: Polls are media driven
1.5.5. Pro: Polling and interaction is only done on the "hot" issues, not all the important issues
1.6. Pro: Sortition would make people engage with the political system in a more meaningful way.
1.6.1. Pro: Sortition may bring more comprehensible and less complex laws, more understandable and accessible to the public.
1.6.2. Con: Some authors consider that "the small chance of a citizen being sampled into a high powered body, or even knowing someone on such a body" may lead to people to become [uninterested](https://equalitybylot.com/2016/06/22/griffiths-seven-potential-problems-with-sortition/) in politics.
1.6.3. Con: With elections, the public has a chance to politically participate, whit sortition, there is none.
1.6.3.1. Con: There are [all sorts](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/political-participation) of methods of political engagement and participation.
1.6.3.2. Con: Voting as a proxy for political participation prevents people from understanding their role as an active agent citizen in a evolving socio-political environment.
1.6.4. Pro: In order to perform their tasks competently, people would have to be much more educated on the process of governance than they are now.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Sortition based systems educate people on Governance, and encourage active participation after they have participated in a sortition based decision. [Citizen Voices research paper](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/docs/researchpapers/Citizens%20Voices%20Experiments%20in%20Democratic%20Renewal%20and%20Reform.pdf)
1.6.5. Con: Only a very tiny number of people.
1.7. Pro: Sortition avoids the problems of gerrymandering found in both direct and representative democracy.
1.7.1. Con: Laws can be implemented to avoid [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#International_examples_of_gerrymandering).
1.7.1.1. Con: UK constituencies have been [gerrymandered](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/transformations/gis/papers/dannydorling_publication_id1322.pdf) for over 100 years, but it is a very slow process, if not impossible, to change them.
1.7.1.2. Pro: While a problem in the US, there are plenty of countries that do not have that issue because the [system](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/07/the-supreme-court-will-soon-consider-gerrymandering-heres-how-changes-in-redistricting-could-reduce-it/?utm_term=.1169b8610e9a) works differently.
1.7.2. Con: Representation doesn't pull people out of their careers & force them into office.
1.7.2.1. Con: Sortition can be made a voluntary thing.
1.7.3. Con: Sortition can be made to be discriminatory.
1.7.3.1. Con: Sortition can just as easily be design to no be discriminatory. The Greeks only let Male Land owners be chosen. Today we would allow any gender, any race, any background, and most systems ensure a full cross section that represents society is chosen.
1.7.4. Con: Representation increases the accountability of the representatives.
1.7.4.1. Con: Most representatives only represent the vested interests of themselves or the people that "put" them into power
1.7.5. Con: Representation allows for career politicians.
1.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.8. Pro: Sortition virtually eliminates the need for dishonest career politicians.
1.8.1. Con: It also eliminates the experience, know-how and willingness of honest politicians.
1.8.1.1. Con: The percentage of honest, hard working politicians is so low in the major parties this is not relevant.
1.8.2. Con: Career politicians are better politicians because they get trained in politics.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Career politicians are better prepared since they need to [battle](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-23437111) other candidates.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: They may need also need to go through assessments processes and be approved by other members of their party, when they are deemed ready and experienced enough.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the UK, for example, Liberal Democrats and Conservatives go through [assessment processes](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-23437111) that are  difficult as well as very professionalized and based on competency.
1.8.2.1.2. Con: They are often previously consultants \(or post government\) in the private sector \(ie. lobbyist, managers, well connected board members\)
1.8.2.2. Con: Most politicians are there by default, they just happen to rise to the top after x years of experience.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: Before being able to be elected in a representative democracy, most politicians spend years facing internal processes in which they have to demonstrate negotiating skills and charisma to rise within their parties. Sortition candidates have none of that training.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.1.
1.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: François [Mitterrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand#Political_career), the longest-serving French president, was a successful strategist who combined different political influences: a conservative and Catholic upbringing, his time serving under the Vichy Regime, a participation in the Nazi resistance and a successful political career in the Socialist Party.
1.8.2.2.1.3. Pro: Before being elected \(1982\), former Spanish President [Felipe González](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Gonz%C3%A1lez#Early_life) became a member of the clandestine socialist party and was elected its Secretary General once. He had a decisive role during the Spanish transition to democracy and became a member of Congress \(1977\).
1.8.2.2.1.4. Con: Sortition candidates would not fall into the 'groupthink' that career politicians suffer from.
1.8.2.2.1.5. Con: Sortition candidates would not spend a lot of their efforts fighting to get re-elected.
1.8.3. Pro: Career politicians are often from the same background and social extraction, virtually creating an elite distant from the citizens.
1.8.3.1. Pro: For Aristotle, selecting the people's political representatives by lot instead of voting distinguished democracy from [oligarchical rule](https://mises.org/wire/forget-electoral-democracy-%E2%80%94-give-demarchy-chance).
1.8.3.2. Pro: Democracy allows for powerful groups that protect their position despite the entire adult population having the right to vote. So "the [establishment](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/26/the-establishment-uncovered-how-power-works-in-britain-elites-stranglehold) represents an attempt on behalf of these groups to 'manage' democracy, to make sure that it does not threaten their own interests".
1.8.3.3. Pro: In the UK, 29% of MPs in 2017’s Parliament were [privately educated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/election-2017-mps-more-than-half-comprehensive-schools-state-education-labour-tory-study-a7783571.html) and one in ten MPs had attended Eton, one of the UK’s most exclusive public schools.
1.8.3.4. Pro: In the US, the total [wealth of members of Congress](https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/every-member-congress-wealth-one-chart) was $2.43 billion, 20% more than the collective riches of the previous Congress, a significant gain.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.8.5. Pro: No more lying to the public, or twisting the truth.
1.8.5.1. Pro: One of the key tasks of the leadership would be to explain the complexity and difficulty of the decisions they are required to make.
1.9. Con: Sortition could cause inconsistency in government competence.
1.9.1. Con: The consistency in competence would be provided by a strong, professional, civil service as supposedly happens in representative democracy.
1.9.2. Con: Sortition could allow 'hand over' of accumulated experience and wisdom by having rolling changes within the members as opposed to all change at one go.
1.9.3. Con: In the UK Sortition could form one 'house' whilst representatives of devolved regional assemblies could also form a parallel house -with overlaping rresponsibilities as proposed in Italy.
1.9.3.1. Con: It would be like juries. Randomly picked -with outliers rejected. They start with no knowledge of a case and can spend months on it. If there was a problem that affected the jury the judge may call for a complete change, but the case has to start all over again as the accumulated knowledge and opinions of the previous set have been lost.
1.9.4. Pro: Random selection, from the electorate as one pool, could result in all scientists or all athletes , all artists or all school dropouts. Each would have dramatically different competencies or none.
1.9.4.1. Con: A 'sampling frame' could be established to represent the make-up of the nation as a whole. This might need to work on three or more axes but the techniques are already in daily use by Market Research companies and by Government.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: A "sampling frame", akin to qualifying citizens in hierarchic categories, may be seen as non-democratic and against sortition own values.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.2.1.
1.9.6. Con: There are already high levels of inconsistency in government competence.
1.9.6.1. Pro: The Conservative Government which since the 2008 crash has varied from a strong management \(even if incorrect\) under [Cameron](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/david-cameron)/[Osbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne) through a weak solitary performer \([Theresa May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May)\) to a minority Government with no focus . Now \(Sept 2019\) it has strong focus \(Brexit now, election afterwards\) and a team approach with [Boris Johnson](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/boris-johnson) at the top acting in a more Chairman-like method.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: There is a stark difference in competencies of individuals in UK Parliament over the years. The current cabinet has very [little](https://www.bing.com/search?q=priti+patel&form=EDGNB2&mkt=en-gb&httpsmsn=1&plvar=0&refig=a7d160f7d7324202b50b92cce1ac7323&sp=-1&ghc=1&pq=priti+patel&sc=8-11&qs=n&sk=&cvid=a7d160f7d7324202b50b92cce1ac7323) experience. This is a marked contrast to the Thatcher years with [experienced people](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Lord+Carrington&form=EDGNB2&mkt=en-gb&httpsmsn=1&plvar=0&refig=72ba6a1f89c74c03b8e2f3c0808da546&sp=-1&ghc=1&pq=lord+carrington&sc=8-15&qs=n&sk=&cvid=72ba6a1f89c74c03b8e2f3c0808da546) working on foreign policy \(Zimbabwe, [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Patten), Falklands, the eu concessions \) as well as UK problems \(industry, strikes, Council Tax\). The Thatcher team was wrong on policies but strong in individual competence.
1.9.6.2. Pro: [Chris Grayling](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/chris-grayling-fails) is "a one-man catastrophe magnet" who has cost the UK £2.3bn in six years as a cabinet minister.
1.9.6.3. Pro: [Alexander](https://youtu.be/C9MUwBEJRwk) [Boris](https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/times-boris-johnson-flat-lied/) [de Pfeffel](https://www.indy100.com/article/boris-johnson-jo-brexit-cabinet-no-deal-second-referendum-9020431) [Johnson](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/18/bridge-940m-bill-boris-johnsons-mayora-vanity-projects-garden-bridge-routemaster-bus) is a habitual liar, nepotist, incompetent liability and nasty piece of work.
1.9.6.4. Pro: [Esther McVey](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/esther-mcvey-universal-credit-spending-nao-false-statements-lies-national-audit-office-a8430356.html) lied to the House of Commons.
1.9.6.5. Pro: [Dominic Raab](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/08/dominic-raab-britain-island-ignorance-brexit-secretary) was unaware of the most very basic information about this country.
1.9.6.6. Pro: [Karen Bradley](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/karen-bradley-admits-not-understanding-northern-irish-politics) was unaware of the most very basic information needed to approach her job.
1.9.6.7. Pro: [David Davies](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/7-times-tory-david-davis-11649452) is either incompetent or a liar.
1.9.6.8. Pro: [Priti](http://Priti Patel forced to resign over unofficial meetings with Israelis https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-forced-to-resign-over-unofficial-meetings-with-israelis?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard) [Patel](http://Priti Patel accused of breaching ministerial code for second time https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/priti-patel-accused-of-breaching-ministerial-code-for-second-time?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard) has twice breached ministerial code.
1.9.6.9. Pro: As education secretary, [Nicky Morgan](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11221081/Nicky-Morgan-pupils-held-back-by-overemphasis-on-arts.html) said that too many students were studying art. She is now culture secretary.
1.9.6.10. Pro: [Sajid Javid](http://John McDonnell questions chancellor's suitability for office https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/john-mcdonnell-questions-chancellors-suitability-for-office?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard), Chancellor of the Exchequer, profited from the greed that caused the 2008 financial crisis.
1.10. Con: The people 'elected' may not want to govern.
1.10.1. Pro: The people elected \(by random selection\) have no incentive to try to do anything, let alone doing "good".
1.10.2. Con: People selected for jury service would often prefer not to do it. It is their duty.
1.10.2.1. Con: Regardless of being a mandatory duty, there is the question if it is good that those who govern do so against their will.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: People having to do something they do not want to do, may lead them to do the bare minimum and have no passion or vocation for what they are doing.
1.10.2.1.1.1. Con: The magnitude of the responsibility of the job is like to ensure that most people do the best that they are capable of.
1.10.2.1.1.2. Con: It is undesirable for people to govern based on their passions. Government requires sober and rational deliberation to choose actions that will lead to outcomes that will benefit society.
1.10.2.1.1.3. Con: Structures would be in place to support those selected to hold power.
1.10.3. Con: [Plato said](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/912336) - only those who do not seek power are qualified to hold it.
1.10.3.1. Pro: So did [Dumbledore](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/77617-it-is-a-curious-thing-harry-but-perhaps-those-who).
1.11. Pro: Sortition would ensure laws passed are in line with what the people want.
1.11.1. Pro: Sortition is more likely than any other system to produce representative bodies that are [sociologically representative](https://equalitybylot.com/2016/06/22/griffiths-seven-potential-problems-with-sortition/)of the people.
1.11.2. Pro: This is necessary because in the US, laws are 30% likely to pass, regardless of public opinion according to [Princeton](https://www.upworthy.com/20-years-of-data-reveals-that-congress-doesnt-care-what-you-think).
