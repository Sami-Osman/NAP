Discussion Name: Should we be worried about American democracy under President Trump?

1. Concern about American democracy is appropriate under President Trump.
1.1. Con: Alarmism contributes to hysteria on the left with an intense focus on one man, Donald Trump, which is both a regrettable and dangerous place to be.
1.1.1. Con: Not wanting a racist, sexist president has nothing to do with left or right.
1.1.1.1. Con: Neither racism nor sexism have been actually proven. His presidency celebrated [low black unemployment](https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ac10bb8e91cf8a4fc68261276d6ccd104b444a0d-800x533.jpg), signifying they are actively trying to help minorities. He also gave [women public and high positions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-women-who-ve-got-trump-s-back-n799646).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Though [not conclusively](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/omarosa-trump-book-the-apprentice-memoir) [proven](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/08/15/is-trump-a-racist-you-dont-need-an-n-word-tape-to-know/?utm_term=.77526a23865b), many [still believe](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-omarosa-tapes-n-word-the-apprentice-racist-white-house-us-president-a8486441.html) that he has used the [n-word](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjkam5/poll-most-republicans-think-a-good-president-could-say-the-n-word) and is [probably racist](https://deadline.com/2018/08/white-house-donald-trump-no-guarantee-not-use-n-word-omarosa-dog-not-racial-1202445277/).
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: President Barack Obama [used the word nigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6UwAez8Ko); this does not make him a racist.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many within the Republican party, as well as Trump supporters [simply don't care](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2018/08/15/omarosa-manigault-newman-donald-trump-n-word-sarah-huckabee-sanders/999076002/) if he is racist. This already shows a considerable degrading and erosion of the democratic values America is based on.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Trump may give women high positions, but his [derogatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html) [remarks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/donald-trump-tape.html) and [treatment of women](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-04/billy-bush-says-infamous-access-hollywood-trump-tape-is-real/9224358) is a case of proven [fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape), [not opinion](http://time.com/5047771/donald-trump-comments-billy-bush/).
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Trump has had [multiple](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-melania-stormy-daniels-affairs-marriages-timeline-2018-3) [extra-marital affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal), some within a [year of](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43334326) his children being born. This has been [testified to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels%E2%80%93Donald_Trump_scandal) by his own lawyer, who[plead guilty](https://globalnews.ca/news/4399826/michael-cohen-plea-deal/) to [paying them off](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17765348/michael-cohen-guilty-plea-stormy-daniels-hush-money) with Hush money at Trump's direction. These are not the actions of someone who respects women.
1.1.2. Con: Many prominent conservatives [are critical](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/26/conservative-resistance-rightwingers-trump) of Donald Trump.
1.1.3. Con: The right is just as hysterical. The restraint shown by the left doesn't really benefit the state of America's public discourse \(since it remains hysterical\). [Americans increasingly getting angrier.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/americans-hate-all-the-partisanship-but-theyre-also-more-partisan-than-they-were/2019/10/26/e1f4abe2-f762-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html)
1.1.4. Pro: Problematic as Trump may be, he is the symptom of larger problems in the American political system that made his rise to power possible in the first place.
1.1.5. Con: Accusing the other side of hysteria presumes that it cannot make reasonable arguments, thereby avoiding or making impossible a respectful debate.
1.2. Con: America's democracy is alive and healthy as illustrated by the [highest turnout](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/19/18103110/2018-midterm-elections-turnout) in a midterm election since 1914.
1.2.1. Con: The U.S. trails most developed countries in voter turnout, placing [26th out of 32](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/).
1.3. Con: This level of concern blots out the ability to objectively appreciate positive developments in the country that may be attributed to Trump.
1.3.1. Con: The ability to appreciate positive developments is [not necessarily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32NnRj_j0qs) challenged by acknowledging concerns and/or criticisms done by harmful actions.
1.3.2. Con: The value of this argument is directly tied to the actual accounting of harm versus benefit. If Trump's damage significantly outweighs his benefit to the U.S., citizen concern is entirely justified.
1.3.3. Pro: America's economy has been growing at a [steady and slightly accelerating pace](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth) since Trump was inaugurated in early 2017.
1.3.3.1. Con: This is a fallacy of [Correlation vs Causation.](https://www.iperceptions.com/blog/causation-vs-correlation) The [U.S. economy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/18/trump-economy-versus-obama-economy/?utm_term=.29ad31825b75) has been [steadily growing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2018/10/30/two-charts-show-trumps-job-gains-are-just-a-continuation-from-obamas-presidency/#1c1bdf1e1af3) throughout the entirety of the [Obama administration](https://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/economy/2017/01/06/obama-economy-10-charts-final/index.html); giving Trump credit for this continuing trend is unfounded.
1.3.3.2. Con: Trump's inauguration holds no bearing on economic policy. He didn't even propose a 2017 budget package, meaning his first budget bill didn't effect anything for the [entire first year](https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/22/news/economy/trump-budget/index.html). He also reserved his more [aggressive tax reforms](https://uproxx.com/viral/trump-voters-gop-tax-bill/) until after the 2018 mid-terms, further delaying any tangible impact to the economy.
1.3.3.3. Con: Generally speaking, Presidents often get more [credit/blame](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/donald-trump-economy-stock-market-jobs-reports-credit/) for U.S. economic performance than they deserve.
1.3.3.4. Con: Trump has [expanded](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/03/09/trumps-twin-deficits-are-exploding/#4a48d3a07ffa) both [the](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-national-debt-deficit-compared-to-obama-bush-clinton-2019-2) [debt](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/05/donald-trump-22-trillion-debt-arthur-laffer-matter-editorials-debates/1346801001/) and the [spending](http://fortune.com/2019/04/10/the-deficit-is-growing-far-faster-than-predicted/) [deficit](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-budget-spending-tax-policy-cbo-1413459); this is [demonstrably](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-budget-deficit-hits-record-february-national-debt-2019-3) [damaging](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-budget-deficit-3305783) to the future of U.S. economic performance.
1.3.4. Con: Arguments that presume that the other side's inability to remain objective should be seen critical as they make unwarranted assumptions.
1.4. Con: Any calls for concern are outweighed by the fact that this is the first President in our lifetime who came from outside the political establishment and its entrenched practices.
1.4.1. Con: "Since he paid for it himself, he should be able to do whatever he wants" is not a healthy way to approach things.
1.4.2. Con: The way that the current president has handled the position may inhibit future non-politicians from being able to get the presidency.
1.4.3. Pro: Trump supplemented a significant portion of his campaign expenses with his own funds rather than special interest dollars.
1.4.3.1. Con: Donald Trump's campaign was [about 20%](http://fortune.com/2016/12/09/donald-trump-campaign-spending/) funded by Donald Trump's personal money.
1.4.4. Con: Where the President comes from does not necessarily prove that he is good or bad.
1.4.5. Con: Ronald [Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan), the 40th president, was an actor before becoming a politician.
1.4.6. Con: This is simplistic thinking. The fact that a candidate is "non-establishment" doesn't eliminate the possibility that \(s\)he may be motivated by other interests, such as self-enrichment, promotion of a personal ideology, or even escaping legal difficulties.
1.5. Pro: Donald Trump is a racist. Fundamentally, a racist is against values American democracy is meant to espouse.
1.5.1. Pro: In August 2017, Trump [pardoned Sherrif Joe Arpaio](https://www.kialo.com/in-august-2017-trump-pardonned-sherrif-joe-arpaio-who-the-justice-department-concluded-had-a-horrendous-history-of-9299.126?path=9299.0~9299.1_9299.125_9299.126), who the Justice Department concluded had a horrendous history of racial profiling. He conducted immigration round-ups designed to target anyone who wasn't white. [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/25/donald-trump-joe-arpaio-pardon-arizona-sheriff)
1.5.2. Pro: He is a leading proponent of the conspiracy that Barrack Obama’s birth certificate is African despite all evidence showing otherwise.
1.5.3. Pro: Frequently, he uses [racist rhetoric](https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fnews%2fpolitics%2fwp%2f2018%2f01%2f11%2ftrumps-candidacy-and-presidency-have-been-laced-with-racist-rhetoric%2f%3f&utm_term=.7fa1e0ab9a91).
1.5.3.1. Pro: He has referred to certain black countries as “[shitholes](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/immigrants-shithole-countries-trump/index.html),” and prioritised immigration from ethnically white parts of the world.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: "Shithole country" is not nice or appropriate language. But jumping to the conclusion that ethnicity had anything to do with the statement is hearsay at best. Corruption, violent crime, and poverty are things that these countries have in common.
1.5.4. Pro: Historically, ethnic intolerance by democratic leaders has lead to authoritarian regimes being established.
1.5.5. Con: Donald Trump is not a racist. This is a fabrication promulgated by a propagandist press, lying public leaders, and people desiring to believe the worst of Donald Trump. Therefore, the concern is unwarranted.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Donald Trump [sued](https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/katy/opinion/article/Trump-insisted-on-including-Jews-blacks-at-Palm-9702222.php) Broward county to permit [Jews and Blacks](https://spectator.org/64643_when-trump-fought-racists/) into Mara Lago country club
1.5.5.2. Pro: Donald Trump's [support among Blacks grew](https://www.westernjournal.com/trumps-support-among-year/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=westernjournalism&utm_content=2018-01-16&utm_campaign=manualpost) during his presidency. A racist would not grow in popularity among Blacks.
1.5.5.3. Pro: The media, Congressional leaders, and popular culture icons [lied about Trump's actual statements](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/08/06/america_is_drowning_in_the_lefts_lies_about_trump_140950.html) about Charleston. He never supported White supremacists.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Trump criticized anyone ruthlessly, irrespective of their color, creed, or nationality. This demonstrates a lack of racism, not racism itself.
1.6. Pro: Donald Trump has shown support for authoritarian actions.
1.6.1. Pro: Donald Trump expressed [admiration for the Chinese government's response to Tiananmen Square](https://www.businessinsider.com/trumpn-tiananmen-square-massacre-china-showed-power-of-strength-2019-6?r=US&IR=T), calling the murder of protestors evidence of the "power of strength".
1.6.1.1. Con: This statement comes from a [1990 interview](https://www.businessinsider.com/trumpn-tiananmen-square-massacre-china-showed-power-of-strength-2019-6?r=US&IR=T), which happened twenty-six years before Donald Trump became President. It's extremely likely for one's political views to change over a period of more than two decades.
1.6.2. Pro: Trumps disparaging of the election process, especially in [Arizona](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1060993836984324096) and Florida, shows a testing of his ability to create distrust in the results of a valid election - potentially trying to [set the stage for calling into question the integrity of the 2020 election if he loses](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/18/is-donald-trump-an-authoritarian-experts-examine-telltale-signs).
1.6.3. Pro: US presidents have the ability to bypass the rest of government using Executive Orders. This is a step closer to authoritarianism than some other systems, as it centralises power. Trump's executive orders per year are [higher than those of any President since 1989.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_executive_orders#Consolidated_list_by_President)
1.6.3.1. Con: Donald trump, at 46.4 per year, is nowhere near the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt at over 300 per year.
1.6.4. Con: President Trump never supported authoritarianism through actions, in spite of his rhetoric.
1.7. Pro: Donald Trump [consistently](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/freedom-press/donald-trump-thinks-freedom-press-disgusting) [attacks](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1140252528304631808) the free press, something that is very important for the preservation of democracy.
1.7.1. Con: Donald Trump has criticized the free press, but never tried to silence media outlets he disagreed with.
1.7.2. Con: The free press consistently [attacks](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/28/media-needs-to-come-clean-about-hate-for-president/) donald trump.
1.8. Con: The constitutional checks and balances are well able to constrain a Trump Presidency should it go above and beyond what it is legally allowed to do.
1.8.1. Pro: The filibuster, a hotly contested motion within the Senate, is often used to ensure that controversial or potentially destructive legislation requires a "supermajority" to vote on. Opponents to specific legislation will filibuster to delay a vote and make a bill's progress slow down to as long as the speaker can continue to speak.
1.8.2. Con: The Republican Party has shown itself to be unwilling to hold the president accountable for his actions, thereby circumventing the traditional checks and balances that we have depended upon.
1.8.3. Con: If Congress, the Courts, and elections are compromised then Constitutional checks and balances may be non-existent.
1.8.3.1. Con: While he has been trying to turn the government in his favour, the overwhelming democrat win in 2018 shows that this has been largely unsuccesful, despite his attempts.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Donald Trump has been appointing [laughably unqualified](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/15/opinions/trump-judge-nominee-petersen-bad-day-callan-opinion/index.html) judges [based on their loyalty to him](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/when-loyalty-fails/552146/) rather than their legal expertise.
1.8.3.3. Pro: Various parts of the [senate](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/09/politics/devin-nunes-trump-congress-republican-majority/index.html) and congress have proven [partisan](https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article216443225.html) "[Party over Country](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/9/17670930/devin-nunes-tape)" and [do not seek](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/09/devin-nunes-in-secretly-recorded-tape-tells-donors-gop-majority-is-necessary-to-protect-trump-were-the-only-ones/?utm_term=.cf5c7e9450b4) to [curb or restrain Trump's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/08/devin-nunes-audio-protecting-trump-rosenstein-impeachment-timing/943636002/) excesses, but rather [shield and protect him](https://nypost.com/2018/08/09/nunes-secretly-recorded-at-fundraiser-we-have-to-protect-trump-from-mueller/), giving him free reign and [immunity](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1001584/Devin-Nunes-Donald-Trump-Mueller-Russian-inquiry-mid-terms).
1.8.3.4. Pro: Trumps latest selection for [supreme Justice](https://www.justsecurity.org/59356/setting-record-straight-brett-kavanaughs-views-criminal-investigation-president/) is [controversial](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/03/brett-kavanaugh-controversial-supreme-court-nominee-five-reasons/1143100002/) at best and seen by many as an [attempt to](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17551584/brett-kavanaugh-president-criminal-investigation) [stack the deck](https://www.thenation.com/article/brett-kavanaugh-argued-sitting-president-law/) and [protect himself](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/10/trump-scotus-pick-kavanaugh-favors-shielding-presidents-from-probes.html).
1.8.3.4.1. Pro: The call for an FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh's alleged past misconduct, while welcome, has been [severely curtailed and limited](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6261661/The-White-House-DID-limit-FBI-probe-Kavanaugh-sex-claims-says-bureaus-director.html) by Trump and the White House, to the point of being almost useless and pointless.
1.8.4. Pro: The Trump administration's travel ban for various countries deemed unsafe was [challenged and blocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_challenges_to_the_Trump_travel_ban) by various courts, showing that America's constitutional safeguards work.
1.8.4.1. Con: While the checks and balances do work, in some situations they don't and can't work fast enough. In the case of the travel ban, the executive action had powerful impacts on the lives of many before it was overturned.
1.8.5. Con: All Trump has to do is appoint justices who are more loyal to their party than to the Constitution, and the definition of what he is "legally allowed to do" may suddenly change.
1.8.5.1. Con: Trump spent the majority of his campaign mocking and insulting his fellow Republicans. It is very unlikely that his "party" is loyal to him in anyway. They merely saw him as the lesser of two evils.
1.9. Pro: President Trump is a Commander in Chief who cannot and/or will not defend America from election interference, particularly that which continues to be perpetrated by Russia.
1.9.1. Con: The White House has [formally accused](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-blames-russia-for-massive-2017-cyberattack-1518736888) Russia of the NotPetya attacks as soon as evidence for them has surfaced. This shows that they take credible threats to security seriously.
1.9.1.1. Con: An accusation via a public statement isn't action. The Trump administration has done little of substance to actually improve the security of American elections.
1.9.2. Con: The integrity of elections is the responsibility of the individual states. The federal government was purposefully not given that responsibility.
1.9.3. Pro: President Trump has not articulated a public policy of deterrence, one that promises retribution by the US in response to election interference campaigns and other cyber-attacks.
1.9.3.1. Pro: The “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act \(CAATSA\)” was passed into law nearly unanimously through congress and signed into law by President Trump in August of 2016. Trump in late January of 2018 [refused to implement the sanctions authorized by the law](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-russia-sanctions-trump-no-new-congress-law-election-hacking-intervention-putin-kremlin-a8184866.html).
1.9.4. Pro: President Trump's choice to [trust the words](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/11/politics/president-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-election-meddling/index.html) of Vladimir Putin, leader of a rival great power nation state, over the data accumulated and judgments rendered by the US intelligence community [via a broad consensus](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-russia-elections/u-s-2018-elections-under-attack-by-russia-u-s-intelligence-chief-idUSKCN1FX1Z8) is troubling.
1.9.5. Con: Actually it was the Obama admin \(not Trump\) who knew of the foreign interference and did nothing of consequence.[An upcoming Senate report is expected to slam Obama's response to Russian election meddling](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/senate-report-expected-to-slam-obama-response-to-russian-meddling.html)[Obama knew about Russia election meddling, did nothing](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/obama-knew-about-russia-election-interference-did-nothing-trump)
1.10. Pro: President Trump continues to undermine the judiciary and its role within America's democracy.
1.10.1. Pro: President Trump has repeatedly referred to the criminal investigations by the Justice Department and the FBI as a "[disgrace](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-blames-justice-department-and-fbi-for-conduct-he-says-was-a-disgrace.html)" and a "[hoax](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-blames-justice-department-and-fbi-for-conduct-he-says-was-a-disgrace.html)".
1.10.2. Pro: President Trump's firing of James Comey was motivated by the President's desire to instigate an expedient conclusion to the investigation into the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia. The firing represents a \(potentially unlawful\) obstruction of the work of a public law enforcement agent.
1.10.2.1. Con: Since it has been proven that Comey [lied under oath](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/18/trump-comey-lied-protected-hillary-clinton-243897), his behaviour was unsuitable to remain as head of the FBI. This behaviour includes his interference [in the](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/02/hillary-clinton-trump-election-loss-russia-fbi-interference) [2016 elections](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/09/james-comey-fbi-fired-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-emails). It might be his bad leadership that led to Trump's election in the first place.
1.10.3. Con: The Judiciary is secure, and independent. Trump's twitter criticisms have no influence and the Executive Branch has complied with all judicial rulings that did not turn in their favor \(travel ban, DACA, etc.\).
1.11. Pro: Trump and the GOP promote conspiracy theories and place party and power over country and principle, leading to an [erosion of morals](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russias-state-tv-calls-trump-151254712.html) and more importantly democracy. this even leads to classic enemies and rivals referring to them as "their agents".
1.11.1. Con: Most 'conspiracy theories' were proven real and the media downplays it and spreads disinformation so that trump has less support.
1.11.2. Con: The conspiracy theory about Obama's birth certificate was begun by [Hillary Clinton's staff](https://twitter.com/MoElleithee/status/776808154621444096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E776808154621444096%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fpolitics%2F2016%2F09%2F16%2Fhillary-clinton-campaign-manager-admits-birtherism-started%2F).
1.11.3. Con: No example is stronger than places party and power over the country than eliminating the filibuster, federalizing elections, legalizing fraudulent election practices, adding WAshington as a State, passing a $2 trillion bill with no votes from the opposition.
1.11.4. Con: Morals were eroded in the 1960's by today's Democrats.
1.12. Pro: Donald Trump severely lacks literacy, which should be considered a critical competency necessary to govern.
1.12.1. Con: President Trump went to an elite military school, earning academic honors. He studied Islam, [Socrates, Aristotle, and Logic at Fordham University](https://fordhamobserver.com/30994/news/inside-trumps-days-at-fordham/?fbclid=IwAR0ZkPGneBrCUGFL3yqPQhjvRQArZE3W6ZzKrWWy3aI4xurIOg9UzvOrwYQ). He graduated from Wharton. He concluded billion-dollar-deals, signed Bills, Acts, Treaties, and Executive Orders as the president. It is implausible to think he did all this without understanding what is written.
1.12.1.1. Con: As [Trump is blocking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherrim/2019/02/28/heres-why-donald-trump-doesnt-want-anyone-to-know-his-grades-or-sat-scores/#6b8ac2e23764) [the release](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/grab-that-record-how-trumps-high-school-transcript-was-hidden/2019/03/05/8815b7b8-3c61-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html) [of his grades](https://time.com/5540152/donald-trump-michael-cohen-academic-records/) [and transcripts](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-high-school-record-academic-obama-new-york-a8809751.html), from [High School](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/report-how-trump-managed-to-bury-his-high-school-transcript.html) [and both Colleges](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2019/09/14/donald-trump-at-wharton-university-of-pennsylvania/), it is [impossible to tell](https://www.quora.com/What-was-Trump%E2%80%99s-GPA-at-Wharton) [how well he actually did](https://www.thedp.com/article/2015/08/donald-trump-wharton-classmates) in these school's and how much he took in. [It is known he lied about his his grades](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-donald-trump-tells-about-donald-trump/2016/01/28/b7cead16-c46e-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html). [It is rumored](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/05/donald-trump-wharton-penn/560309/) he [bribed admissions](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-who-often-boasts-of-his-wharton-degree-says-he-was-admitted-to-the-hardest-school-to-get-into-the-college-official-who-reviewed-his-application-recalls-it-differently/ar-AAE20sq) [officials to attend](https://www.salon.com/2019/07/09/former-admissions-official-describes-how-donald-trump-got-into-wharton-it-was-not-very-difficult/) and [bought his degree/graduation.](https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/02/trump-academics-at-wharton)
1.12.2. Con: Literacy is [defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literate#h1) as the ability to read and write. Since Trump is able to do both those things, he doesn't lack literacy.
1.12.3. Con: While trumps [speeches](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-01-13/transcript-of-trumps-speech-at-rally-before-us-capitol-riot) could be interpreted the wrong way, biden is then much [wors](https://nypost.com/article/worst-joe-biden-gaffes/)e, meaning trump would be the better option anyway.
1.13. Con: American Democracy is under much greater threat by [Democrats](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/14/18140773/new-jersey-democrats-gerrymandering-2018), [Antifa](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/02/01/berkeley-braces-for-protests-at-yiannopoulos-talk/) groups, [Leftists](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-voters-motivated-racism-may-be-violating-constitution-can-they-ncna1110356), and [other factions](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/17/elector-threats/94003176/) who have publicly undermined the American Democratic Republic.
1.13.1. Con: These disparate, ineffectual, and isolated examples do not at all outweigh the current threat to the Republic from the Right.
1.14. Con: This has become comically absurd as the real concern about democracy is, in reality, be under the Biden administration. The most unDemocratic Presidency since FDR.
1.15. Con: Due to term limits, Donald Trump cannot do irreparable damage to the democracy of the US.
1.15.1. Con: He can appoint members of the Supreme Court. While these members should not bring their political views into the court room, we all know that they do. In addition, Supreme Court Justices do not have a term limit, so they can serve for life \(on good behavior\). Because of all this, Trump can do irreparable damage to democracy in the US.
1.15.2. Con: Of course, he could be [declared President](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-china/trump-praises-chinese-president-extending-tenure-for-life-idUSKCN1GG015) \(Dictator\) [for life](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china) by [removing term limits](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/03/politics/trump-maralago-remarks/index.html), ensuring a GOP stranglehold on the Presidency. Along with other changes that could be implemented to reduce democracy.
1.15.2.1. Con: Republicans have claimed Trump's comments about China's president being made a position for life and maybe the US giving that a try someday were made in jest and have branded them a joke.
1.15.2.1.1. Con: With the 45th president's past track record, there is no conceivable way to know whether the president is telling a joke.
1.15.3. Con: A Presidential term is four years and an incumbent is limited to two terms. A lot can happen in four years, never mind eight.
1.15.3.1. Pro: World changing events can happen in four minutes \(nuclear war, signing of an executive order etc.\), never mind four years.
1.15.3.2. Pro: World War 1 lasted four years. It would be hard to argue that it did not do lasting harm to the World order. World War 2 lasted six years \(and America only participated in four of those\) and it would be impossible to say it did not have lasting impact.
1.15.4. Con: Perhaps not permanent harm, but certainly long-lasting harm that may take a generation or a life-time to repair.
1.16. Pro: Under Trump, the US House of Representatives in the past year and a half has [attempted to systematically](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/09/27/devils-triangle-wikipedia-entry-edited-by-anonymous-member-of-congress-after-kavanaugh-hearing/) [undermine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/143.231.249.133) and [disrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:143.231.249.133) Wikipedia, adding and spreading [mis-information](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=861497321&oldid=839322382).
1.16.1. Con: Trump doesn't control the legislative branch. The behavior of house staffers is the responsibility of house staffers.
1.16.2. Con: People making humorous Wikipedia edits is hardly undermining Congress or Democracy.
1.17. Pro: Trump and the Republican Congress have casually discarded many important norms in American political life in order to achieve their policy goals. The real danger is not from Trump himself, but from some future President, regardless of party, who will be able to do whatever he or she wants.
1.17.1. Con: The Trump administration has acted within the law and powers of the executive branch. Calling this undemocratic is misrepresenting the facts. Where challenged, the administration has complied with court direction: Muslim ban, family separation, DACA, etc.
1.17.1.1. Con: On June 20, 2018, the President signed an executive order ahead of an injunction to stop Zero Tolerance. In a 17-month period afterward, 1,134 families were separated under false pretenses. In this case not only following the law but his own executive order as well. [Zero Policy Continues](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/family-separation-1134-migrant-families-separated-since-end-of-trump-zero-tolerance-policy-aclu/)
1.17.1.2. Con: An example of Mr.Trump's refusal to comply with the law. Refusal to comply with all subpoenas that involve him because of "presidential executive privilege". Even interfering in subpoenas where he isn't named. This is a full accounting just for the [Impeachment Inquiry.](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-tracker/#/)
1.17.2. Pro: Trump wishes to [unilaterally](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/30/politics/donald-trump-ending-birthright-citizenship/index.html) [remove amendments](https://secondnexus.com/news/fox-fact-check-trump-citizenship-claim/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_7917df90dd5011e8871cc5c94d0ec567) to the [constitution](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/30/donald-trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-court-14th-amendment-column/1818609002/) with [executive](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order/1816666002/) [orders](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment-trump-executive-order-immigrants-constitution-a8608836.html).
1.18. Pro: Some people fear Trumps policies and rhetoric mirror and parallel historical [fascism](https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion/videos/709612966076334/?t=16), turning America fascist.
1.18.1. Pro: There is a sharp rise of the [far-right](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/books/review/jason-stanley-how-fascism-works.html) and [disturbing parallels](https://guacamoley.com/the-scoop/2018/12/05/twitter-accuses-tomi-lahren-of-taking-a-page-out-of-hitlers-playbook-after-her-latest-claims-about-the-migrant-caravan/?utm_content=inf_10_3742_2&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_c05e51d0f98a11e8871cc5c94d0ec567) to the [historic rise](http://www.dailyadvance.com/Letters/2018/07/04/062618leroylet.html) [of Fascism in](https://twitter.com/avivadautch/status/1009057553010036736?lang=en) Nazi Germany occurring in [modern America](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/anne-frank-centre-donald-trump-america-president-hitler-nazi-germany-alarming-parallels-warning-a7884731.html), [emboldened by Trump](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/5/17940610/trump-hitler-history-historian) and his rhetoric.
1.18.2. Con: Trump's term limits mean that he can never truly become a fascist leader—at least not for longer than five more years.
1.18.3. Con: Following the definition of the word, it is [not appropriate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/04/why-you-should-stop-calling-donald-trump-a-fascist/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c88d87fa6d92) to call Trump a fascist and therefore not helpful.
1.18.4. Pro: Trump and the Trump administration continue to attempt to undermine the free and independent press, spread lies and disinformation and refuse to answer or acknowledge press that asks them difficult questions or paints them in an unfavourable light, even [taking unprecedented steps](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/white-house-revokes-cnn-reporter-010642951.html) in American history to do so.
1.18.4.1. Pro: Their lies and misinformation are so brazen that they are easy to prove false and discredit.
1.18.5. Pro: America has taken the [unprecedented step](https://secondnexus.com/news/geraldo-rivera-tear-gas-fox-news/?spot_im_reply_id=sp_8fvGl692_48092_c_14tpDX_r_hqWpqT&utm_spot=sp_8fvGl692&utm_source=SpotIM&utm_medium=E-mail&utm_content=liked-message) in its history of deploying tear gas, a chemical weapon, on a civilian refugee column, firing over a border onto foreign soil to do so.
1.19. Pro: The magnitude of President Trump's [lying](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html) undermines the legitimacy of the democratic system and is embarrassing for America.
1.19.1. Con: If one is to assert that the "magnitude of lying" by a politician undermines the legitimacy of the system, then the mechanism for measuring the "magnitude of lying" and the threshold for when that undermines legitimacy would need to be defined. All politicians lie \(to varying degrees\).
1.19.2. Pro: The President's lying could set a dangerous precedent in our political system. Dishonesty is becoming more acceptable and more common in our politics.
1.19.3. Con: What counts as an embarrassment is highly subjective. A significant share of the US population is apparently not at all embarrassed by President Trump and supports him.
1.19.3.1. Con: Whole populations can be wrong about things. See: Germany and Nazism.
1.19.4. Pro: Democracy is based on informed voters, who - if they so choose - can find out what is fact and what is invention. By attempting to remove the distinction between the two, Trump makes democracy much harder to sustain.
1.19.4.1. Pro: With constant cries of "[Fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news)" and the spread of misinformation and [alternative facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts#:~:text=%22Alternative%20facts%22%20was%20a%20phrase,President%20of%20the%20United%20States.), especially by youtube, fringe groups and sites with extremely polarized ideologies, it is even harder for voters to find out what is fact and what is invention.
1.19.4.2. Pro: [Propaganda](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/propaganda) has always been a [very effective tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) at distorting reality and can make it hard to separate fact from fiction, [even for the educated and informed](https://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda).
1.19.5. Pro: [Trump had](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html), allegedly, by the [end of his Presidency,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/) made [30,573](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracity_of_statements_by_Donald_Trump) false or misleading claims in the [four year period](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/13/donald-trump-20000-false-or-misleading-claims) of his Presidency.
1.20. Pro: Under Trump, it is now possible to buy positions and awards in America. Case in point: [Miriam Adelson](https://guacamoley.com/covfefe/2018/11/12/wife-of-gop-megadonor-makes-trumps-list-of-presidential-medal-of-freedom-recipients-%F0%9F%91%80/?utm_content=inf_10_3742_2&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_25f79d10e6af11e8871cc5c94d0ec567), who is getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, simply for being a GOP super-doner who has given the GOP more than $100,000,000.
1.20.1. Con: Pay to play existed long before Trump; this isn't unique to him and his presidency.
1.20.2. Pro: More recently, [Kelly Knight Craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Knight_Craft) has been nominated to be our next UN Ambassador. She and her husband donated more than $2 million to the Trump campaign.
1.20.3. Con: She also received the W[oodrow Wilson Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Adelson) for corporate citizenship and is an honorary citizen of Israel. Neither of which she paid for.
1.20.4. Con: Trump never had a foundation set up to receive payments for pay-to-play like the Clintons, nor did anyone of his family receive financial benefit for the sole purpose of access to him as president like Biden did with his son and China.
