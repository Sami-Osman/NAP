1. Which political leaning serves our [inalienable rights](https://www.kialo.com/what-are-the-inalienable-rights-49985) best?
1.1. A liberal approach, \(meaning more government,\) is the best way to actualize our inalienable rights.
1.1.1. Con: Big government tends to involve redistributive taxation, which violates wealthy people's inalienable right to private property.
1.1.1.1. Con: Equality is also an inalienable right, and without redistributive taxation, inequalities are entrenched further.
1.1.2. Pro: Human or Civil Rights is best served with a liberal approach
1.1.2.1. Pro: The liberal implementation of civil rights serves the interest of the most people.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The American Democratic party supports equal gender and sexuality rights, expanding the rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness to LGBTQIA+ minorities that previously could not express themselves or marry their partners.
1.1.2.2. Con: A centrist view that civil rights are really just an extension of liberty is sufficient. Otherwise we end up using the arms of the government to attack docile majorities.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Majorities, simply by being in power and universally wanting better outcomes for their own interests will naturally trespass upon minorities. Thus, no majority is docile because power is always in motion.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The left side of the aisle has fought for and claimed most of the civil, political, social and human rights we cherish today.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Civil rights are the product of the idea that society is made up of free individuals with inalienable rights that even an elected government cannot withdraw from them.
1.1.2.5. Con: Authoritarian left are equally likely to hurt human rights and civil rights as the authoritarian right. Authoritarianism is much more of an indicator of bad policy than left/right

1.1.3.1. Pro: The need for medical care often arises unpredictably and at vast personal expense. Having a publicly funded healthcare system is a reliable safety net for people, especially the poor.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The UK's national healthcare system \(NHS\) provides free at the point of delivery access to life-saving medical care, and at a fraction of the cost, compared to the [US's private insurance model](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/02/17/comparative-twin-study-access-to-healthcare-services-in-the-nhs-and-the-american-private-insurance-system/).
1.2. A conservative approach, \(meaning the least amount of government,\) best serves our inalienable rights
1.2.1. Con: Lessening the rights of a government opens the door for private individuals to exploit others and violate their inalienable rights.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Without governmental rules that protect inalienable rights, individuals with power over others, like landlords or bosses, can violate the rights of others.
1.2.1.2. Con: A conservative approach and a small amount of government would mean a clear focus on the core functions of the state, which include maintaining security, law and order.
1.2.1.3. Con: Because government is made up of private individuals, powerful people can easily exploit others through government as well.
1.2.2. Pro: A conservative amount of governing should be applied to [a person's free expression](https://www.kialo.com/the-ability-to-express-ones-self-as-they-see-fit-is-an-inalienable-right-49985.188?path=49985.0~49985.188)

1.2.3.1. Con: A lack of government regulation on building might lead to dangerous or uninhabitable homes being built.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Under a conservative system in which the government abstained from as much involvement as possible, A person could exercise their free will to move to any place they saw fit, and use what resources, easiest to come by. This would allow the maximum amount of desired homes to be built.
1.2.4. Pro: [The right to defend one's self or property](https://www.kialo.com/the-right-to-self-defense-49985.118?path=49985.0~49985.118) would be best served with minimal governmental interactions, thus a conservative approach.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Under a minimal government, individuals are encouraged and empowered to protect their own property, as they know that they may not be able to rely on government aid.
1.2.4.2. Con: The right to defend one's self or property should be balanced with the right to life. Given that this is best served with liberal amounts of oversight, the same approach must be applied to the right to defend.
1.2.5. Pro: [The right to liberty, also defined as, "freedom from,"](https://www.kialo.com/the-right-to-liberty-also-defined-as-freedom-from-is-inalienable-49985.7?path=49985.0~49985.7) requires a conservative presence from governing bodies.
1.2.5.1. Pro: No government can bestow inalienable rights, as [we are born with them](https://share.america.gov/what-does-it-mean-for-right-to-be-inalienable/)(The idea of an inalienable right is at the heart of U.S. democracy â€” a right that people are born with and that can never be taken away.).

1.2.5.1.1. Con: While governments cannot theoretically grant or revoke inalienable rights, they can simply ignore them if it serves their interests.
1.2.5.2. Pro: By a diminished governmental presence, people can employ their energy to pursue whatever end goal they want.

1.3.1. Pro: [Settling disputes](https://www.kialo.com/the-right-to-settle-disputes-fairly-would-be-altogether-necessary-49985.165?path=49985.0~49985.165) would require rules, but not too many, and therefore a centered and balanced amount of governing
1.3.2. Pro: No leaning of any type should be present when [applying any law to any individual.](https://www.kialo.com/equal-protection-under-law-is-an-inalienable-right-49985.140?path=49985.0~49985.140)
1.3.2.1. Pro: Keeping laws simple and general allow for humans to have interactions that when scrutinized in a court of law would allow judges best to determine the value of each parties claims.
1.3.2.2. Pro: People from all nations and all time periods have shown time and time again that with a liberal application of legal force, people generally devolve into tribalism.
1.3.3. Pro: [The pursuit of happiness, \(PoH,\) also defined as, "freedom to"](https://www.kialo.com/the-pursuit-of-happiness-poh-also-defined-as-freedom-to-is-inalienable-49985.9?path=49985.0~49985.9) is challenged by any political leaning and therefore requires a centrist approach to governmental application.
1.3.3.1. Con: Not all citizens have the same resources and supports naturally available to them. A liberal approach to liberty is more appropriate as it supports those who would otherwise be oppressed by the circumstances of their own birth.
1.3.4. Pro: [Welfare](https://www.kialo.com/welfare-or-government-assistance-is-an-inalienable-right-49985.136?path=49985.0~49985.136) is best served by a centrist point of view.
1.3.4.1. Con: A conservative approach would present enough of a challenge to deter incentivized laziness.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Incentivized laziness is not the state of a significant margin of the population, and thus can be deterred without affecting the rest of the working class.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Centrists usually bring elements from different political movements together and thus create stability.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: The "[crisis of centrism](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/18/crisis-in-liberalism-katrina-forrester)" and the emergence of more extreme political movements in various countries in recent years suggest that this stability can be disrupted fairly easily.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Cohesive center-right parties can facilitate political stability and compromises because of the [organizational robustness of center-right partisan institutions](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-polisci-090717-092750).
1.3.4.3. Con: A socialized view of welfare sees public institutions as being responsible for addressing poverty. This would require a liberal amount of government to ensure success.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Taking into account that it would be immoral to leave the destitute to waste away, It would also be immoral to unduly burden the successful
