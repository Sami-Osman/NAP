1.1. Pro: TV has a negative impact on health.
1.1.1. Con: People can come together and form positive communities around their favorite television shows, [improving mental health](https://www.headtohealth.gov.au/meaningful-life/connectedness/community)(Being part of a community can have a positive effect on mental health and emotional wellbeing. Community involvement provides a sense of belonging and social connectedness. It can also offer extra meaning and purpose to everyday life.\n\nCommunities can exist or be created from a shared location, hobbies, lived experiences and backgrounds, or a common cause. For many people, communicating with others – through online forums, social media, or in person – can help them to have a healthier mindset, improved self-worth, and greater enjoyment of life.).
1.1.1.1. Pro: The fan community around Star Trek has been described as [good-willed and dizzyingly diverse](https://www.gq.com/story/this-is-how-star-trek-invented-fandom)(This is what Star Trek fandom looks like a half century out: dizzyingly diverse, good-willed, extraordinarily \(if inadvertently\) influential, equal parts goofy and moving. But conventions, like weddings, are expensive and labor-intensive events that paradoxically celebrate something freely and effortlessly given—affection.), creating an undeniably positive environment.
1.1.1.2. Con: Some TV show communities can be toxic, [engaging in bullying and other antisocial behavior](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-toxic-fandom-5214499)(These behaviors can range from impassioned negative responses to a reboot of a particular pop-culture property to bullying other members of a fandom or those involved with the creation of a movie, TV show, video game, song, or book, to antisocial behaviors such as making death threats, rape threats, or doxing \(publishing a person's private information\).\n\nMost toxic fandom activities take place via online community websites or social media, especially Twitter, although they can also be seen in other places, such as fan events and conventions.).
1.1.1.2.1.

1.1.1.3. Pro: The Doctor Who TV series has cultivated a [large and loyal fanbase](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/doctor-who-fan-base-evolved-because-of-the-internet.html/)(Doctor Who is an interesting fan base to look at since it’s been around for so long. Doctor Who fans have always been involved and enthusiastic about the source material. Even when the show wasn’t on, from 1989-2005, fans kept the love for the show going by creating everything from clothing to comics. This hasn’t stopped with the introduction of the Internet. \n\nIf anything, fans have only gotten more creative, writing fanfiction and drawing fanart. Fans can also run entire Twitter or Instagram accounts dedicated to the show. These accounts can include fan edits, discussion of the show with other fans, polls, and more. Doctor Who fans are definitely creative, yet such creativity isn’t the only thing that stands out.), which has lead to the development of multiple [fan projects](http://www.thedoctorwhoproject.com/)(The Doctor Who Project \(TDWP\) is the multiple award winning Canadian Doctor Who fiction series based on the long-running BBC science-fiction television series “Doctor Who”. TDWP centers on the continuing adventures of an alternate Doctor and his companions.

1.1.1.4. Pro: [Fan theory culture peaked](https://mashable.com/article/game-of-thrones-fan-theory-culture)(Thrones is far from the first piece of media to generate a massive fan theory culture — Lost thrived on torturing its audience with cryptic clues and red herrings, and people wrote actual books on what would happen next in the Harry Potter series. Thrones does, however, have the distinction of legitimizing fan theories as a crucial and expected part of each episode’s aftermath.\n\nWhile some people watch Game of Thrones and take the plot at face value, the effort to predict the show’s next big twist have become a cottage industry unto itself. During and after each episode, Twitter and Reddit light up with posts from superfans who claim to hold the key to the endgame based on line readings and newly revealed information, and online outlets \(including Mashable\) publish exhaustive analyses that not only sum up what just happened on Game of Thrones, but what might happen next.) with Game of Thrones; thousands of analytical articles were written and millions of fans flooded online communities with speculation about what would happen next.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The obsession over Game of Thrones likely led to a decrease in productivity and social interaction as fans [spent too much time](https://yukaichou.com/gamification-study/gamification-game-thrones-addicting/)(As the main advocates and early adopters of this show, they have helped to propel Game of Thrones to a sort of “tipping point” where you can’t go two steps anymore in public without seeing someone watching or reading Game of Thrones.\n\nOther similar examples where this has happened before include DaVinci Code, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, and Lord of the Rings.\n\nWhile in my mind there is no denying how well written and executed Game of Thrones is; in reality, to most of us, it takes a large network effect for us to see what’s going on primarily due to the Core drive of Social Pressure & Envy.\n\nAs more and more people watch and debate about the show, we naturally want to be a part of the action and feel included in these conversations. \(aka Bandwagoning\)\n\nGame of Thrones also became referenced in many other cultural mediums, making everyone feel that they “should” know what is going on in Game of Thrones.) pouring over articles and expounding upon theories.
1.1.1.5. Con: If people were to spend [less time](https://www.statista.com/statistics/186833/average-television-use-per-person-in-the-us-since-2002/)(Estimates suggest that in 2022 U.S. adults will spend an average of around three hours watching TV each day.) watching TV, they would have more free time to pursue more constructive hobbies, or to play sports.
1.1.2. Pro: TV causes physical health problems.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Prolonged prediagnostic TV watching [is associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610734/) with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality independent of leisure-time physical activity among colorectal cancer patients.
1.1.2.2. Pro: [A study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/04/tv-a-sleep-detriment-in-children-study-finds/) found a small but consistent association between increased television viewing and shorter sleep duration.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Lack of sleep can increase the [risk of high blood pressure, diabetes and heart issues](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/happens-body-dont-get-enough-sleep/)(If you continue operating without enough sleep, you may see more long-term and serious health problems. Some of the most serious potential problems associated with chronic sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Other potential problems include obesity, depression, reduced immune system function and lower sex drive.).
1.1.2.3. Con: TV can encourage [sedentary behavior](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/television-and-sedentary-behavior-and-obesity/), which can lead to [health issues](https://www.fertilityshow.co.uk/our-blog/detail/does-watching-too-much-tv-make-men-less-fertile)(The results, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, showed that watching more than five hours of TV a day can cut a man’s sperm count by a third \(37 million sperm per millilitre of fluid, compared to 52 million per millilitre among men who hardly ever watched TV\). The report authors suggest that the results may be because those who watch too much TV are less likely to exercise regularly or maintain a healthy diet.).
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Watching excessive amounts of TV can [lower sperm count](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50703174/ns/health-mens_health/t/put-down-remote-tv-can-lower-sperm-count/#.WtZ9poiuyUk)(The researchers examined the semen quality of 189 college men between the ages of 18 to 22 who participated in the Rochester Young Men’s Study during 2009 and 2010 at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. The men were quizzed about their exercise and TV propensities plus their diets, their stress levels and whether they smoked – all of which can impact sperm quality.\n\nTwenty five percent of the 189 men reported logging more than 20 hours per week of TV time, Chavarro said. Their sperm counts were 44 percent lower than those of the men who watched little television, the researchers report in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The men who reported exercising 14 hours a week or more – enough to get out of breath – had the highest sperm counts.\n\nA normal sperm count, according to the World Health Organization, is 53 sperm per milliliter of semen, and when a man has below 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen, that’s considered abnormal.).
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: For men that do not desire to have children, a lower sperm count is not a relevant concern.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Reading books is also a sedentary activity, but not labeled as being a negative activity. As such, TV should be considered an adjacent category.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Reading books has proven to have [positive effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books#increases-empathy)(What exactly do human beings get from reading books? Is it just a matter of pleasure, or are there benefits beyond enjoyment? The scientific answer is a resounding “yes.”\n\nReading books benefits both your physical and mental health, and those benefits can last a lifetime.

Reading is critical during these early years, as your children will quickly begin to learn new words and new concepts that will help carry them through the rest of their lives, and even set them ahead of the learning curve.), brain function, and overall health, whereas watching TV has notable [negative lifestyle effects](https://hhma.org/healthadvisor/pa-btelevis-hhg/)(TV discourages reading.\n\nReading requires much more thinking than television. Reading improves a child’s vocabulary. A decrease in reading scores may be related to too much time in front of the TV.\n\nTV displaces active types of recreation.\n\nIt decreases time spent playing with peers. A child has less time for self-directed daydreaming and thinking. It takes away time for participating in sports, music, art, or other activities that require practice to achieve competence.).

The aim is to prevent the disease and disability caused by unhealthy and sedentary living.\n\nSedentary lifestyles increase all causes of mortality, double the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity, and increase the risks of colon cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, depression and anxiety. According to WHO, 60 to 85% of people in the world—from both developed and developing countries—lead sedentary lifestyles, making it one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time.).
1.1.2.3.5. Con: TV viewers do not need to be seated while watching TV. They can [perform exercises](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-to-burn-300-calories-while-you-watch-tv-3495599)(Watching TV is a favorite pastime for many and is a relaxing way to wind down after a long day.

Pro: In order for TV use to be deemed [excessive](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-05-06/too-much-tv-coronavirus)(Doctors and researchers have come up with slightly different answers, but the general rule is that anything more than 3½ hours of television each day can be excessive.\n\n“There was no association with adverse effects for watching up to 3½ hours a day,” said Daisy Fancourt, an associate professor of psychology and epidemiology at University College London who co-wrote a 2019 study that associated excessive TV watching among older adults with increased memory loss. “But \[any time\] beyond that was associated with cognitive decline.”), one must watch more than 3.5 hours of TV per day. It is likely that many people watch less than this.
1.1.2.6. Con: Compared to other addictions, like cigarettes or alcohol, watching television is not as harmful.
1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Smoking directly causes a number of ailments such as [cancer, diabetes, heart disease and bronchitis, as well as increasing the risk of a number of diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/health_effects/index.htm)(Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(COPD\), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

1.1.4. Pro: TV has harmful psychological effects.
1.1.4.1. Con: People who watch [excessive](https://medium.com/\@RaajasSode/why-digital-escapism-might-be-worse-than-social-media-addiction-c9d2c6992384) amounts of TV are primarily using it as a form of [escapism](http://affinitymagazine.us/2017/01/21/modern-escapism-binge-watching-netflix-to-avoid-life/)(It finally hit me one day during my AP English class, while everyone was handing in an in-class essay that they had been preparing for weeks, that I spent my study time binge-watching Scandal and House of Cards on Netflix. The reason why I was making such an idiotic choice that was impacting my studies and grades so negatively? Escapism.\n\nWhen trying to understand myself and after multiple google searches, I had found a research paper by Bernd Henning and Peter Vorderer, that stated “Kubey notes that the research literature “has made it clear that television is an activity likely to be chosen by people wishing to escape from negative feelings and from the demands of reality.””\n\nIt finally all made sense in my head.

1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: [Researchers](http://www.circuitinsight.com/programs/49747.html)(It remains an open question, say the researchers, whether social surrogacy suppresses belongingness needs or actually fulfills them, and they acknowledge that the kind of social surrogacy provoked by these programs can be a poor substitution for "real" human-to-human experience.) say that the social surrogacy provided by TV programs is a poor substitution for human-to-human experience.
1.1.4.2. Pro: TV promotes drug use and abuse.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Movies & shows glorifying substance abuse lifestyle like [Narcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos), [Breaking Bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad) and [The Wolf of Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street_\(2013_film\)) are widely known, while there is little attention for the actual damages of the opioid crisis and the drug trade.

The show documents police responses to illegal activities, often showing the consequences of drug use or drug-related offenses. These include disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and public intoxication. Indeed, four of the top 10 shows with drug mentions were crime dramas \(Bones, CSI, Law & Order: SVU, and Law & Order\), and one – ER – was a medical drama that often depicts the injuries and negative aftereffects of drug abuse.) drug use in a negative light.

1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: People who [struggle with loneliness and depression](http://time.com/3689264/lonely-depressed-binge-watching/) are more likely to binge-watch television than their peers. This activity provides an escape from their unpleasant feelings.
1.1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Binge-watching [provides viewers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/depression-loneliness-linked-to-binge-watching-television/)(But the researchers also point out that ironically the habit serves as a means to bond with peers. "Binge-watching allows viewers to join in on conversations about a program with friends. Doing so may give them a sense of belonging to a community," the researchers write in their study.) with a sense of community by bonding with others over a shared interest in the same TV shows.

Con: [Weekly or monthly release schedules](https://www.nexttv.com/news/why-the-peak-tv-glut-gives-advantage-to-weekly-releases)(Weekly releases, on the other hand, carry no such stressors. They’re scheduled at a specific day and time that you can build your schedule around. \(Hence the popularity of regularly scheduled exercise classes, to revert to the previous metaphor.\) If you miss a day, or two or even an entire week, it’s easy enough to catch up by doubling up on episodes, which is nowhere near as stressful as trying to figure out when you will find time for the six hour-long episodes of that binge-able series you still need to watch.) would prolong this sense of community by encouraging people to [engage with the show for longer](https://whatsondisneyplus.com/binge-watch-vs-weekly-releases-whats-working/)(Based on this data, the majority of shows that release weekly, have generally spent longer in the top 20 list than the binge-dropped shows. With a binge drop, it’s much easier for fans to consume the entire series in a few days, whereas, with a weekly release, the show can keep most viewers engaged for weeks, sometimes months. Out of the top ten shows, eight are released weekly and just two were released in a binge format.).
1.1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: Addiction born out of escapism can lead to a [decline in self compassion](https://www.fortbehavioral.com/addiction-recovery-blog/escapism-coping-skill-or-detrimental/#)(Addiction born out of escapism can lead to a decline in self-compassion, as people with self-compassion are more willing to accept responsibility for negative life events.), which is harmful to the addict's life.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: People with low levels of self-control were more likely to binge-watch, which would directly classify the practice as a [harmful addiction](http://time.com/3689264/lonely-depressed-binge-watching/)(The researchers said that binge-watching should no longer be seen as a “harmless addiction” and pointed out that the activity is related to obesity, fatigue and other health concerns.).
1.1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Netflix, which is largely credited for having [invented binge-watching](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-netflix-invented-binge-watching-2016-6?r=US&IR=T)(Netflix saw this as an “inefficiency” in the market, Hastings told the Times. No one was wringing rerun value out of those shows, and Netflix’s format was perfect for it. With Netflix, you could watch two or three episodes at once, on-demand, and then pick up where you left off in the narrative the next time. People loved watching shows that way, and it lead to the cultural force we now call “binge-watching.”\n\nAt the time, networks saw this as a win-win, since the binge-watching also boosted interest for the current season of the show, sometimes even catapulting it into the national pop culture conversation. Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, told the Times that “‘Breaking Bad’ was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.”\n\nBut though Netflix had pioneered the binge, the company knew its relationship with networks wouldn’t stay the same forever.), pushes shows onto people without self-control without their explicit consent by automatically playing the next episode of a TV show.
1.1.4.5. Con: Only if people take it seriously enough to conflate its inherently-mediated \(ie, [vicarious\)](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/vicarious#Adjective) experiences with their own unmediated \(ie, direct\) personal ones.
1.1.5. Con: Watching sporting events or art shows might encourage people to pursue these activities, ultimately bettering their health.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Bob Ross, a popular TV painter, encouraged [everyone](https://www.muddycolors.com/2021/09/12-reasons-why-bob-ross-is-a-better-artist-than-you-are/)(Many people who don’t know how to draw or paint like to simply chalk their ignorance up to “A lack of God-given talent”.

1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Expressing oneself through art can help [relieve stress and improve cognitive abilities](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-healing-power-of-art)(Studies have shown that expressing themselves through art can help people with depression, anxiety, or cancer, too. And doing so has been linked to improved memory, reasoning, and resilience in healthy older people.).
1.1.5.2. Pro: Major televised sporting events increase the number of people [signing up to play sports](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/psychology-of-watching-sport-for-fitness_uk_60f82c88e4b0e92dfebebe35)(A funny thing happens after a big sporting event takes over our televisions: fitness centres, gyms and sports clubs see a spike in new members.\n\nIt happened after the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup, when 850,000 more women signed up to play footie. Then again during and immediately after Wimbledon the same year, when the Lawn Tennis Association saw casual player court bookings jump by around 49%.).
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Watching run-of-the-mill daily sporting matches on television is [not correlated](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-10)(In conclusion, we found no association between watching sport on TV and physical activity levels in a representative sample of older adults. These data question using health legacy pledges as a vehicle to justify staging major sporting events.) with an increase in physical activity, suggesting that people who watch sport are not physically active.
1.1.5.3. Con: People who are very interested in sports will likely pursue the sport both in person and on TV, making the overall amount of time they watch TV unlikely to go down.
1.1.6. Con: People who stayed at home watching TV during the pandemic [kept themselves safe](https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/stories/rethinking-screen-time-time-covid-19)(As the COVID-19 pandemic shows, we are increasingly reliant on digital technology. It has become a lifeline for those of us confined to our homes.\n\nNow is a good time to revisit assumptions linked to children’s use of these devices, which often stem from fear of the unknown. To counter these fears, parents might use the extra time they spend together with their children while in lockdown to learn more about each other’s worlds, both digital and physical.) and improved their relationships with their families.
1.2. Con: TV is a valuable and accessible source of entertainment.
1.2.1. Pro: TV allows people to watch films they may have missed or would be unable to afford to see at the cinema.
1.2.1.1. Pro: For people of a lower economic status, watching television is the only way they can enjoy the same movies as those who can afford to see them. Thus, TV is a social good.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The price of cinema tickets [vary from country to country](https://www.netcredit.com/blog/price-to-watch-movie-every-country/)(In some places, ticket prices are rising to fuel the recovery, while others are dropping prices to tempt back movie-goers in greater numbers.

Pro: [Theater promotions and cinema subscription services](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/movie-tickets-summer-box-office)(The decrease in ticket prices can be attributed to a number of factors, including theater promotions, discounts, and theatrical subscription services like AMC Stubs A-List.) can drive down the price of cinema tickets, making them even more affordable.
1.2.1.2. Con: Most films are only available on TV or streaming [long after](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/28/media/movies-streaming-box-office-theaters/index.html)(According to Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore \(SCOR\), that 30- to 45-day timeframe gives blockbusters enough time to make money in theaters while maintaining momentum for fans who are holding out for streaming.\n"45 days, give or take, is the perfect theatrical window for the modern era," Dergarabedian said. "It gives enough time for a movie to play in theaters, build prestige and exclusivity, while at the same time \[it\] gives consumers the knowledge that they're going to have the opportunity to watch the movie on the small screen within a reasonable amount of time.") they are released in cinema.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: New blockbuster movies are increasingly seeing early [streaming releases](https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/best-new-movies-to-stream-this-week/).
1.2.1.3. Pro: The diverse offering of shows available on TV and [streaming services](https://www.cloudwards.net/streaming-services-statistics/)(A staggering 85% of U.S. households have at least one video streaming subscription, and 60% have at least one paid music streaming subscription.) allows people to access a variety of content they wouldn't have access to otherwise.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Streaming services tend to have dynamic and restrictive catalogues. Netflix [has around](http://time.com/4272360/the-number-of-movies-on-netflix-is-dropping-fast/) 6,000 shows and movies, while IMDB is approaching [five million](https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/stats/) entries, meaning that only 0.12% of movies IMDB has indexed are available on Netflix.
1.2.2. Pro: TV is an outlet for the arts and creative human expression.
1.2.2.1. Pro: TV might be the only exposure to the arts for many people, assuming they do not read books or visit museums.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: There are [122 million homes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/243789/number-of-tv-households-in-the-us/)(According to estimates, there are 122.4 million TV homes in the United States for the 2021-2022 TV season.) in the US with a TV. Having a means of consuming art in their home makes it far more accessible.
1.2.2.2. Pro: TV series can explore deep and significant philosophical and artistic themes.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: The critically-acclaimed TV anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, explores themes of [individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_of_Neon_Genesis_Evangelion#Philosophy). Such heavy and complex themes are common in other art forms.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Black Mirror uses TV as a medium to [critique technology and modern society](https://stacker.com/stories/13698/15-great-philosophical-tv-shows)(Through a series of stand-alone stories, this anthology show takes a contemporary spin on “The Twilight Zone” formula, depicting various human fears about the modern world and the future intertwined with the consequences of technology.). This is a common theme in more [traditional forms of art](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739149232/The-Art-of-Social-Critique-Painting-Mirrors-of-Social-Life).
1.2.2.2.3. Con: The majority of world's [most popular TV shows](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls095964455/) do not explore significant philosophical or artistic themes.
1.2.2.3. Con: TV is only an outlet for the creative expression of a small number of writers, directors and producers. TV viewers are merely consumers.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: [Public-access TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-access_television) allows the average citizen to create and air their own creative works.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Getting a screenplay to air is extremely difficult. The writers guild of America has only [20,000 members](https://freshmenscreenplay.com/how-many-screenplays-are-written-and-sold-each-year/), and of them, fewer than [5,000 writers](https://freshmenscreenplay.com/how-many-screenplays-are-written-and-sold-each-year/)(WGA determined that 4,760 of its members earned money from screenplays in 2016.) earned money from their screenplays in 2016.
1.2.2.4. Con: Theater, school plays, and other live arts are also outlets for creative expression.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Live arts are restrictive and unavailable most of the time. TV programming is always available, day and night.
1.2.3. Con: Impoverished people who cannot afford to pay for cable television are left with just the local channels and few options for entertainment.
1.2.3.1. Con: [TV piracy](https://torrentfreak.com/tv-piracy-is-growing-rapidly-in-the-uk-data-show/) is accessible, on the rise and unlikely to lead to any severe consequences. If someone cannot afford TV, then they can easily pirate it.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: In poorer regions, one cable subscriber can [share their access](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/whattheworldspoorwatchontv)(One reason it is difficult to establish the precise number of people with access to a set in the poor world-as James Murdoch, chief executive of Star TV Group and son of Rupert, told a cable conference in India-is that individual cable subscribers sometimes pass on the service illegally to an entire neighbourhood.) with entire neighborhoods.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Suggesting theft of intellectual property is hardly a reasonable solution for expensive cable.
1.2.3.2. Pro: People can only watch one TV channel at a time. While people without cable have less choice, they are still able to access quality programming.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: [Picture-in-Picture](https://techparasol.com/smart-tvs-picture-in-picture/)(The picture-in-picture feature on Smart TVs allow you to watch a TV programme from one source and simultaneously watch a programme from another source in a small inset window in the corner of the screen.) allows people to watch multiple channels at once.
1.2.4. Con: TV is only accessible and affordable to those in developed countries.
1.2.4.1. Pro: TV requires that a household have consistent and cheap power, as TVs consume a lot of [electricity](https://www.idealhome.co.uk/property-advice/how-much-electricity-does-a-tv-use-299917)(TVs are rated for energy efficiency on a scale of A-G, but since the scale was revised in March 2021, most will have an E-G rating. For an idea of energy usage, look at the kWh/1000h number on the label to work out how much it’ll cost to run over an average year \(1,000 hours is around 2-3 hours per day or about 19 hours a week\).).
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Many developing countries have [load-shedding](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/load-shedding) or [power outages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014098832030222X)(In developing countries, access to electricity has received much attention. However, the reliability of its supply has been given less focus, though power outages happen frequently and are expected to limit gains from electricity connection.), which would interrupt people's TV viewing to the point where it would be useless.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: TVs can be run using [external generators](https://www.homesteadinhawaii.com/home/can-a-generator-run-a-tv/)(Is It Safe To Run A TV With A Generator? Yes, it's safe to run a TV with a generator as long as the generator does double-duty as an inverter.), which are not reliant on national power grids.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Electricity rates in some developing countries are capped, meaning they have less of an impact on the operational costs of owning a TV \([p. 4](https://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/WorldEnergyCouncil_Pricing_Energy_in.pdf)(Especially in developing countries, achieving it depends on policies specifically targeted to meet the needs of the poor. The best way for governments to ensure that a growing number of people will be able to afford commercial energy in line with their needs is to pursue policies which accelerate economic growth, trade with neighbouring markets, and a more equitable income distribution. This requires increasing reliance on the market, while addressing cases of market failure with special policies. An energy tariff reflecting all costs, including external costs such as emissions and waste management, is necessary to secure adequate investment and to encourage energy efficiency and environmentally preferred technologies. However, such a tariff would be unaffordable for many people in developing countries. There may therefore be a need, in some cases, to subsidise energy technology and delivery for a period of time, without creating price distortions or at least keeping them to a minimum.)\).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Cable can be costly, especially in developing countries like the Philippines. Cable plans can cost [US$35](https://www.easyexpat.com/en/guides/philippines/manila/moving/tv-internet.htm)(Cable TV is a subscription service with different plans available. Prices range from PHP 500 per month for basic plans to PHP 2000 per month for premium plans.) per month, yet the minimum wage is as low as [US$7.50 per day](https://wageindicator.org/salary/minimum-wage/minimum-wages-news/2022/minimum-wage-increased-in-the-philippines-from-04-june-2022-may-30-2022)(The minimum wages have been revised for 2 regions of the Philippines with effect from 04 June 2022.

1.2.4.3. Con: Many people in the global south and developing nations worldwide [have access to TV sets](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/whattheworldspoorwatchontv)(Daya Thussu, in Electronic Empires, estimated that 2.5 billion people have regular access to a television in the south \(the developing world\)-meaning about half the people that live there-which explains why the western-based media empires have turned their attention to it. China, with a population of 1.3 billion and one of the world’s fastest growing economies, is clearly a prize market for such corporations. By 1999, China had an estimated 350m sets-meaning almost all households had access to television in one way or another...).
1.2.5. Pro: Although television is not inherently bad, many viewers choose to consume [poor quality programming](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/21/nearly-a-third-of-tv-viewers-think-programme-quality-is-getting-worse).
1.2.5.1. Pro: A television is merely a device. Educating users in responsible usage would be more beneficial than blaming the device.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: People must be taught [self-discipline](https://www.adventisthealthcare.com/living-well/the-importance-of-self-discipline/) in order to refrain from watching content that could have a negative impact on their health.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: People frequently engage in activities that are [bad for their health](https://www.parrishhealthcare.com/news/2019/november/top-bad-health-habits-that-increase-risk-of-dise/)(While it’s okay to indulge in a sweet treat every now and then, or to skip the gym for a day, getting into a health rut can have a detrimental impact on your overall health. Not to mention, it can also increase your risk of cancer or heart disease. Participating in the following five unhealthy habits can keep you from living your best healthy life.\n\n1. Lack of Vegetables in Your Diet\n\n2. Eating On-The-Go\n\n3. Living a Sedentary Lifestyle\n\n4. Forgoing Doctor Recommended Cancer Screenings\n\n5. Not Getting Enough Sleep).
1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: [TV shows are addicting](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-happens-your-brain-when-you-binge-watch-tv-series-ncna816991)("When engaged in an activity that's enjoyable such as binge watching, your brain produces dopamine," she explains. "This chemical gives the body a natural, internal reward of pleasure that reinforces continued engagement in that activity. It is the brain's signal that communicates to the body, 'This feels good. You should keep doing this!' When binge watching your favorite show, your brain is continually producing dopamine, and your body experiences a drug-like high. You experience a pseudo-addiction to the show because you develop cravings for dopamine."\n\nAccording to Dr. Carr, the process we experience while binge watching is the same one that occurs when a drug or other type of addiction begins. "The neuronal pathways that cause heroin and sex addictions are the same as an addiction to binge watching," Carr explains. "Your body does not discriminate against pleasure. It can become addicted to any activity or substance that consistently produces dopamine."); many people may not be able to control themselves in watching programming that has a negative impact on their health.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: How people choose to use the device dictates the effect it has, TVs are not inherently bad.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: TV is designed to encourage unhealthy usage.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: TV streaming services encourage binge-watching by [automatically playing](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2019/april/binge-watching.html)("Subscription platforms promote binge-watching because it keeps the customer in front of the screen," Ferreira said. "When one episode ends, the next one automatically starts. Also, the way these stories are written makes them better consumed in this manner. The storytellers take into account that you're not going to watch one episode per week, you're going to watch several back-to-back.") the next episode of a series.
1.2.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: Modern TV shows are getting [increasingly longer run times](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/tv-show-episodes-are-too-long-stranger-things-episode-length/)(But instead of shorter runtimes to court viewers into investing in new series, the consequences of so much TV being available—old and new—has sent us to the opposite end of the spectrum. The episode counts are short, but the episodes themselves are unbearably long.). If binge watched, three episodes of a program could take up three hours of a person's time.
1.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: By releasing every episode of a series at once, streaming services encourage viewers to watch an [entire series](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2019/april/binge-watching.html)(Take the example of Netflix's "Russian Doll." The first season is comprised of eight episodes totaling four hours of content. If "Russian Doll" was distributed according to a traditional model, where one 30-minute episode was released each week, a viewer would have to subscribe for two months to watch the first season from start to finish. But with a subscription video on demand service, that same viewer can binge the entire show over the course of an evening.) in one sitting.
1.2.5.1.3.3. Pro: Twenty-four-hour news channels must compete for viewership by [sensationalizing](https://lagunatreatment.com/co-occurring-disorder/news-media-and-addiction/)(As 24-hour news outlets compete for viewers, they often cover events in extreme detail or may even sensationalize aspects of the story to make the coverage more appealing.

1.2.5.1.3.4. Con: TV is not designed to encourage anything other than the ability for someone to watch shows and movies on it.
1.2.5.1.3.5. Con: Couches and recliners are designed for unhealthy sedentary behaviors; TV itself is not.
1.2.5.2. Con: Most people are exposed to advertisements regardless of the show quality; these are often manipulative and harmful.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: The stereotypes used in adverts display gender discrimination.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The UK [banned](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/style/uk-gender-stereotype-ads-ban.html) gender stereotyping in adverts in 2019.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: Women are less likely to be given [speaking roles](http://socialpsychonline.com/2015/08/culture-gender-stereotyping-advertising/) in advertisements, and are rarely shown in positions of authority \([p. 5](https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2636&context=jiws)(Further, women are also depicted as submissive to men and may even face aggressive verbal or physical behavior in the advertisements.

1.2.5.2.1.3. Pro: Women are more likely to be portrayed in a [domestic environment](http://socialpsychonline.com/2015/08/culture-gender-stereotyping-advertising/) in advertisements.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: [Alcohol](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35282458.pdf)(Viewing alcohol advertisements \(but not alcohol portrayals\) may increase immediate alcohol consumption by small amounts, equivalent to between 0.39 and 2.67 alcohol units for males and between 0.25 and 1.69 units for females.) and tobacco advertisements have a negative effect on public health as they promote consumption of these hazardous products.
1.2.5.2.2.1.

Therefore, two between-subjects experimental studies explore the potential for allowing the marketing of SLT as a “reduced-risk” alternative to cigarette smoking. Specifically, this article addresses the issue of whether a harm reduction message with the simultaneous presence of the U.S. government-mandated warning would: \(1\) change intentions of smokers to use SLT products; or \(2\) attract those who would not otherwise use any tobacco. Results suggest that an advertiser making a harm reduction statement in the presence of the warning leads to limited changes in consumers' risk perceptions of SLT products or intentions to try the product. Exposure to the experimental ads did not make nonsmokers significantly more likely to try SLT products, but also did not make smokers indicate that they were likely to switch to SLT products.) advertisements are used to downplay the risk of tobacco products.
1.2.5.2.2.2. Con: Some countries, such as Ireland, have strict laws [prohibiting tobacco companies from advertising](https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/country/ireland/aps-regulated-forms) on television in order to prevent the negative public health effects of such advertisements.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: Some TVs and DVRs have the option to [block, filter, or skip](https://techpenny.com/how-to-block-ads-on-a-smart-tvs/)(There are different ways to block ads on your smart TV.\n\nThese methods differ from each platform and your technical ability to understand your Internet connection and the back end of your smart TV.) TV ads.
1.2.5.2.4. Con: Advertisements are a common aspect of modern life, and pose the same risks regardless of medium.
1.2.5.2.4.1. Pro: Advertisements are present in newspapers, cinemas, and on billboards, yet they do not make these mediums bad for people.
1.2.5.2.5. Con: The more intelligent the style of programming, the more intelligent the advertisements, as they are [dependent on the channel](https://adage.com/article/datacenter/applebees-still-cnn-backs-msnbc-and-fox-news-ukraine-war-coverage/2405376) and specific show airing.
1.2.5.3. Pro: The content of many TV shows is mindless, which is harmful to the viewer.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: Viewers may want to relax by watching simple, entertaining programs which they do not need to intellectually engage with.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Con: Using one's brain is a natural and beneficial part of life. To not use it can cause it to [deteriorate](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation).
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Characters in [popular sitcoms](https://www.ranker.com/list/sitcom-characters-who-got-dumber-over-time/donn-saylor) have been known to become stupider as the series progresses and the script quality deteriorates.
1.2.5.3.3. Pro: [A number of TV channels](https://www.ranker.com/list/7-tv-channels-that-forgot-what-they_re-about/jf-sargent) have dumbed down their content.
1.2.5.4. Con: The quality of any given TV show is subjective.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Whether art is considered 'good' or 'bad' by the majority greatly depends on its contents.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Propaganda can be [considered art](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20130703-can-propaganda-be-great-art)(When it comes to visual art, common sense suggests that propaganda is at odds with greatness. Take the famous recruitment poster issued by the British government at the start of the First World War, featuring Lord Kitchener’s stern, moustachioed face staring out above the slogan ‘Your Country Needs YOU’. It is a memorable and effective piece of graphic design – but hardly quality art.\n\nCan art commissioned by the state ever be any good? “Art is something subversive,” Pablo Picasso once said. “If art is ever given the keys to the city, it will be because it’s been so watered down, rendered so impotent, that it’s not worth fighting for.”), however it can also be used to support bad things, such as an oppressive government, or a war.
1.2.5.4.1.2. Con: The fact that art can [elicit emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_and_emotion#Types_of_elicited_emotions), whether they are good or bad, makes it an inherently good thing to have in society, regardless of the quality of the art.
1.2.5.4.2. Con: The quality of a show can be measured through the quality of the script, acting, special effects, and cinematography.
1.2.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.
1.2.5.6. Pro: Nearly [one-third of UK adults](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/21/nearly-a-third-of-tv-viewers-think-programme-quality-is-getting-worse)(Almost a third of TV viewers reckon that the quality of programmes got worse last year, according to a new report.\n\nThe annual Ofcom report, titled UK audience attitudes towards broadcast media, found that 30% of the adults surveyed believed that programming quality worsened in 2015.\n\nThe main reasons given for the drop in quality were more repeats, a lack of variety and an overall lack of quality in programming.\n\nJust 17% felt that programme quality improved last year. The figures are broadly the same that Ofcom has found each year since 2008.) believe that TV programming gets worse every year.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: People might be exposed to poorer quality shows more often without the quality of shows decreasing overall.
1.2.5.6.2. Pro: If TV programming continually gets worse annually, then it may reach a floor where there is no quality programming being produced at all.
1.3. Con: TV can be an educational tool.
1.3.1. Con: TV can only be educational if one is tuned into an educational program.
1.3.1.1. Con: One can learn from any number of shows; the program does not need to be explicitly educational for people to learn.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Movies like The Godfather not only educate viewers about how mafias operate but also serve as a warning about violence being a [counterproductive tool](https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/the-godfather-part-iii-ending-explained.html)(This time, after once again doing away with his remaining foes, Michael loses his daughter, Mary \(Sofia Coppola\), when she gets in the way of a bullet intended for him \(fired, it should be noted, by an assassin dressed as a priest\). Michael wails over the body of his dead child in an extended scene that goes on for a lot longer than such scenes are usually allowed to last. It goes on for so long, in fact, that even the other distraught members of the family seem surprised by his grief. We don’t initially hear Michael’s screaming; the sound cuts out, so we only see it, while hearing the immortal Intermezzo from Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana \(the opera they’ve all just been watching\), which both highlights and tempers the melodramatic intensity of the scene.) \(source contains spoilers\) to achieve desired ends.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Many TV shows have [incidental educational value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_television#Incidental_educational_value), which can help to educate viewers without being the main focus of the program.
1.3.1.2. Pro: With the popularity of more entertaining and instantly gratifying channels displaying [sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_television_channels), movies or [reality TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television), there is little to convince viewers to watch educational content.
1.3.2. Con: Fictional programmes have [higher ratings](https://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/4-signs-that-educational-tv-totally-dead/), thereby reducing the incentive to produce educational ones.
1.3.2.1. Con: TV shows can be simultaneously entertaining and educational, such as [Sesame Street](https://www.sesamestreet.org/toolkits/learning).
1.3.2.2. Con: There are other important incentives to produce educational content other than ratings or money. Documentaries can be used to [generate awareness for an issue](https://www.oncefilms.com/blog/why-are-documentaries-important)(Feature films are designed to inspire and conjure some type of emotional response. With documentary film productions comes a sense of urgency to change the world around us, to take action. Sure, emotions play a big part in that, but documentarians aim to challenge your perspective and educate the masses.) and for the express purpose of educating the audience.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Production budgets for TV programming can be upwards of [millions per hour](https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/tv-series-budgets-costs-rising-peak-tv-1202570158/)(The estimates on the cost of content that emerged from these interviews peg the typical range of the production budget for high-end cable and streaming dramas at $5 million-$7 million an hour, while single-camera half hours on broadcast and cable run from $1.5 million to more than $3 million. With the exception of HBO, which made its mark with lavish productions, that’s a significant increase, during just the past five years, over what had been $3 million-$4 million for cable dramas and around $1 million-$1.5 million for single-camera half hours.). With such a large investment required, producers will likely aim to create programmes that get the highest ratings possible in order to ensure a return.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Channels that were strictly educational in the past, such as Discovery, have [devolved into reality-TV channels](https://qz.com/249615/the-sad-devolution-of-discovery-channel/)(Shark Week isn’t really about sharks—it’s about ratings. And it’s more evidence that the Discovery Channel, also home to Amish Mafia, among other programs of questionable authenticity, has not been interested in broadcasting scientific fact for quite some time.\n\nDiscovery’s shift away from fact-based programming is part of the much larger trend of American cable channels losing their identities.).
1.3.3. Pro: TV offers an important means of acquiring information on news and current affairs.
1.3.3.1. Con: The [internet](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/the-internet-is-now-officially-more-popular-than-cable-in-the-u-s/) is becoming a bigger source of news and information.
1.3.3.2. Con: With just [six corporations owning 90% of the media](https://www.morriscreative.com/6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america/), it is highly unlikely television will broadcast an unbiased and full spectrum of information.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: In the US, [40% of local news channels](https://www.ijpr.org/business-and-labor/2019-07-16/who-owns-your-local-news-rosebud-media-and-sinclair-broadcasting-each-invest-in-the-medford-experiment)(America's biggest broadcast media company is financially backing the owner of the Rogue Valley’s largest newspaper in a way that’s raising questions about the influence of outside money on local news.\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group reaches about 40 percent of American households, owning or operating nearly 200 local television stations nationwide.\n\nSinclair has also gained a controversial reputation for airing commentaries that reflect the views of its executive chairman, David Smith, a political ally of President Trump. \n\nNot many news consumers were aware of Sinclair until last year, when it required its local anchors to read an editorial echoing Trump’s criticisms of the media, as highlighted by a video from the website Deadspin.) are owned by Sinclair Broadcasting; they have used their power to push political agendas in the past.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Many TV networks run [24-hour news programming](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourNewsNetworks), allowing people to access information at any time.
1.3.3.4. Pro: News TV channels that broadcast live can offer immediate reporting and commentary on events, sometimes as they occur.
1.3.4. Con: TV contributes to people becoming less intelligent.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The mean time spent watching television during childhood and adolescence [is significantly associated](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/486063) with leaving school without qualifications and negatively associated with attaining a university degree.
1.3.4.2. Pro: People who watch the most TV have [impaired mental abilities](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/watching-lots-of-tv-makes-you-stupid-says-american-universities-a6759026.html)(Watching TV for hours impairs your mental ability, according to study.\n\nResearchers from the Universities of California and San Francisco studied the link between watching TV and cognitive functioning.\n\nThe results, published in the JAMA Psychaiatry Journal, found the more TV people watched, the worse they performed in a series of intelligence tests.).
1.3.4.3. Pro: TV impairs children's language skills.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: TV is [linked](https://www.parentingscience.com/effects-of-television-on-children-learning-speech.html) with slower language acquisition because TV time tends to displace conversation time between babies and adults.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: TV has been shown to negatively affect the [frontopolar area](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/25/5/1188/311796)(After correcting for confounding factors, we found positive effects of TV viewing on rGMV of the frontopolar and medial prefrontal areas in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, positive effects of TV viewing on rGMV/rWMV of areas of the visual cortex in cross-sectional analyses, and positive effects of TV viewing on rGMV of the hypothalamus/septum and sensorimotor areas in longitudinal analyses. We also confirmed negative effects of TV viewing on verbal intelligence quotient \(IQ\) in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. These anatomical correlates may be linked to previously known effects of TV viewing on verbal competence, aggression, and physical activity. In particular, the present results showed effects of TV viewing on the frontopolar area of the brain, which has been associated with intellectual abilities.) of the brain, impacting the verbal abilities of children.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: People [learn English](https://reallifeglobal.com/lewtv-compilation/)(On the other hand, watching TV Series is extremely FUN and ENGAGING. You look forward to it, you feel immersed in the story, and if you do it right, it can be a very powerful way to learn English.\n\nIn fact, as we’ve taught in our popular Fluent with Friends \(TV Series\) Course, the most effective English learners combine the best of both worlds: the structure and logic of English lessons, and the fun and engagement of authentic, real life spoken English. And there’s no better place to start than TV series.\n\nToday, I’m going to share with you 15 awesome TV series scenes and lessons that will help you understand real English, without getting lost, without missing the jokes, and without subtitles, from some of the most popular TV shows, including Friends, Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, Two and a Half Men, and Seinfeld\).) in non-English speaking countries, such as [Finland](http://www.teachhub.com/how-television-can-actually-help-learning), by watching [American sitcoms](https://www.kaplaninternational.com/blog/friends-helps-learn-english-40) with subtitles.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Con: This contributes to the [Americanization](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/13/american-english-language-study) of the English language, which could erase smaller dialects of English, such as [Scottish English](https://www.thoughtco.com/scottish-english-1691929)(Scottish English is a broad term for the varieties of the English language spoken in Scotland.\n\nScottish English \(SE\) is customarily distinguished from Scots, which is regarded by some linguists as a dialect of English and by others as a language in its own right. \(Altogether separate is Gaelic, the English name for the Celtic language of Scotland, now spoken by just over one percent of the population.\)) and Hiberno-English \([p. 57](https://droverreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/drvol2201911laurick.pdf)(DESPITE GAELIC’S LONG HISTORY as Ireland’s native language,\nEnglish usage has increased drastically within the past 200\nyears, effectively usurping Gaelic.

1.3.4.3.4. Pro: Children who watch more than two hours of television a day, especially those with a [TV in their own rooms](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2005/borzekowski-tv)(Overall, children who had a television set in the bedroom but did not have a computer at home scored the lowest, while students without TV in the bedroom but with access to a computer at home scored the highest. Students who gained a television in the bedroom over the course of the school year scored lower in all areas than those who had their TV taken away during the same period.), scored significantly lower on standardized tests than their counterparts.
1.3.4.3.4.1. Con: The same research found that there was no consistent negative association between [test scores and hours spent watching TV](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2005/borzekowski-tv)(The researchers did not find a consistent negative association between test scores and the amount of television watched per week.).
1.3.4.3.4.1.1. Con: Test scores are [not a useful form](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/standardized-tests-suck-fix-data-not-less/)(But when it comes to education, our data-collection methods fundamentally haven't changed since the ACT was first introduced in 1959. Unlike our modern methods, tests are decoupled from the action that they are measuring. They don't track the process of learning, but the ability to demonstrate it at a later date. That can be valuable---what good is learning something if you can’t later show that you've learned it?---but it also creates fuzziness in what's being measured.\n\nTake the familiar problem of "teaching to the test." Tests like PARCC aren't just dipstick-like check-ins; teachers and administrators actively adjust their lesson plans specifically to boost test performance. So the tests are measuring the teacher's ability to teach, not general knowledge, but that specific test.) of demonstrating educational achievement.
1.3.4.4. Con: Throughout history, people have claimed that different pastimes and new technology is contributing to a decline in intelligence. This does not mean that it is the case.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Plato argued that writing would cause people to have [no memories, and make people stupider](https://fs.blog/an-old-argument-against-writing/)(And so it is that you by reason of your tender regard for the writing that is your offspring have declared the very opposite of its true effect. If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls. They will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks.).
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: Some have argued that [ubiquitous access to calculators](https://theconversation.com/weapons-of-maths-destruction-are-calculators-killing-our-ability-to-work-it-out-in-our-head-44900)(Since the 1980s we have had access to calculators of various types. Today, we can include computers and smartphones – which are attached to our hip 24/7. So does this ubiquitous access to calculators affect our ability to do maths in our heads like we used to?\n\nThirty years ago calculators promised immense opportunity – opportunity, alas, that brought considerable controversy. The sceptics predicted students would not be able to compute even simple calculations mentally or on paper. Multiplication, basic facts, knowledge would disappear. Calculators would become a crutch.\n\nThe controversy has not dissipated over time. As recently as 2012, the UK government announced it intended to ban calculators from primary classrooms on the grounds that students use them too much and too soon.) is killing the ability for people to do math in their heads.
1.3.4.4.3. Con: Technology tends to help simplify processes, [freeing up brainpower](https://uaenews.ekumkum.com/phones-make-you-smarter-not-dumber-by-freeing-up-brain-power/)(But tests of 158 Britons between the ages of 18 and 71 found that putting key details into a phone or device helped improve memory, and meant they could recall unsaved facts.\n\nDr Sam Gilbert, from University College London, said: “When people had to remember for themselves, they used their memory power to remember the most important information.\n\n“But when they were able to use the device, they saved highly important information on the device and instead used their own memory for less important information.\n\n“Far from causing digital dementia, using an external memory device may even improve our memory.”) for people to achieve greater heights and further advance technology.
1.3.5. Con: Education is not necessarily beneficial. Shows like [Breaking Bad](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/general-science/real-breaking-bad-story#:~:text=The%20chemistry%20in%20the%20show,from%20some%20commercial%20cold%20remedies.), for example, provide key pieces of information on how to cook meth, but this is not particularly edifying.
1.3.5.1. Con: While the show does depict the cooking of meth, it does [not depict or discuss crucial steps](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/does-breaking-bad-teach-fans-how-to-make-meth-scientists-have-the-answer.html/)(However, in 2011, NPR talked to the show’s science adviser, Donna Nelson, who assured everyone that you can not learn how to make meth by watching Breaking Bad. When the manufacturing process is presented on the show, the creators and scientists have been very careful to leave out some of the most important steps to ensure that no one is able to make the drug at home.) in the process, so the show does not educate users on how to create meth.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Some people might lack the intelligence necessary to understand that key steps have been left out, and try to [create meth anyway](https://www.vice.com/en/article/exmg5n/a-comprehensive-guide-to-cooking-meth-on-breaking-bad)(As a chemist and someone interested in psychoactive drugs, I'm frequently asked if I watch the AMC series Breaking Bad and if the show accurately portrays clandestine chemistry. I am a huge fan of the show and frequently watch it while working in the lab late at night. Although the clandestine chemistry always appeared accurate at first glance, I desired a more detailed critique of Walter White's syntheses. But season after season my thirst for technical analysis was left unquenched; I found a few articles that touched on the clandestine chemistry, but none were comprehensive. After dedicating the last seven years of my life to organic chemistry, it felt like a natural departure from writing my dissertation to examine this matter more closely.), resulting in disastrous consequences.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Such consequences are not the result of TV, but rather the viewer's own stupidity and criminal intentions.
1.3.5.1.1.2.

1.3.6. Pro: Multiple studies suggest that watching TV can lead to beneficial educational outcomes.
1.3.6.1. Pro: [A study](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/watching_tv_can_boost_emotional_intelligence)(Two years ago, groundbreaking research revealed that reading literary fiction can help us understand the inner lives of others. Now, a newly published paper finds watching quality television drama can do the same thing.\n\n“Film narratives, as well as written narrative, may facilitate the understanding of others’ minds,” write University of Oklahoma psychologists Jessica Black and Jennifer Barnes in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts.\n\nBlack and Barnes took as their starting point a 2013 study that found “the ability to interpret the mental states and emotions of others” \(which psychologists call “theory of mind”\) can be bolstered by reading literature.) finds that watching high-quality television dramas can increase our ability to read other people's emotions.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Reading is at least equally, if not more, able to help people [increase empathy](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books#increases-empathy)(And speaking of sensing pain, researchTrusted Source has shown that people who read literary fiction — stories that explore the inner lives of characters — show a heightened ability to understand the feelings and beliefs of others.\n\nResearchers call this ability the “theory of mind,” a set of skills essential for building, navigating, and maintaining social relationships.\n\nWhile a single session of reading literary fiction isn’t likely to spark this feeling, researchTrusted Source shows that long-term fiction readers do tend to have a better-developed theory of mind.). TV is not essential in this regard.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Children who watched three or more hours a day were three months ahead of those who watched less than an hour a day, a [study](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/10138281/Letting-children-watch-hours-of-TV-improves-academic-ability-study-claims.html)(Researchers at the University of London found that children who watched three or more hours a day were three months ahead of their peers who watched less than an hour a day) found.
1.3.6.3. Pro: [Findings suggest](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/81244.php) that a combination of visual and verbal information on television is an effective learning tool.
1.3.6.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.4.
1.3.7. Pro: TV can inspire inventions and technological progress.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Shows like Shark Tank can [inspire innovation](https://www.inc.com/anis-uzzaman/how-shark-tank-startup-competitions-spur-innovation.html) and bring new technology to society.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: Innovation and capital investment existed [long before television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment#History) and shows like [Shark Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank) or [Dragons' Den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons%27_Den_\(British_TV_programme\)).
1.3.7.2. Pro: Science-fiction TV and film [have inspired](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/how-hollywood-movies-and-tv-shows-impact-real-science)(Multidimensional portrayals of scientists and their work can also galvanize young people to enter STEM fields. This is evident in the Scully Effect, which theorizes that The X-Files character Dana Scully motivated young women to pursue science careers. As one of the first prominent onscreen female scientists, the skeptical medical doctor and FBI agent also made ripple effects within the entertainment industry, allegedly influencing characters like forensic anthropologist Temperance “Bones” Brennan from Bones.\n\nAs a result, more than 60 percent of women familiar with Dana Scully say that she “increased their belief in the importance of STEM,”) many people to pursue careers in STEM fields.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Many depictions of science-related TV shows are [not realistic](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2017/09/20/most-americans-see-science-related-entertainment-shows-and-movies-in-either-a-neutral-or-positive-light/)(While popular entertainment can inspire and inform, it can also create misconceptions. Many in the scientific community have worried over how such media influence people’s impressions of, support for, and understanding of scientific inquiry, knowledge and careers in these fields. For example, some express concern that Hollywood’s portrayal of science creates unrealistic standards for criminal evidence in the public mind. Although studies about this “CSI effect” remain inconclusive, the issue was deemed serious enough to merit inclusion in a report published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and helped launch an advisory network to connect scientists and engineers with entertainment industry professionals.\n\n\nThis study finds viewers of science-related entertainment believe that these films and shows provide, on the whole, a positive impression of working in science, technology and medicine.).
1.3.7.2.2. Pro: Shows began to [hire scientific advisors](https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/how-hollywood-movies-and-tv-shows-impact-real-science)(While onscreen depictions of stretchy mutants or a toilet-terrorizing dinosaur may seem completely independent from real-life research, movie and TV production crews have spent decades seeking out scientists to fact-check scripts and special effects. \n\nPropelled by the science fiction boom beginning in the 1970s, Hollywood has since solicited expert knowledge to make scenes more plausible. \n\nAs it turns out, even the wackiest plots can benefit from some expert knowledge. For example, Anne Simon, a virologist at the University of Maryland and consultant on The X-Files, broke it to the series creator that a virus couldn’t, in fact, theoretically transform into a monster. \(It could, however, transform cells into terrifying creatures.\)\n\nThe benefits go both ways: Conversely, popular media has even helped spark research developments and garner funding in science fields. And in the last decade, it’s become far easier to bridge the worlds of science and fiction) in the 1970s to make their productions more accurate and believable, inspiring a new generation of scientists.
1.3.7.3. Con: TV [rots the brain](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/13/the-proof-is-in-tv-really-does-rot-your-brain)(Until now, claims that television makes you stupid have only been backed up by anecdotal evidence. True, at a certain point it does seem that people who watch vast amounts of TV do become so intellectually impaired that they start involuntarily clapping along to theme tunes like imprisoned sea lions performing for fish, but that isn’t anything you could write a medical paper about.\n\nNow, sadly, science has trundled along to back it up. According to Dr Ryan Dougherty, from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, the more television you watch in middle age, the lower your volume in grey matter. Examining the viewing habits of 599 American adults between 1990 and 2011, Dougherty found that those who watched an above average amount of television showed reduced volume in their frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Basically, your mum was right: TV really does rot your brain.); it is unlikely that people who watch significant amounts of TV will be the next inspirational figure, found a company, or spur technological innovation.
1.3.8. Pro: TV shows can lead children to pursue an interest in science and technology.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Science shows like [Beakman's World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106367/) inspire children to get interested in science by teaching them facts and concepts that they might otherwise find boring or intimidating.
1.3.8.2.

It's gonna make a real difference to America's future, I promise you.") for inspiring young people to pursue the sciences.
1.3.8.3. Con: Having an interest in science or technology is meaningless without the grades to further pursue these fields. TV has a detrimental effect on [grades](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tv-not-instagram-hurt-students-grades)(“Spending more time in passive, noneducational activities such as watching TV and playing video games is associated with decreased academic performance,” said Muth, an American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson...).
1.3.9. Con: [Many viewers](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/bbc-four-and-the-dumbing-down-of-british-television)(The BBC needs to regain its ambition when it comes to factual television. That this can be hugely successful has been shown by both Netflix and HBO. It also has the signal advantage of having become far, far cheaper. Technology allows documentaries to be shot by only a handful of people these days, or indeed by just one. For a BBC facing budget cuts, it makes financial sense to make more documentaries and fewer dramas; documentaries come at a fraction of the price. Yet it’s not so much that the BBC is not meeting this challenge; it’s that they seem so blithely unaware it’s a challenge at all.) think the educational quality of TV shows is generally poor.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Many programmes are described as documentaries even though they are [fictional](https://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/4-signs-that-educational-tv-totally-dead/)(So obviously viewers got more than a little pissed off to see Discovery kicking off Shark Week with a "documentary" about finding evidence that megalodons still exist, only to end with a three-second disclaimer telling everyone it was complete hogwash. For our very few readers who weren't in on the controversy, the megalodon was a gigantic prehistoric shark that's been dead for millions of years. The Discovery Channel, on the other hand, knew said fact when airing this crockumentary.\n\nUnfortunately, 79 percent of viewers assumed this was a real documentary. But the worst part is that the idea of faking educational documentaries isn't anything new. It happened just last year when Animal Planet ran another fake show about the existence of mermaids. And like the megalodon, people assumed they weren't just blowing smoke out of their reverse food holes.).
1.3.9.2. Pro: TV executives want dramas to be [dumbed down](https://dailyuknews.com/entertainment/line-of-duty-creator-jed-mercurio-was-told-to-dumb-down-plots-to-earlier-shows-he-worked-on/) with simplistic storylines in order to cater to passive watchers.

Con: The cited [article](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/bbc-four-and-the-dumbing-down-of-british-television)(Some of the most extraordinary programmes made recently were documentaries: the award-winning For Sama, seed funded by Channel 4 News and chronicling the Syrian war from the point of view of one family living in Aleppo; Kingmaker’s startling revelations about Imelda Marcos in the Philippines; Netflix’s The Edge Of Democracy about Brazil. My son got me to watch Netflix’s eye-opening 13th about black rights in the States in the wake of the George Floyd protests, which has been required viewing for many of his generation. None were made by the BBC.\n\nThe BBC needs to regain its ambition when it comes to factual television. That this can be hugely successful has been shown by both Netflix and HBO.) acknowledges the [high-quality educational](https://www.twinkl.ie/blog/the-best-educational-tv-shows-on-netflix-for-children)(Here’s an idea: there are loads of educational children’s shows on Netflix to try out. Access to Netflix is like having one of the world’s largest libraries of video content at your fingertips.\n\nThere’s something for almost every aspect of education: children can learn about dinosaurs, outer space or the human body.) content that is available outside of the BBC network.
1.3.9.4. Pro: TV shows throughout Europe are becoming less informative and more sensational, a European watchdog [has found](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4334718.stm)(The institute examined TV ownership, content and regulation in 20 European countries including the UK.\n\nIt found a drop in quality of news and cultural reporting in countries where a few companies often control a country's entire TV market and those which have opened up to a flood of commercial broadcasters.\n\nIn France, for example, commercial network TF1 attracts almost one-third of the national audience and half of its total TV advertising revenues.\n\nDigital broadcasting could encourage more competition and choice in programming, the report said.\n\nHowever, as current broadcast regulation does not cover digital broadcasting in most countries, it risks being dominated by a relatively small number of commercial companies.\n\nThe Budapest-based institute said governments should not let the market determine broadcasting policy, and should automatically give public service stations licences for digital broadcasting.).
1.4. Pro: TV worsens many societal ills.
1.4.1. Pro: TV sexualizes people.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Teens who watch programs that contain a lot of sexual content are [twice as likely](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97637718) to be involved in a pregnancy.
1.4.1.2. Con: All forms of media, including [painting and sculpture](https://www.entitymag.com/women-art/), have been accused of sexualizing people. It is a greater reflection of humanity than the means by which sexualization occurs.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Heavy television viewers \([four hours or more per evening](http://humanevents.com/2007/06/13/does-watching-tv-damage-character/)(The National Cultural Values Survey reveals a striking correlation between greater exposure to television and permissive moral views. Heavy television viewers \(four hours or more per evening\) are less committed to character virtues like honesty and charity, and more permissive about sex, abortion and homosexuality. Light television viewers \(one hour or less per evening\) are more likely to attend religious services and live their lives by God’s principles.)\) are more permissive about sex, abortions, and homosexuality.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Television [tends to portray](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871774/) sexual roles in a stereotypic manner that can set up unrealistic expectations.
1.4.1.5. Pro: [Two studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871774/) have linked exposure to sex on television with earlier sexual initiation.
1.4.2. Pro: TV can be used to brainwash people and prevent them from escaping from their [information silo](https://nulab.com/blog/collaboration/what-are-information-silos-and-how-do-you-prevent-them/)(Information silos stem from poor communication between departments or teams. When teams fail to share information, each group has to make decisions based on their individual data and objectives.\n\nThe problem is a departmental or team project doesn’t exist in a vacuum; they’re all part of a larger purpose. Organizational goals depend on the diverse expertise of different teams, which means everyone needs to understand the big picture. Teams that are cut off from one another can’t work from a single source of truth and get things done efficiently.).
1.4.2.1. Pro: The limited number of corporate media outlets keeps people in an information bubble.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: TV can be used to view information from different sources. It is the viewer's fault if they are kept in an "information bubble."
1.4.2.1.2. Con: People can choose if and what they want to watch.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: It depends on your level of access to TV. Some people may only have access to basic \(free to air\) television where there are limited options. Others may have access to TV, Netflix, Stan, cable TV, international content, internet based \(etc.\) where the choices and content are much wider.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: TV news media is often accused of being [ideologically biased](https://www.bridgealliance.us/beyond_left_vs_right_14_types_of_ideological_bias). Therefore watching TV could be exposing viewers to a form of propaganda.
1.4.2.1.4.1. Con: Claims of media bias are [generally overblown](https://theconversation.com/claims-of-ideological-bias-among-the-media-may-be-overblown-135617).
1.4.2.1.4.2. Pro: Media bias charts have been developed to illustrate where certain news networks [fall on the political spectrum](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart).
1.4.2.1.5. Pro: More than 91 million viewers in Brazil, the equivalent of the audience for the Super Bowl, tune into [just one channel](https://www.economist.com/business/2014/06/05/globo-domination)(WHEN the football World Cup begins on June 12th in Brazil, tens of millions of Brazilians will watch the festivities on TV Globo, the country’s largest broadcast network. But for Globo it will be just another day of vast audiences. No fewer than 91m people, just under half the population, tune in to it each day: the sort of audience that, in the United States, is to be had only once a year, and only for the one network that has won the rights that year to broadcast American football’s Super Bowl championship game.\n\nGlobo is surely Brazil’s most powerful company, given its reach into so many homes. Its nearest competitor in free-to-air television, Record, has an audience share of only about 13%. America’s most popular broadcast network, CBS, has a mere 12% share of audience during prime time, and its main competitors have around 8%.) every night; the owner of the network can exert a significant amount of control over what those people see.
1.4.2.1.6. Con: Watching a variety of channels, content, and news sources can help someone avoid getting stuck in an information bubble.
1.4.2.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.4.2.2. Pro: There are lots of examples of the use of [subliminal messaging](http://www.progressiveawareness.org/research_desk_reference/legal_status_of_subliminal_communication.html) in broadcasts.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Subliminal messaging is often used to sell products, which can often times be harmful, such as [energy drinks and alcohol](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/feb/04/tvandradio.television1)(These rules were apparently drawn up for the benefit of our health and safety\[...\]. Basically the rules outlaw "images of very brief duration" because of a condition called photosensitive epilepsy that is triggered by flashing images on TVs.\n\nThe phenomenon was demonstrated rather graphically last year when a TV cartoon based on Pokemon, a computer game character with strangely flashing eyes, was broadcast in Japan. It led to an unprecedented number of children being hospitalised.\n\nBut despite the tight controls, agencies are always trying to experiment with the notion of subliminal communication. Trevor Beattie, the adman behind the Wonderbra posters and the FCUK work for French Connection, cheekily played with the idea in a controversial poster last year for the fashion chain. This actually featured the words "subliminal", "advertising" and "experiment" arranged in such a way, with the first letters highlighted, so as to spell out SEX.).
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: [Subliminal messaging](https://www.businessinsider.com/subliminal-ads-2011-5?r=US&IR=T) has been a part of Coca-Cola and many other corporations' advertising campaigns.
1.4.2.3. Pro: There’s [evidence](https://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/does_tv_actually_brainwash_americans/) to suggest that the act of watching TV makes people more passive and accepting of authority.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Television advertising can [influence attitudes](https://opentextbc.ca/introconsumerbehaviour/chapter/changing-attitudes/)(There is substantial evidence that advertising is effective in changing attitudes. After the R. J. Reynolds Company started airing its Joe Camel ads for cigarettes on TV in the 1980s, Camel’s share of cigarette sales to children increased dramatically. But persuasion can also have more positive outcomes. For instance, a review of the research literature indicates that mass-media anti-smoking campaigns are associated with reduced smoking rates among both adults and youth \(Friend & Levy, 2001\). Persuasion is also used to encourage people to donate to charitable causes, to volunteer to give blood, and to engage in healthy behaviors.) and public opinion over certain controversial subjects.
1.4.2.5. Con: This is not a failure of TV, but rather a failure of people to apply [critical thinking](https://www.teflhongkong.com/blog/critical-thinking-why-is-it-important-and-how-to-teach-them-to-students/)(Critical thinking is a process in which someone evaluates an issue from multiple perspectives to be critical and logical in their evaluation. In critical thinking, one asks critical questions that lead to developing a critical understanding of a problem.\n\nWhen herd mentality is becoming increasingly and frighteningly common, critical thinking is becoming rarer and more sought after than ever. Being able to think critically means that you can take your beliefs through the filters of logic. It also means that you are capable of constant introspection, clarity, and an independent mindset.) to their media consumption.
1.4.2.6. Con: The most effective means of brainwashing are [family and friends](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/probing-question-does-brainwashing-exist/)(So what drove those who did join? The testimonials of friends and family, he says. "When a close friend or family member tells you that a leader or belief has changed them into a new and better person, it's the most effective ' brainwashing' that you can receive," he adds.\n\nFinke emphasizes that the power of friends and family to influence us plays a role not only in religious conversion, but political and social conversion as well. "Propaganda and information control may get your attention and encourage change, but for true, long-lasting conversion on matters of importance, these persuasive techniques must be supplemented by support from someone you trust."), however this does not mean that they are inherently bad.
1.4.2.7. Pro: The CIA has [a history](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-cia-and-the-media-50-facts-the-world-needs-to-know/5471956) of influencing public opinion through the media, for instance with [Project Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird).
1.4.3. Pro: Smart TVs threaten people's privacy.
1.4.3.1. Con: An easy solution would be to use an older tube or flat-screen TV without internet connectivity and newer [technologies](https://techpenny.com/best-smart-tvs-built-in-camera/), rather than a smart TV.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Most of the 'cable' providers in the Netherlands provide TV via internet connection, so one can not really go without a smart TV. Also if you want to keep up with the latest in quality you're probably forced to buy a newer smart TV.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: A regular TV with a [plug-in streaming device](https://www.wizcase.com/blog/stop-your-smart-tv-from-spying-on-you/)(But what about Netflix and other streaming services? I recommend you access these platforms with a streaming device like Google Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV, or a Fire TV stick. That way, you’ll get the same features as a smart TV — just without the spying. Using a VPN with your streaming device will add more security. It will also allow you to unblock various streaming services like Netflix libraries from other countries.) would be a reasonable solution to prevent spying.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: The need to purchase and install an additional device is not an ideal solution for people on a budget.
1.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Most add-on streaming devices are [inexpensive](https://www.reviews.org/tv-service/best-streaming-devices/)(Device\nPrice*\n\nRoku Streaming Stick+\n$43.99\n \nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K\n$39.99\n\nNVIDIA SHIELD TV Pro\n$199.99\n\nChromecast with Google TV\n$49.99\n\nApple TV 4K\n$159.99–$208.55\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube\n$119.99\n\nRoku Ultra\n$93.90\n\nNVIDIA SHIELD\n$143.99) and affordable to people on a budget.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Con: Roku, one of the most popular streaming devices, [collects massive amounts of data](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/roku-streaming-sticks/)(Roku is like the nosy, gossipy neighbor of connected devices. They track just about everything they can. And then they share that data with lots of people. According to Roku's privacy policy, they share your personal data with advertisers to show you targeted ads and create profiles about you over time and across different services and devices. Roku also gives advertisers detailed data about your interactions with advertisements, your demographic data, and audience segment. Roku shares viewing data with measurement providers who may target you with ads. Roku may share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.) and could be used to spy on consumers just as easily as a smart TV.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The CIA [allegedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/03/07/cia-wikileaks-samsung-smart-tv-hack-security/#4e14d5d74bcd) hacked Samsung Smart TVs.
1.4.3.3. Con: There [are ways](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/smart-tv-spying-vizio-settlement/) to prevent a Smart TV from spying on you.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: People shouldn't have to take active steps to avoid being spied on by their electrical devices.
1.4.3.4. Pro: [Vizio](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/02/06/these-smart-tvs-were-apparently-spying-on-their-owners/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.060b00160bfd) used 11 million televisions to spy on its customers.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: [Vizio](https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/283617-vizio-claims-smart-tvs-spy-on-you-for-your-own-good) has stated it uses this capacity to best serve its customers.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Samsung has issued a personal privacy statement, warning people not to [discuss personal information around Smart TVs](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-31324892)(Technology giant Samsung is warning its customers to avoid discussing personal information in front of their new smart TV sets.\n\nThe warning applies to viewers who control their sets using its voice activation feature.\n\nIt listens to conversations, and may share any details it hears with Samsung or third parties.).
1.4.4. Con: As TV watching is [so ubiquitous](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1207931/tv-viewers-worldwide-number)(In 2021, 5.36 billion people worldwide will be TV users, according to the Advertising & Media Outlook. The number of global TV viewers is set to steadily increase, and reach approximately 5.68 billion people by 2026.), finding a control group against which to test the causal link between TV and societal ills would prove to be quite difficult.
1.4.4.1. Con: Many countries require television users to pay a [TV license fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licence). Those who do not pay this fee could be established as a control group, as they likely do not have a television.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Anyone who doesn't watch TV would likely be excluded from any potential study based on other factors including being illiterate or in abject poverty, or having some sort of electronic sensitivity that would disqualify them from participating.
1.4.5. Con: TV shows and movies often draw attention to complex social problems.
1.4.5.1. Pro: "[Guess who's coming to dinner?](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/local/2017/04/09/guess-who-s-coming-dinner-legacy-debated-anniversary/15750057007/)" tackled the issue of inter-racial marriage at a time when such unions were controversial, so controversial that the production studio did not want to make a movie that they believed would cost them millions.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Movies like [Kramer vs. Kramer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079417/) and [Mrs. Doubtfire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107614/) challenged traditional gender norms and roles, such as by portraying a woman wanting out of a lifeless marriage and a man willing to change his gender presentation to be close to his kids, respectively.
1.4.5.3. Con: TV is incredibly unrepresentative of [real demographics and diversity](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/04/942574850/more-evidence-tv-doesnt-reflect-real-life-diversity)(For example, women make up 52 percent of the U.S. population, but they show up onscreen 37.9 percent of the time, according to Nielsen's study. It uses a metric called "share of screen" –the percentage of time members of specific groups appear as recurring cast members – to measure how often TV viewers actually see these types of people.\n\nThe numbers get worse for women over age 50. This group is 20 percent of the population, but only gets 8 percent of screen time. Men over age 50, who are 17 percent of the population, get a 14 percent share of screen time – closer to their actual numbers in real life.\n\nLatinos and non-white Hispanics were among the most underrepresented non-white racial groups – a trend also noted in other studies about diversity in Hollywood.), ultimately harming social movements.
1.4.6. Con: TV shows and movies often pay homage to people who have made sacrifices for others. In doing so, they promote empathy, compassion, and altruism.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The couple cuddling in bed as the water rises around them at the end of the movie The Titanic is [based on the true story](https://www.today.com/popculture/great-grandson-elderly-titanic-couple-shares-their-real-story-t120095)(As the Titanic began sinking into the freezing ocean, women and children were ushered into lifeboats, as was the unwritten law of the sea.

When he didn’t follow, she was very concerned and the ship’s officer in charge of lowering that particular lifeboat said, 'Well, Mr. Straus, you’re an elderly man…and we all know who you are....Of course you can enter the lifeboat with your wife,'" Kurzman told TODAY.\n\n"And, my great-grandfather said, 'No. Until I see that every woman and child on board this ship is in a lifeboat, I will not enter into a lifeboat myself.'") of an old wealthy couple who gave up their lifeboat so that others, including their maid, might live.
1.4.6.2. Con: TV shows and movies consistently [misrepresent](https://historycollection.com/movies-totally-misrepresent-these-historic-figures-all-the-time/)(Some of the greatest films of all time are “based on a true story”. But how true are they, really? In many cases, screenwriters have to edit and delete certain aspects of a person’s life in order to make it fit in a 2-hour movie. Most of the time, they’re trying to keep in as many details as they can, and these deletions don’t really change the overarching theme of that person’s life. In other cases, writers and movie directors just go ahead and completely twist the truth until it looks nothing like reality. Here at History Collection, we’re going to talk about some of the historic figures who have been completely misrepresented in TV and film. Keep reading to find out the true stories behind the fiction you’ve seen on screen.) people from history, doing them a disservice and promoting lies.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Many of the stories told on TV and in movies are true stories that were [nearly forgotten to history](https://screenrant.com/best-movies-accurate-depictions-ancient-history-agora/)(After a certain amount of time passes, the line between history and legend becomes a little fuzzy. Some of the physical evidence of these bygone times survives and we can piece together how people lived. Mundane information, like clothing, architecture, or daily social protocol often isn't enough to make a movie, and that's where some of the relative anachronism can happen.\n\nVintage movies about ancient times were usually about Rome and always involved certain famous historic characters that general audiences would already recognize. Since then, the ancient world, on film, has branched out to include comedies, war stories, and serious dramas. These movies don't get everything right, but there's a lot to be said for how they recreate the background, setting, and people of bygone civilizations.).
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Some of the best war movies, such as Schindler's List, Hacksaw Ridge, and Dunkirk, are true stories. Many audiences learned some [nearly-forgotten history](https://whatnerd.com/best-war-movies-based-on-true-stories/)(Nothing makes a film more shocking, tragic, or inspiring than the truth. Tons of war movies have been made over the years, but the most hard-hitting ones are usually based on true stories.\n\nThese heroic—and oftentimes horrific—tales celebrate the lives of real people who suffered at the hands of war, whether while behind enemy lines, navigating the skies, or even sat at a desk.\n\nRisks were taken, sacrifices were made, and a few people managed to get out on the other side alive. These people have now had their journeys told on the big screen.) by seeing these stories for the first time on the big or small screen.
1.4.7. Con: TV brings people together.
1.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.4.7.2. Con: Television can create division with [shows](https://www.humanityinaction.org/knowledgebase/557-mass-media-the-construction-of-ethnic-stereotypes) that perpetuate false stereotypes.

Pro: Many TV shows [perpetuate](https://psmag.com/social-justice/reality-tv-perpetuates-the-stereotype-of-the-angry-african-american)(A comprehensive look at one week's work of popular reality shows found black contestants were "depicted as more verbally aggressive, and more likely to be the victims of verbal aggression, than other races/ethnicities," write Jack Glascock of Illinois State University and independent scholar Catherine Preston-Schreck.\n\nThis is driven by the fact that "African-American women were more likely than men to be involved in verbal aggression, both as aggressor and victim," they add.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, examined "a composite week of the most popular prime-time broadcast and cable reality TV shows" at the beginning of the 2013–14 season. The researchers examined a single episode of 42 different shows, including The Amazing Race, Shark Tank, Project Runway, Duck Dynasty, Undercover Boss, and Top Chef.) the stereotype of the 'angry African American.'
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: Some shows can [reinforce](https://www.chconline.org/resourcelibrary/stereotypes-movies-tv-impact-kids-development-downloadable/) the idea that masculine traits are more acceptable than feminine traits.
1.4.7.2.2.1. Pro: Many shows negatively portray gay men as being effeminate, and use it to make them the subject of derision \([p. 11](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/Tuned_Out__2006_.pdf)(Lesbian and gay people are often used as the subject of jokes, and over half, 51 per cent, of all individual gay references were included for comic effect. Most of these revolved around the stereotypes of gay men as either sexually promiscuous or camp and effeminate.)\).
1.4.7.2.3. Con: Any form of media or communication can be used to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The issue lies with the society that tolerates such stereotypes, not the media which they are portrayed in.
1.4.7.2.4. Pro: Popular networks, such as the BBC, [rely heavily](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/Tuned_Out__2006_.pdf)(There are almost no examples of homophobia or homophobic preconceptions being challenged in BBC programming. It is far more usual to see implied gay sexuality used as an insult or as a way of undermining someone.\n\nThe BBC relies heavily on clichéd stereotypes in its portrayal of gay people. It seems reluctant to present lesbian and gay people in everyday scenarios, such as stable relationships or family life.) on the use of stereotypes when portraying gay people, and to use them as the subject of jokes \([p. 8](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/Tuned_Out__2006_.pdf)(Gay people are often used as the subject of jokes on the BBC. Over half, 51 per cent, of all gay references were designed for comic effect. Most of these revolved around stereotypes of sexually predatory or camp and effeminate gay men.)\).
1.4.7.2.5. Con: Television shows can bring people together and break down barriers by striking down stereotypes through authentic portrayals of genuine people.
1.4.7.2.5.1. Pro: When immigrants, especially undocumented workers, were realistically portrayed on TV, [anti-immigrant sentiments fell](https://annenberg.usc.edu/news/research-and-impact/new-study-examines-how-tv-portrayals-immigrants-affect-real-life-actions)(For each of the three shows, viewers who saw the immigration storyline had more inclusive attitudes toward immigrants than those who did not, including greater comfort meeting undocumented people and opposition to criminalizing undocumented immigrants. Those who saw the immigration storylines were also more likely to take certain related actions, such as speaking to a friend about immigration issues or attending an immigration-related community event.\n\n“This new data shows how the power of storytelling can engage audiences, shift mindsets, and move people into action,” said Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Jose Antonio Vargas\[...\]. “We’re calling on creators in the entertainment industry to continue to better develop authentic immigrant characters and storylines, which not only broaden representation, but empower viewers to take action on immigration-related issues.”).
1.4.7.2.5.2.

1.4.7.3.1. Pro: Sitting down together in front of the TV was regarded as the best way of catching up by [more than half of families](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1169456/Families-busy-time-spend-watching-TV.html). A further 12% claimed it was the only time they were ever together in one room.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: A group of people watching TV merely brings them together physically; without interacting with one another, there is no value added in simply being near someone else.
1.4.7.3.2.1. Con: A group of people watching the same TV consume the same programming at the same time. This facilitates discussion and live reaction/interaction between each viewer.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Not only does [media help](https://mediaculturesociety.org/2013/10/10/how-television-brings-us-together-as-a-nation/) to form and promote feelings of nationality, but it also acts as a way for citizens of other nations to experience our country and our culture.
1.4.7.4.1. Pro: TV shows and movies help spread cultural values.
1.4.7.4.2. Con: Over-dependence on foreign production \(e.g in third world countries\) is a form of cultural domination.
1.4.7.5. Pro: For some couples with busy personal and professional lives, watching TV is the only time they spend together.
1.4.7.5.1.

In a state of anxiety, they end up believing that if they somehow bring back the lost passion between the sheets, their relationship too would magically heal. But they are far from the truth. According to a new research, the frequency of cuddling is a better indicator of a happy and healthy relationship than the frequency at which the couples have sex. Which means, the more you cuddle, the stronger your relationship would grow.).
1.4.7.5.3. Con: One quarter of couples are unable to agree on the same show to watch and separate themselves to [watch TV in different rooms](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2325055/Divided-television-A-quarter-couples-spend-evening-separate-rooms-watch-different-shows.html)(A quarter of cohabiting couples have admitted they won't let their loved one come between them and their favourite TV show.\n\nRather than missing an episode of a much-loved soap or the chance to see their football team play on TV, couples will view their channel of choice in separate rooms. \n\nNew research has revealed that a quarter of cohabiting couples spend as many as three evenings in an average week sat in separate rooms in order to watch their desired television shows.).

1.4.7.5.4. Pro: Couples who watch TV together have [stronger relationships](https://www.marieclaire.com.au/television-improves-relationships)(According to a recent study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationship, those who spoon on the sofa to watch episode after episode \(after episode...\) of their favourite show are more committed to each other than those who actually make Saturday night plans.\n\nResearch suggests that this is down to creating a "shared social identity" through pop culture references whether you're forever quoting Friends or can't help but hit pause for lengthy debates mid-documentary. \n\nIn turn, these joint small screen experiences allow couples to "expand their partner's traits, skills and resources" - a process known as self-expansion.).
1.4.8. Pro: TV is responsible for eroding moral values in society.
1.4.8.1.

1.4.8.1.1. Pro: Secular commentators also described controversial shows, such as Little Britain, as "[offensive trash](https://www.nme.com/features/little-britain-blackface-offensive-bbc-2687165)" which featured blackface, and mocked women, the disabled and homosexuals.
1.4.8.1.2. Con: Religious principles are no longer the means of measurement of social moral standards.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Heavy television viewers \([four hours or more per evening](http://humanevents.com/2007/06/13/does-watching-tv-damage-character/)(The National Cultural Values Survey reveals a striking correlation between greater exposure to television and permissive moral views. Heavy television viewers \(four hours or more per evening\) are less committed to character virtues like honesty and charity, and more permissive about sex, abortion and homosexuality. Light television viewers \(one hour or less per evening\) are more likely to attend religious services and live their lives by God’s principles.)\) are less committed to moral values like empathy and honesty.
1.4.8.3.

1.4.9. Pro: [Violence on TV](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-baby-scientist/201801/violent-media-and-aggressive-behavior-in-children) is blamed for causing viewers to imitate violence and [leads to an increase](https://www.apa.org/topics/video-games/violence-harmful-effects)(As a result of 15 years of “consistently disturbing” findings about the violent content of children’s programs, the Surgeon General’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior was formed in 1969 to assess the impact of violence on the attitudes, values, and behavior of viewers. The resulting report and a follow-up report in 1982 by the National Institute of Mental Health identified these major effects of seeing violence on television:\n\n Children may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others.\n Children may be more fearful of the world around them.\n Children may be more likely to behave in aggressive or harmful ways toward others.) in real-world violence and aggression.
1.4.9.1. Pro: The widespread coverage of war, violence, murder, economic crisis, etc, on TV has negative effects on the [collective consciousness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/cultivation-theory)(Findings of nearly four decades of cultivation research on television message systems have unveiled a ‘distorted’ reality: exaggerated crime rates, overrepresentation of violence, gender-role stereotyping, nontraditional family composition, the ‘mean world syndrome,’ and so on \(Morgan et al., 2009\). This misshaped, yet repetitive represented ‘reality,’ gradually dominates the worldview of heavy viewers, who rely on television as their main source of beliefs and values.).
1.4.9.2. Con: Watching violence is bad, not television as a whole.
1.4.9.3. Con: Many things such as [sporting events](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2022/03/12/sports-fans-more-violent-abusive-since-returning-after-worst-covid/6986397001/)("We've noticed, anecdotally, a rapid rise" in instances of aggressive or abusive behavior at high school sporting events, she said in a phone interview.\n\n"It seems to be more frequent, and it seems to be more extreme," she continued.

1.4.9.4. Pro: Violent [Turkish TV shows](https://www.empowordjournalism.com/all-articles/the-relationship-between-turkish-tv-series-and-violence-against-women/)(The high representation of violent behaviours in TV series normalises violent actions while making them attractive to the audiences.

According to the platform’s data, firearms were frequently used as a weapon. On the other hand, the death reason for 100 women remains suspicious. The same platform reported 474 women killed by men in 2019.\n\[...\]\nAs BBC Turkish published on one of their online news platforms, Canan Güllü, who is the president of the Federation of Women’s Associations of Turkey, stated that a lot of Turkish women called the federation in 2011 to report that they were raped in the same way that the woman character raped in one of the Turkish series. \n\[...\]\nAs shown in the example above, audiences are inclined to internalise the behaviour of characters on TV.) have been blamed for increased violence against women.

Con: The British Council developed a useful list of [eight ways to encourage reading](https://www.britishcouncil.my/english/courses-children/resources/encourage-reading-at-home)(Developing a life-long reading habit at an early age can set children up to succeed in learning environments.

When TV characters demonstrate social-emotional skills, children can learn from them. Television shows that depict sharing, getting along with others, or rejecting stereotypes can improve those skills in children \(Mares & Woodard, 2005\). Children may also benefit from TV shows that encourage emotion regulation, befriending diverse children, and solving problems responsibly, although this research is less conclusive \(Christensen, 2013\).).
1.4.10.1.3. Con: The negative effects of TV on children far outweigh the positive effects.
1.4.10.2. Con: The TV rating system exists to prevent children from consuming inappropriate content on TV \([p. 2](http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/TV_Parental_guidelines_Brochure.pdf)(The television industry designed a TV ratings system to give parents more information about the content and age-appropriateness of TV programs.

They are designed to be easily recognizable and simple to use. The Guidelines apply to most television programs, including those directed specifically to young children. However, sports and news shows do not carry the Guidelines.\n\nThe Guidelines appear in the upper left corner of the TV screen at the beginning of TV shows, and often again after commercial breaks.)\).
