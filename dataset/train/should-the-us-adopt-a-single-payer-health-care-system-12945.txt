Discussion Name: Should the US adopt a single-payer health care system?

1. The US should adopt a single-payer health care system.
1.1. Pro: There are [examples](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-international-comparisons-2017) of several other western countries utilising the single-payer system with great success.
1.1.1. Pro: Single-payer systems [outperform](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-international-comparisons-2017) US systems internationally in terms of outcomes, efficiency, cost and equality of access.
1.1.2. Con: Since there are many sociological, [economic](https://www.indexmundi.com/factbook/compare/united-kingdom.united-states/economy), [legal](http://www.lawabsolute.com/recruitment-news/article/differences-between-us-and-uk-legal-systems), and [medical](https://www.aimseducation.edu/blog/us-vs-uk-allied-healthcare/) differences between the US and the UK. Thus, it is unreasonable to assume that implementing a UK-based system in the US would work at even the level it does in the UK.
1.1.3. Con: The Canadian single payer is likely a violation of the Bill of Rights because wait times - which for elective surgeries are on average [7 weeks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgeries-healthcare-canada-public-vs-private-system-bc-dr-brian-day-1.3977566) - are so high that it violates the right to access care.
1.1.4. Con: [Canada](https://www.globalresearch.ca/medicare-the-privatization-of-healthcare-in-canada/26935) is starting to privatize the healthcare system, which suggests the system doesn't work.
1.1.4.1. Con: In Canada, there are private hospitals but patient bills are [paid primarily](https://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/canada/) by the federal government.
1.1.5. Pro: When looked at at a cost/value ratio, the UK system is extremely effective.
1.1.5.1. Pro: The UK system costs less than [half as much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) as the US system.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: This would suggest that steps need to be taken to [reduce the cost of healthcare](https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/drug-prices) in the US. It’s not necessarily the single payer system that causes this.
1.1.5.2. Con: The UK has [private health insurance](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/health-insurance/) companies, so citizens buy health insurance to pay for further coverage.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Private insurance is available in the UK, but the premiums are [way lower](https://www.money.co.uk/health-insurance/how-does-health-insurance-work.htm) \(about one-tenth of the price of U.S. private insurance\) since most healthcare is funded publicly.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Most people do not purchase private health insurance \([about 10.6% in 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/private-medical-insurance-sales-surge-health-nhs)\).
1.1.5.3. Pro: [In the UK](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/Statistical-commentary-December-2017-11Jys.pdf), the NHS ER treats 85% of patients within 4 hours, with the target for treatment set at 95% of patients in 4 hours.
1.1.5.4. Con: The UK has one of the [worst](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-uk-now-has-one-of-the-worst-healthcare-systems-in-the-developed-world-according-to-oecd-report-a6721401.html) healthcare systems in the world, according to a report produced by the [OECD.](http://www.oecd.org/health/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm)
1.1.5.4.1. Con: That same report found that the United States [spends far more on health](http://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/Health-at-a-Glance-2017-Key-Findings-UNITED-STATES.pdf) than all other OECD countries, but lags behind in commensurate life expectancy gains.
1.2. Con: Any third party payer will reduce the number of available choices.
1.2.1. Pro: This attitudes of the electorate would determine what health care is available.
1.2.1.1. Pro: With only a single gatekeeper for health care, government policy can affect your treatment, such as prohibiting abortions, sex change treatments, procedures the government does not deem necessary, etc.
1.2.2. Pro: Medicare and Medicaid do not cover [acupuncture](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/coverage-all/is-acupuncture-covered-under-medicare), [homeopathy](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/south-australian-doctors-say-homeopathic-therapy-should-not-be-covered-by-medicare/news-story/49995c623145b7659d847b8670ceea33), and the use of herbs. Nor does it cover any experimental treatments.
1.2.2.1. Con: The former are not "experimetal treatments," they have no scientific basis and should be outside of medicine.
1.2.3. Pro: Third party payers by necessity include only what is most popular.
1.2.4. Con: It is unethical and immoral to deny basic healthcare to millions of Americans solely because it  may limit the variety of choices and low rates of others.
1.2.4.1. Con: Any ethical consideration must also take into account that nobody is entitled to the product of others' labor.
1.3. Pro: Single payer would simplify the healthcare system for everyone.
1.3.1. Con: People have diverse needs and values when it comes to healthcare, especially in the US, and pushing to simplify the system will create a one-size-fits-all approach which will put minority points of view at a disadvantage.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Existing Medicare satisfies the diverse needs and values of 44 million Americans [65 and older](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215395/). Removing the age minimum does nothing to change that.
1.3.2. Pro: Information on patients is shared more easily between systems.
1.3.3. Pro: There is less paperwork to be completed for complicated insurance policies, which could be difficult for people who are unwell or poorly educated to complete.
1.3.3.1. Con: If there is a single-payer system it will inevitably involve the government and if there is a single, consistent principle of big government it is the generation of paperwork.   Thus, there is no reason to assume that there would be less paperwork -- it would just be different paperwork to a different entity.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The current insurance market in the US has [numerous layers and middlemen](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/03/15/which-firms-profit-most-from-americas-health-care-system). Reducing this down to single-payer would reduce overall paperwork.
1.3.3.3. Pro: With a single payer, standardizing forms and processes provide opportunities to improve process efficiencies throughout the markets.
1.4. Pro: Saving human lives should not be an activity reliant on the incentive by profit.
1.4.1. Pro: Healthcare is a [basic human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_health), according the UN definitions, and therefore to make it contingent on employment or income is to stand between citizens and internationally-agreed basic human rights. This makes the US not only an outlier but also borderline criminal.
1.4.2. Pro: Natural incentive for socialized medicine is to lower costs through improved health outcomes; natural incentive for private medicine is increasing margins through repeat business.
1.4.2.1. Pro: This helps explain why [most prevention dollars](https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Universal-Health-Coverage-and-Health-Outcomes-OECD-G7-Health-Ministerial-2016.pdf) spent in the US are from individuals \(health products/memberships, etc.\) and corporations \(wellness programs\), not hospitals as there is no incentive to make people healthier - just to live longer.
1.4.3. Con: For a system to be sustainable, money needs to exchange hands in some form \(whether it's called profit, commission, grant or salary\).
1.4.4. Pro: Uncontrolled for profit in medical sector results in an abuse and increase in cost.
1.4.4.1. Pro: In [September 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli), Shkreli received widespread criticism when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 \(from US$13.5 to $750 per pill\).
1.4.4.1.1. Con: It is precisely because the profit was 'controlled' that allowed it to swing wildly. The company could get away with it because the insurance companies covered most of the high costs. It wouldn't cause the cost to consumer much. A third party payer arrangement allowed the high price and it would continue with Single payer \(exclusive third party\).
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Compared to other high-income countries with single-payer systems, the US [spends the most](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2017/oct/paying-prescription-drugs-around-world-why-us-outlier) per capita on prescription drugs.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: For example, US prices for the world's 20 top-selling medicines are, on average, [three times higher](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-u-s-pays-3-times-more-for-drugs/) than in Britain.
1.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Non-retail drugs, those generally physician-administered, are [1.8 times higher](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/259996/ComparisonUSInternationalPricesTopSpendingPartBDrugs.pdf) than in other countries and US prices are more likely to be the highest prices paid among them.
1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: International experience demonstrates that policies like [universal health coverage](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2017/oct/paying-prescription-drugs-around-world-why-us-outlier), insurance benefit design that restricts out-of-pocket spending, and certain price control strategies, like centralized price negotiations are effective.
1.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: The U.S. [spends more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) per-capita on healthcare than Canada or the UK.
1.4.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.1.
1.4.5. Con: Saving lives is important and should be more profitable than other things.
1.4.5.1. Con: By that logic, if saving a life \(or thousands\) is not profitable, then that person \(or people\) should be left to die.
1.4.5.2. Con: The current system does the opposite. It is [more profitable](https://www.justice.org/sites/default/files/file-uploads/InsuranceTactics.pdf) for an insurer to deny coverage than it is to provide coverage.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: In the US, government run and funded [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/) is more likely to [deny claims](https://www.healthcare-economist.com/2008/06/30/medicare-more-likely-to-deny-claims-than-commerical-health-insurers/) than commercial health insurers.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Con: Medicare is not a single-payer universal health system that does not in any case deny health treatment.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Research shows that private insurance companies engage in [unethical methods](https://www.justice.org/sites/default/files/file-uploads/InsuranceTactics.pdf) \(like denying, delaying and confusing costumers\) to improve profitability.
1.4.6. Pro: Healthcare systems that rely on profit incentives have harmful impacts.
1.4.6.1. Pro: America has [one of the highest](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/infant-mortality-u-s-compare-countries/#item-infant-mortality-higher-u-s-comparable-countries) infant mortality rates among first world countries, often because individuals who are uninsured do not get the proper checkups.
1.5. Con: It contributes to the centralization of power and decision making. It puts everyone at risk if the people in charge are evil or incompetent.
1.5.1. Con: Single payer doesn't necessarily consolidate power. Bureaucracy [limits the power](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0733-558X\(2012\)0000034006/full/html) of individuals by definition, and a healthcare bureaucracy could be designed to mitigate these risks.
1.5.2. Con: Power is already consolidated in the hands of the insurance companies, who can be just as evil and incompetent.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Insurance companies have an inherent conflict of interest: the less they reimburse, the higher their profits.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Research point out that the healthcare insurer market is more resembling to an oligopoly: large for profit companies are more likely to exercise market power via price increases than are comparable non for profit insurers. [\(Dafny and Ramanarayanan, p. 28\)](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/19_Dafny_Does%20it%20Matter%20if%20Your%20Health%20Insurer%20if%20For-Profit_Forthcoming_6ad829c1-3a64-4664-a13a-db3532dd8fac.pdf).
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Pricing actions by large insurers have a ripple effect on rivals’ prices, further solidifying the evidence of oligopolistic conduct in many local insurance markets.
1.5.3. Pro: In a true single-payer model, financing and decision making power of health care systems are [highly centralized](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2019/apr/considering-single-payer-proposals-lessons-from-abroad).
1.6. Pro: Single-payer health systems are more cost-effective.
1.6.1. Pro: With one payer, you get less bureaucratic overhead, making it cheaper and easier to use.
1.6.1.1. Con: When someone under a private system chooses and pays for their own healthcare, the only bureaucratic overhead is that individual person. It is unclear how adding a layer of bureaucratic overhead over the public market would reduce bureaucratic overhead.
1.6.2. Con: Cost effectiveness is far less important than individual freedom in [choosing your own](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/health/alfie-evans-appeal-bn/index.html) healthcare options and a focus on cost efficiency can trample rights.
1.6.3. Con: Healthcare is fundamentally a [risk venture](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20181218.956406/full/). For profit insurers seek to take on the lowest risk patients, which leaves high risk patients the public system. Because they are high risk, they will, on average, cost the system, placing the financial burden on the tax payer.
1.6.4. Pro: Single payer systems offer the advantage of bargaining power with drug providers and other suppliers.
1.6.4.1. Con: Congress has prohibited Medicare and Medicaid from using their buying power to [negotiate lower prices](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2018/08/10/why-medicare-cant-get-the-lowest-drug-prices/#724f5897302b).
1.6.5. Con: Using monopolistic power to reduce costs is shortsighted and will lead to [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss).
1.6.5.1. Pro: In the context of healthcare, this means [pushing down](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/explainer/hospitals-and-monopolies/) salaries for doctors, which reduces the incentive for people to work as doctors, which leads to a shortage.
1.6.5.2. Pro: It can also mean pushing down prices for drugs, which reduces the incentive to invest in research and development of new drugs, which means missed opportunities to cure other illnesses.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.2.
1.6.7. Pro: A single-payer system would [reduce the number of bankruptcies](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/single-payer-system-would-reduce-us-health-care-costs/2012-11) due to medical bills. This would mean providers would always be paid regardless of the patient's financial status.
1.6.8. Pro: Eliminating the incentive to raise prices for profit will reduce costs.
1.6.8.1. Pro: A study by the OECD [found that](http://healthoverprofit.org/2017/03/01/the-high-cost-of-private-profit-in-health-care/) the overhead cost of delivering care through Medicare was 3% while the overhead costs of delivering care through a for-profit HMO was 19%.
1.6.8.2. Con: The overhead cost of administrating medicare is not lower when one takes into account the implicit costs that are not registered as accounting costs. Private firms must pay for these services through increased prices.
1.6.9. Con: Moving to a single-payer system would negatively affect international healthcare systems, as the US healthcare market essentially [subsidizes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterubel/2014/04/18/the-real-health-care-subsidy-problem/#46df36f32881) much of the rest of the world's access to new products and new procedures.
1.6.9.1. Con: These drugs/procedures etc are not exported for free - the companies still charge other countries for products and development costs, and the US healthcare system transitioning to single payer status would not change this.
1.6.9.2. Con: New health related products and procedures do not necessarily lead to better outcomes nor are they inherently [less expensive](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/fundamentals/financial-issues-in-health-care/causes-of-high-health-care-costs).
1.7. Pro: Single-payer is the most compassionate solution for the US.
1.7.1. Pro: It would provide equal access to the same health care regardless of level of income.
1.7.1.1. Con: What happens in other countries with one payer systems is the “normal” people have to use the under funded system, while the wealthy will pay out of pocket for better healthcare.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Single-payer or tax-funded healthcare systems worldwide are not "all under-funded".
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: In such systems, there are public \(normal\) and premium \(out of pocket payment\) options [available](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775339519/heres-how-warren-finds-20-5-trillion-to-pay-for-medicare-for-all).
1.7.1.1.3. Pro: This also means the best doctors will gravitate towards the [wealthy](https://www.thirdway.org/memo/can-you-keep-your-doctor-under-single-payer).
1.7.1.1.3.1. Con: The argument that "the best doctors will gravitate towards the wealthy" is itself an argument for narrowing the gap between least coverage and most coverage by providing a minimum national standard of healthcare that can afford to higher the so called "best" doctors.
1.7.1.1.3.2. Con: The "best doctors" are even more likely to gravitate towards the wealthy inside a system that ONLY affords the wealthy access to better doctors.
1.7.1.2. Pro: People would not have to make choices on health care plan options as a gamble on how sick you might get that year
1.7.1.3. Con: A single-payer healthcare system would lead to an increase in taxes and would therefore damage the economy.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Tax would replace insurance payments.
1.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: When earnings about $100,000/year taxes, the cost of health care are a higher percentage of income in USA then in Canada with single-payer health care.
1.7.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: In the US, on an earning of $100,000, individuals pay 32% tax + insurance payments. In [Canada](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes), on the same income, only a 28% tax is applicable without the need to pay for health care. Health care is almost free in Canada and in USA it costs on average 440+ month + any co pay/fees that needs to be paid.
1.7.1.3.2. Con: Other countries have shown that a single payer system is viable without a detrimental effect on the overall economy.
1.7.1.3.2.1. Pro: [European countries](https://medium.com/\@kentkroeger3/why-can-european-countries-afford-universal-health-care-and-the-u-s-cant-966da2358e20) have shown that a universal health care is affordable.
1.7.1.3.3. Pro: It is estimated that a single-payer system could cost an additional $32 trillion, requiring a [20% tax increase](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/medicare-for-all-higher-taxes-fewer-choices-longer-lines) in the US.
1.7.1.3.4. Pro: A single-payer health care system eliminates all private insurance and place all medical care in the hands of the federal government. To raise money for this expenditure, the government has to [increase taxes](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/medicare-for-all-higher-taxes-fewer-choices-longer-lines).
1.7.1.3.5. Con: There would likely be demonstrable decrease to annual individual healthcare costs that are more significant than the tax increase, leading to a net gain.
1.7.1.3.6. Con: Reduction of ill people leads to a healthier and more productive population.
1.7.1.4. Con: Cost effective drugs and treatments may not be available through the system. It only [extends to life extending drugs](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/15/trump-criticize-uk-single-payer-health-care-column/1419339001/), not life saving drugs.
1.7.1.5. Pro: "[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness)" is meaningless for those who cannot afford their own health care.
1.7.1.6. Pro: [Access to healthcare](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Access-to-Health-Services) has a direct and significant effect on quality and [longevity of life](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-contribution-of-public-health-and-improved-social-conditions-to-increased-life-expectancy-an-analysis-of-public-awareness-2161-0711-4-311.php?aid=35861). Every American citizen should have this vitally important support.
1.7.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.7.2. Pro: A single-payer system results in lower stress levels, which produces dramatic and profound societal bounty.
1.7.2.1. Con: Single payer is one among many possible methods of paying for \(allocating\) healthcare resources. The actual provision of healthcare \(and the consequences therof\) probably have more bearing on people's mental state than the method of payment.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.
1.9. Con: A single-payer healthcare system would lead to a worse healthcare service.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.9.2. Con: Currently, health care in USA is [worse](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2019/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries) than many other systems in place in terms of quality.
1.9.3. Pro: The US is the primary source of advancements in medical [research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/03/23/the-most-innovative-countries-in-biology-and-medicine/#7cc42dcf1a71) and technology for the world. This will be greatly diminished if the US removes commercial incentives.
1.9.3.1. Con: A single-payer system [does not remove](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20171020.731330/full/) economic incentives. The government can and should reward innovation by choosing the most cost-effective providers.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: No government has ever been cost effective with money. That's why [most countries run deficits](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Economy/Budget-surplus/%2B-or-deficit/--#-amount).
1.9.3.2. Con: A public healthcare system could subsidize medical research since it would be in the interest of taxpayers.
1.9.3.3. Con: Research drives by profit does not adequately reflect the allocation of resources where it is needed the most.
1.9.3.3.1. Pro: Research made in the context of profit tends to have an allocation of resources that "does not reflect the burden of [disease](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/4233/u.s.-slipping-as-global-leader-in-medical-research.aspx) on society". So diseases that represent more than 80% of US deaths receive less than half of the funding.
1.9.3.3.1.1. Pro: The money spent by the pharmaceutical industry on finding treatments for rare diseases is also [high](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-pharmaceutical-companies-profiting-rare-diseases.html), driven primarily by the lower barriers to market set forth in the [Orphan Drug Act of 1983](https://www.fda.gov/industry/designating-orphan-product-drugs-and-biological-products/orphan-drug-act-relevant-excerpts).
1.9.4. Con: Many US citizens currently have [very little access](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235885/) to basic health care. For them, a single-payer healthcare system would definitely provide a better service, not worse.
1.9.5. Con: Under a single-payer system, wealthy US citizens would still be able to purchase private market healthcare services beyond basic care, based on market demand.
1.9.5.1. Con: Less wealthy groups will want higher and higher levels of care based on what is available. It is too difficult to establish what basic care is.
1.9.6. Pro: The only way to keep costs down in a system absent of competition is to cut service.
1.9.6.1. Con: Single payer systems look for ways to reduce cost of service resulting in care that has better outcomes. Insurance based health care either looks for lower costs by denying care or increasing prices to maximize profit with the cost of peoples health
1.9.6.2. Con: There are many ways to keep costs down in a public healthcare system, such as providing preventative care and education to the public.
1.9.6.3. Con: The large buying power of a public health system reduces [drug prices](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.20.5.43).
1.9.7. Con: The government is obligated to ensure a single-payer system includes checks that ensure a minimum required level of care is provided. To do less would incur the wrath of their constituents, in the next election.
1.9.8. Pro: Without prices generated by some sort of [market mechanism](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/basic-economics-concepts-macro/market-equilibrium-disequilibrium-and-changes-in-equilibrium/a/lesson-summary-market-equilibrium-disequilibrium-and-changes-in-equilibrium), it is not possible to determine real demand and efficiently match supply with that demand.
1.9.8.1. Con: The current market mechanism can provide data, which could be a starting point for setting up a single payer system.
1.9.8.1.1. Con: This assumes that the pattern of demand is static, which would require no demographic, technological, preferential or other changes; as well as assuming that there will be no external economic shocks, either positive or negative. This assumption is unlikely to bear out.
1.9.8.2. Con: [Service audit and quality improvement projects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673151/) would ensure that there is no unmatched need or oversupply once the system has been set up.
1.9.8.2.1. Con: Current single-payer systems attempt to do this, and fail \(vide the NHS, and the problem of people dying in hallways\). This is likely because the system is too complex for a central planner to integrate information as efficiently as a price system does.
1.9.9. Con: A public and private system competing with each other gives people choices, and pressures both systems to provide quality care at reasonable prices.
