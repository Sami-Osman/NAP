Discussion Name: Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?

1. The United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union.
1.1. Con: Democracy in the EU is seriously impaired.
1.1.1. Pro: The directly appointed representatives in the European Parliament are not the source of legislation. They can [only approve or reject proposals](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers), but not make them.
1.1.1.1. Con: The directly elected members of parliament in Westminster are not the source of legislation either. it is not the job of the directly appointed members to initiate legislation in most systems; it is their job to amend, improve or reject, and the EU parliament has that power.
1.1.2. Pro: The president of the Commission is not directly elected, but is elected by the leaders of each government and with no veto. This is too remote from the population.
1.1.2.1. Con: The prime mister of the UK is not directly elected either, but appointed by the the largest party in parliament with no veto. Yet this mechanism is usually not interpreted as a sign of a democratic deficit in the UK.
1.1.2.2. Con: The European Commission is the EU's civil service, and the President of the Commission is its head. In the UK, the head of the civil service \(cabinet secretary\) is also not elected, but appointed by the Prime Minister. So the EU works in this respect very similar to the UK \(and many other member governments\).
1.1.2.3. Con: The proposition of the European Council must be approved by the European Parliament, a democratically elected body that represents the interests of the European People.
1.1.3. Con: Democracy in [many places](https://www.politico.eu/article/cambridge-analytica-chris-wylie-brexit-trump-britain-data-protection-privacy-facebook/) is seriously impaired.
1.1.4. Con: The UK itself isn't overtly democratic either.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The UK has an unelected [House of Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/lords/).
1.1.4.2. Pro: The UK remains [a monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom).
1.1.5. Con: The UK is currently governed by a Conservative government that only received support from [29.1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election) of eligible voters at the last General Election and their level of popular support has continued to fall in [recent elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_local_elections). Democracy is no worse impaired in the EU than it is in the UK.
1.1.6. Con: EU legislation cannot pass without the approval of the democratically elected European Parliament, and at least majority approval by the Council of Ministers \(Ministers of the democratically elected governments of member states\).
1.1.6.1. Pro: Although the system is not as democratic as a nation state, it is a compromise which allows Europeans, European governments and the EU itself to find compromise and effectively write and pass legislation that is in the interest of all parties.
1.1.7. Con: The EU's democracy is not impaired, rather it is different. One could argue that EU democracy does a better job at representing the population than many national democratic systems.
1.1.7.1. Pro: The fact that members of the Commission are proposed by member states and not chosen by parliament encourage MEPs to hold the Commission to account, exercising better legislative oversight than most parliaments.
1.1.7.2. Pro: The European Commission is the only institution with the right of initiative, but they have a [strict consultation procedure](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law_en) which ensures citizens, experts, NGOs and businesses are heard.
1.1.7.3. Pro: The European Unions democratic structures ensure people on every level have a say: The Commission represents the Union itself, the Council represents member states, The Council of Regions represents regions, the Economic & Social Committee represents business, trade unions, religion and NGOs, the European Parliament represents the people as a whole.
1.2. Pro: The citizens of the United Kingdom living abroad will be put into a complicated situation when they lose their work eligibility. This could potentially put thousands of individuals out of work and scrambling for new employment.
1.3. Con: A majority of the UK's voters supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum.
1.3.1. Con: The UK is not leaving the EU because of the referendum but because Parliament voted to enact Article 50. This has been [made clear](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38720320) by the Supreme Court.
1.3.2. Con: The people are not well informed enough to make such a decision - this choice should be left up to elected officials.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The UK is a parliamentary democracy, not a direct one. The people elect representatives to carry on the business of government on their behalf.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The Conservative party won an election with the promise of a referendum in their manifesto.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The [Conservative manifesto](https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto2015) led with Strong Leadership / a Clear Economic Plan / a Brighter More Secure Future. Not everything in a manifesto is delivered.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: The vast majority of the elected representatives voted to have the referendum.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: A majority of elected representatives [voted to leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38833883) the EU in the withdrawal bill.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The role of our elected MPs is to think and act carefully in choosing the best course for the country.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Enacting a simple majority vote of the people who disagree with Parliament on this issue weakens Parliament.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Decisions with wide-ranging and long-lasting effects, such as constitutional revisions, usually require not only a simple majority but a supermajority.
1.3.2.4. Con: It's implicit in a referendum that voters will be less informed than experts. This does not delegitamise the result.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: There is a difference between being "less informed" than experts and being completely uninformed or misinformed. Briton's [understanding and perception](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/perils-perception-and-eu) of the EU is flawed to a point which makes a rational decision impossible.
1.3.2.4.2. Con: It is to be expected that voters will generally not be experts on complex political issues, but the 2016 referendum packaged up a huge bundle of such issues and required a blunt yes/no answer to the question of EU membership. There is nothing wrong with non-experts having the vote, but the referendum campaigns were actively misleading and made claims that were known to be false at the time they were made. This is a deeper failing than lack of expertise.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Their [majority view](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946) over a long period of time has been that membership of the EU is in our interests.
1.3.2.6. Con: If only the most informed people ought to make a decision, then there is little justification for democracy itself.
1.3.2.6.1. Con: That is precisely the nature of representative democracy. The "job" of voting on stuff is effectively outsourced to representatives who are themselves accountable to the electorate.
1.3.2.7. Con: Even if the people are considered uninformed, it is still democratically sound to ask for their input in a decision that parliament has to make.
1.3.2.7.1. Con: The referendum was advisory; the responsibility still lies with the elected officials.
1.3.3. Con: A [4% margin](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-final-result-leave-campaign-secures-official-lead-a7099296.html) should not be viewed as a sufficient mandate to fundamentally alter the United Kingdom's relationship with its closest neighbours.
1.3.3.1. Con: The results of previous UK referenda on constitutional issues with smaller margins of victory have been accepted.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: For example, the result of the [Welsh Devolution Referendum 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_devolution_referendum,_1997) was accepted with 50.3% of votes supporting the Government's proposal.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: As 51.9% of votes supporting the proposal to leave the EU exceeds this benchmark, there is sufficient mandate for British Exit from the EU based on past precedent.
1.3.3.2. Pro: [More than a quarter](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/what-if-everyone-had-voted-in-the-eu-referendum/) of the electorate didn't vote.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: The electorate that did not vote were entitled to vote but did not so. It should be assumed that those who did not vote chose to abstain rather than assume they would have voted one way or another if forced to vote.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: UK citizens oversees, many of them in Europe, were not considered eligible to vote.
1.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.3.4. Con: The choice of the English people is against the choice of the people of [Scotland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36599102) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-36614443).
1.3.4.1. Con: The referendum reflects all the UK, not separated countries; there is no valid reason to subdivide the result based on the UK's member countries.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The same argument could be used to justify an EU referendum to override UK’s result.
1.3.5. Pro: Ignoring the referendum reduces the democratic legitimacy of the UK political process.
1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.3.5.2. Pro: If the referendum is ignored the will of the people is thwarted.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: The will of the people is to have their elected representatives make decisions for them.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Con: When Parliament put the decision to the people via a referendum, and the way in which they have continued to act they have changed their role from a representative to a delegate.
1.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con: It is not for parliament to change their role.
1.3.5.3. Con: The referendum can hardly be ignored, the government may decide not to progress along those advisory lines, but it's been fairly prominently discussed.
1.3.5.4. Con: There is no suggestion that the referendum should be ignored: it needs to be given full and proper consideration. That doesn't necessarily mean leaving the EU, though.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: Representatives should be advised \(but not driven\) by the result of the referendum, there are many other matters they must also consider.
1.3.5.4.2. Pro: Democracy does not impose the will of the majority, but looks for a dialogue with the minorities to achieve a compromise.
1.3.5.4.3. Con: The Ruling Party's [manifesto](https://www.bond.org.uk/data/files/Blog/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf) pledged to respect the result of the referendum \(p. 73\). Supposedly, this refers to an intention to implement the popular preference.
1.3.5.4.3.1. Con: The ruling party's manifesto also pledged "strong leadership, a clear economic plan and a brighter more secure future", which its conceivable some people voted for too. Since that is diametrically opposed to the farcical situation we have now, it's fair to say that the manifesto assumed remain would win.
1.3.5.4.3.2. Con: The commitment to the referendum is on page 73 of an 81 page manifesto and two of the pages after it are pictures of children and one is big Dave Cameron himself. Its fair to say it was not a central plank of the manifesto and it is impossible to determine how much influence it had in people's voting choices.
1.3.5.4.3.2.1. Con: You could argue that the conservatives only went into power due to the manifesto pledge as they attracted many votes that would of gone to UKIP and other parties otherwise. Due to what for those voters was a main pledge. for example: [2015 Party polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015)
1.3.5.4.3.2.1.1. Con: To argue that would be to argue that the Conservatives at the time, who clearly never intended the result to go for leave, deceived those people into voting for them, only to have that spectacularly backfire on them.
1.3.5.4.3.2.1.2. Con: It is impossible to second-guess the motivations for voting on a manifesto that included a large number of promises, some of them contradictory.
1.3.5.4.3.2.1.3. Pro: That argument would suggest that the Conservatives took a cynical gamble to scoop up ukip votes in a tight election by promising something they never intended to see through and that, without such a dishonest and reckless move, they would have not secured a majority and there would have been a coalition or hung parliament.
1.3.5.4.3.2.2. Con: The UK's relations with the EU were [one of the most prominent topics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/377483/most-important-election-2015-issues-great-britiain-uk/) during the run-up to the election. This makes it reasonable to believe that the parties' positions on the issue and the referendum were important.
1.3.5.4.3.3. Con: The [telegraph's summary](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11534619/manifesto-policies-summary.html) of the key pledges in the Conservative manifesto didn't mention the referendum at all.
1.3.5.5. Con: The referendum's legal status was only [meant to be advisory](https://fullfact.org/europe/was-eu-referendum-advisory/).
1.3.5.5.1. Con: The [Leaflet published by the government](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160813202542/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk) made it quite clear "This is a once in a lifetime decision" and "This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide."
1.3.5.5.1.1. Con: The government promised things that were outside of its [direct power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Miller#Brexit_legal_challenge) to deliver.
1.3.5.5.2. Con: "Advisory" means that the government does not have to comply. But it still ought to enact the will of the people.
1.3.5.5.3. Pro: The Conservative government's claim to enact any majority decision was just that, a political claim, and not legally binding.
1.3.5.5.3.1. Con: If the government did not act upon the vote then they would be viewed as disingenuous.
1.3.5.5.4. Con: While advisory, the government would have faced heavy backlash if they didn't follow suit.
1.3.5.5.4.1. Con: It is unclear what backlash there would be.
1.3.5.5.4.2. Pro: Regardless of the scenario, for example a [breakdown of negotiations](https://www.politico.eu/article/poll-british-public-want-second-referendum-if-brexit-talks-break-down-labour-party-jeremy-corbyn/) between the EU and the UK or [successful negotiations](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/when-the-uk-governments-negotiations-over-the-terms-of-britains-exit-from-the-eu-are-complete-would-you-support-or-oppose-holding-a-peoples-vote-a-referendum-asking-the-public-their-view-2/) of a Brexit deal, about half the British people support the idea of a second referendum. This indicates a preference for a public decision about what to do next over a decision made by politicians.
1.3.5.5.5. Pro: Parliament must act in the national interest. If the advice of voters turns out to be damaging, government should explain that best endeauvors have failed to produce an acceptable outcome and change course.
1.3.5.5.6. Con: The fact the parliament passed the article 50 bill thus mandates the decision.
1.3.6. Con: The Brexit referendum was of questionable legitimacy.
1.3.6.1. Pro: The result of the referendum was unclear, given that there are at least three ["Leave" options](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/the-eu/what-are-the-other-brexit-options/) that are each antithetical to the other Leave factions.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Since the referendum, revelations have emerged around [the role of Cambridge Analytica and the influence of Facebook](https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/22/eu-referendum-result-may-not-legitimate-due-facebook-scandal-warns-mep-7407581/) in the vote, which puts the result in doubt.
1.3.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.3.6.4. Pro: There are [good reasons](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/heres-what-we-know-about-alleged-russian-involvement-in-brexit) [to believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum) that the Brexit vote was manipulated by Russian influences. It shouldn't be the foundation for England leaving the EU.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: Manipulating the Brexit vote would have served the Russian goal of separating the UK from Europe, as it was outlined by Alexander Dugin in his book [Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics).
1.3.6.4.2. Con: Research from Oxford University [has shown](https://blogs.oii.ox.ac.uk/politicalbots/publishing/in-the-news/russian-tweets-on-brexit-were-minimal-study-shows/) that there was no significant Twitter activity from Russia with an eye on the 2016 referendum.
1.3.6.4.2.1. Con: Social media is not the only way that a vote could be meddled with.
1.3.6.5. Pro: Qualified EU nationals resident in the UK were not allowed to vote. The referendum result is, therefore, very likely not representative of the opinion of the majority of the UK adult population, culturally and economically integrated in the UK at the same level of British citizens.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: Arbitrarily speculating the opinions of those ineligible to vote risks undermining the registered opinions of those eligible to vote. Determining who is actually eligible and who is ineligible is a different matter altogether, but once decided should be respected.
1.3.6.5.2. Con: If eligible EU nationals wanted to vote in the referendum, they should have acquired British citizenship, as they were entitled to.
1.3.6.5.2.1. Con: It takes more than a year to acquire British citizenship \(as one has to hold a certificate of residency, which EU citizens otherwise would not require, for at least 12 months\), however there were less than 12 months between the passing of the European Union Referendum Act 2015 and the voter registration deadline for the 2016 referendum. Therefore eligible EU nationals who have already been in the UK for at least 5 years had no chance to acquire British citizenship in time for the referendum.
1.3.6.5.2.2. Con: There are a number of barriers for EU nationals to become British citizens, one of them, being that [the cost](https://www.freemovement.org.uk/briefing-what-are-the-barriers-to-british-citizenship-for-eu-nationals/) of an application for British nationality is out of reach for many EU nationals.
1.3.6.5.3. Con: Foreign nationals were not allowed to vote in the referendum just as they cannot in a general election, which is entirely appropriate. This is a normal practice in democracies.
1.3.6.6. Con: The referendum had an high turnout of 72%. This is significantly higher than at all [general elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_general_elections) since the 1990s and other [UK-wide referenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_the_United_Kingdom#National_referendums).
1.3.6.6.1. Con: The European Union Referendum Act 2015 did not state any requirement for turnout or majority for the result to be significant. It made no provisions to bind any government to do anything with the result. The Act treated the referendum as just an advisory opinion poll. The result showed that the electorate is pretty evenly split on the issue \(within 2%\). Many democracies require significant supermajorities for such constitutional changes as stripping fundamental rights from most residents.
1.3.6.6.2. Con: There is no significance behind the relative size of this vote in relation to others, as it is comparing different kinds of election.
1.3.6.6.2.1. Pro: Unlike at a general election, there were only two choices, which may have affected voter turnout.
1.3.6.6.3. Con: The share of voters does not legitimize or delegitimize something.
1.3.6.6.4. Con: The high turnout did not lead to a significant majority \(and therefore a clear mandate\).
1.3.6.7. Pro: At the time of the referendum, it was not clear what form a Brexit would actually take and there was no clear understanding on either side about which promises would be deliverable.
1.3.6.7.1. Con: The UK can always leave the EU with a hard, no-deal Brexit.
1.3.6.8. Pro: Victory for the Leave campaign was only achieved because of misleading statements and undeliverable promises that were disingenuous.
1.3.6.8.1. Pro: For instance, the campaign claimed that "£350m/week would be saved through Brexit, which could be funnelled to the NHS. The Leave campaign only [admitted that this was false](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary), once the vote had been won.
1.3.6.8.2. Pro: For instance, the leave campaign argued that "[Turkey](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vince-cable-vote-leave-turks-live-village-80-million-liberal-democrat-leader-church-halls-a7835891.html) is imminently joining the EU", leading to further immigration into Britain, which was an unfounded claim.
1.3.6.8.3. Pro: Leave campaigners advocated [membership of the Single Market,](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/open-britain-video-single-market-nigel-farage-anna-soubry_uk_582ce0a0e4b09025ba310fce) as part of the Brexit deal, which is now clearly in question.
1.3.6.8.4. Con: By this standard, each and every election and referendum would be invalid as lies and falsehoods are an inevitable part of politics.
1.3.6.8.4.1. Con: Outright lying is not inevitable; politicians and campaigners can and should be held to a higher standard.
1.3.6.8.4.2. Con: The [scale and tactical approach to misrepresenting facts](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/security-weaponization-misinformation/) and telling blatent lies has increased in recent years. "Fake News" is certainly not a new idea but misinformation has been [weaponised](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjJvum9pLTfAhXoyYUKHRE0AX8QzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Fbriefing%2F2018%2F02%2F22%2Frussian-disinformation-distorts-american-and-european-democracy&psig=AOvVaw1X1gtbr2UNyW-6t7NWdjz4&ust=1545597225130797) via new media.
1.3.6.8.5. Con: Elections are not nullified by a misleading campaign. Part of a campaign is manufacturing promises which may or may not be realisable. The elector must decide which party makes the most compelling argument and is responsible of their choice
1.3.6.8.6. Pro: Key campaign promises were [lies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-result-nigel-farage-nhs-pledge-disowns-350-million-pounds-a7099906.html)
1.3.6.8.7. Con: The Remain campaign also made claims that turned out to be untrue or undeliverable.
1.3.6.8.7.1. Pro: For instance, George Osborne insisted that there would be an "[emergency budget](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu)" if Leave won, which was never fulfilled.
1.3.6.8.7.1.1. Con: Philip Hammond, the current chancellor, continues to reiterate Osbornes warnings in 2018 following the announcement of May's deal that an [emergency budget](https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/3065329/budget-2018-chancellor-warns-of-emergency-budget-in-no-deal-brexit-scenario) will probably be required if we the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
1.3.6.8.7.2. Con: Misleading statements and undeliverable statements on the remain side don't invalidate the argument that the leave side won because of misleading statements and undeliverable statements.
1.3.6.9. Pro: Vote Leave [broke the law](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/media-statement-vote-leave).
1.3.6.9.1. Con: When a campaign group breaks the law, it does not invalidate the result of the referendum.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.6.
1.3.8. Con: [Polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#Post–referendum_polling) now suggests public opinion has changed.
1.3.8.1. Con: Polls have been consistently incorrect for a number of years and have lost credibility [www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40123231)
1.3.8.2. Pro: The will of the people fluctuates, sometimes they rather leave and sometimes they rather stay. Future generations did not have a vote.
1.3.8.3. Con: Upon closer inspection of [post-referendum polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#Post%E2%80%93referendum_polling), the lead fluctuates a lot and mostly hovers between a 1 and 5% lead for wrong or pro-remain. [Pre-referendum polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#2016) had similar pro-remain margins which suggests that poll audiences are on average slightly skewed in favour of remain when compared with real votes.
1.3.9. Con: -> See 1.3.6.8.
1.3.10. Con: -> See 1.3.5.5.
1.3.11. Con: The party that ran on the basis of granting the EU Referendum lost its majority in the following general election.
1.3.11.1. Con: Labour, which equally ran on the promise of enacting the referendum result, gained seats in the same election. The election result can therefore not be interpreted as a vote against Brexit.
1.3.11.1.1. Pro: The election was to establish who runs the government and as such should not be looked at as endorsing or undermining a completely different vote.
1.3.11.2. Con: The loss of a parliamentary majority in an election must be attributable to the whole of the party manifesto, not just to the former stance on an event that has already happened.
1.3.11.2.1. Con: It is highly likely that voters do not read manifestos.
1.3.11.3. Pro: The Conservative election campaign made great play of positioning Theresa May as the best leader to deliver Brexit and was clear that the party supported Brexit, so the result can legitimately be seen as significantly, if not wholly, expressive of the electorate's view of Brexit.
1.4. Con: Considering the time, money and energy spent by all sides on the UK's departure, staying in the EU seems inappropriate.
1.4.1. Con: The more time, money and energy expended on this issue, the clearer it becomes that revoking article 50 is the only way to prevent further unnecessary expenditure of time, money and energy on an ever larger scale.
1.4.2. Con: It is utter madness to pursue a damaging path purely to justify a series of terrible and irresponsible, politically-driven decisions that have led to fantastic wastes of time, money and effort.
1.5. Pro: Membership of the EU ensures freedom of movement between all the member states.
1.5.1. Pro: By closing the borders we are also restricting British youth's opportunities of working and studying abroad, therefore, reducing the capacity for innovation and ultimately reducing the country's competitiveness.
1.5.2. Con: Leaving the EU allows Britain to be able to better control immigration flows.
1.5.2.1. Con: Data collected and summarised by the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf) suggests that immigration is in most cases positive for the economy. Imposing severe restrictions on immigration is equivalent to restricting economic benefit.
1.5.2.2. Pro: It is harder for someone from outside the EU to migrate to the UK. It would be fairer if migrants from all countries had to go through the same immigration process.
1.5.2.3. Con: Since the UK has left the European Union, Cooperation to prevent channel crossings has slowed, and the UK can no longer return people who illegally entered the UK to Europe. Leaving the EU has distinctly reduced the UKs ability to control immigration.
1.5.2.4. Con: The UK, with an [ageing population](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/july2017) and [fertility rates](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates) stalling, will be in desperate need of migrant labour to support its economy over the next 20-50 years.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: It is not necessary for the UK to remain in the EU in order to import migrant labour.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: Importing migrant labour from outside a common block is more expensive and time consuming.
1.5.2.5. Pro: EU citizens create more demand for service from the NHS.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: It is not fair that EU nationals have the same access to the NHS as British citizens who have paid UK taxes all of their lives. This is 'jumping the queue' as they have only paid UK taxes for a few years.
1.5.2.5.1.1. Con: Most EU migrants to the UK arrive there in their twenties, at an age when health care requirements are minimal. In contrast, most UK migrants to Spain arrive there after retirement in their sixties, at an age when they start becoming a significant burden to the local healthcare system after not having paid taxes in Spain for many years.
1.5.2.5.1.2. Con: Plenty of UK nationals have not 'paid taxes all of their lives' - the youth, long term / permanently unemployed, many disabled individuals, and severely ill people - and yet it is not socially acceptable to deny NHS treatment to these groups.
1.5.2.5.1.3. Con: This doesn't mean EU nationals have not contributed and are 'jumping the queue'. EU nationals have paid tax in their home country, and because UK nationals who move to another EU country would benefit from their health system, it's a fair exchange.
1.5.2.5.1.4. Con: Part of the point of the NHS is that resources are allocated on the basis of need, not of contribution. If you need treatment, you get it, regardless of how much you have contributed.
1.5.2.5.1.5. Con: The NHS claims for the care an EU citizen receives from the member state via [European Health Insurance Card \(EHIC\)](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/107/10708.htm).
1.5.2.5.2. Con: EU citizens also staff the NHS, with [over 10% EU staff](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7783) in London.
1.5.2.5.3. Con: The European Health Insurance Card scheme means that UK citizens can receive healthcare in all participating nations, thus reducing any burden on the NHS of UK citizens who require healthcare while living or travelling in Europe.
1.5.2.5.4. Con: EU citizens are, on average, [net fiscal contributors](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-workers-uk-tax-treasury-brexit-migrants-british-citizens-a8542506.html) to the UK government as a whole. The average UK citizen is, by contrast, a net drain on the fiscal system.
1.5.2.6. Con: The UK has ways and means to control migration as a member of the EU that it [hasn't made use of](https://brexit853.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/powers-that-the-uk-has-failed-to-use-to-control-eu-freedom-of-movement-directive/) so far.
1.5.3. Pro: Students from the UK are able to study in other EU countries through the [Erasmus](https://www.erasmusplus.org.uk/) programme
1.5.3.1. Con: Non EU countries [can participate](https://www.erasmusplus.org.uk/participating-countries) in this program. At the moment they are: the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Turkey and Serbia.
1.5.4. Con: Free movement has not only positive implications. Criminals from poorer parts of the EU see wealthier countries of the union as a better place for their activities. Hence the UK experiences a [rapidly increase of the EU nationals in its prisons](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/659620/Britain-prison-huge-rise-EU-convicts-150million-taxpayer).
1.5.4.1. Con: The article makes intentionally misleading claims. During approximately the same period, the population of EU-born foreigners living in the UK rose by [225%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-born_population_of_the_United_Kingdom#Countries_of_origin) \(12.7 million to 28.7 million\), so it is unsurprising that the prison population rose by 240%.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: The Lithuanian born UK population increased by over [2500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-born_population_of_the_United_Kingdom#Countries_of_origin)%, while the prison population rose by only 1000%.
1.6. Pro: Leaving the EU could threaten relations between UK countries.
1.6.1. Con: There is long been a push for a united Ireland and Scottish Independence. Brexit will be exploited by these camps but they won't go away if the UK remains part of the EU.
1.6.2. Pro: If the UK leaves the EU then a border with Ireland would be reintroduced.
1.6.2.1. Con: Every authority has pledged to not introduce a hard border. The UK government, Irish government and the EU are unanimous in this. Other parties may require one by complaining to the WTO but who would risk peace.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: These pledges should be seen critically. [Various British politicians](https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-politicians-4336217-Dec2018/), among them the [Secretary of State for Northern Ireland](https://www.theweek.co.uk/96326/northern-ireland-secretary-karen-bradley-admits-ignorance-of-northern-ireland-politics), have showcased a profound lack of knowledge about the political situation.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: David Cameron was willing to risk the peace by embarking on a brexit referendum with no clear plan of how th manage the situation in the event of a leave vote.
1.6.2.2. Con: A border with Ireland is not a prerequisite for departure from the EU. Brexit does not guarantee that a hard border will be restored.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: There is no current acceptable plan to avoid a hard border.
1.6.2.2.2. Con: As long as the UK leaves the single market and abandons free movement, which the [UK government](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/02/theresa-may-says-brexit-will-reduce-uk-access-to-single-market) has stated it intends on doing, then a hard border will be required.
1.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Assuming “a need” for a hard border - no one would dare construct it or police it.
1.6.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: The EU \(as an institution\) does not have the power or prerogative to construct border infrastructure or police the borders of its member states.
1.6.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: No one other than UK PM or Taoiseach has authority to make such decisions, and neither May nor Varadkaw would be keen to do it as this would entail political suicide.
1.6.2.2.2.2. Pro: If there is no border with a hard brexit, then there is de facto free movement of people in Ireland between the EU and the UK. This result in not achieving the "control our border" brexit objective.
1.6.2.2.3. Con: If NI and the UK had different customs terms but no hard border separating them, it would immediately become a trivial smuggling route for anyone seeking to evade either set of terms.
1.6.2.2.4. Pro: The border with Ireland did not come about because of the EU.
1.6.2.2.4.1. Pro: The [Common Travel Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area) began in 1923, the year after the Republic of Ireland seceded from the UK. The EU didn't start to come together [until 1951](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).
1.6.2.2.4.2. Pro: After the Irish Civil War, the CTA Agreement was complemented by the [1952 Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area), when all immigration controls were removed, removing the border. But Ireland didn't join the EU [until 1973](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/subjects/history/history-the-full-story/ireland-in-modern-times/joining-the-eu/).
1.6.2.2.5. Pro: Both the EU and UK have explained their willingness to make a deal and avoid a hard border.
1.6.2.2.5.1. Con: Neither have been able to actually agree how to avoid a hard border.
1.6.2.3. Pro: The softening of the UK-Ireland border has been a major achievement, and major underpinning, of the Good Friday Agreement process which has brought and consolidated peace in Northern Ireland. Any change to the status of the border is likely to have an impact on the peace process.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that, after seeing the benefits of peace the good Friday agreement has brought, either side would seek to militarize if a hard border was introduced. Whilst this step may cause a few issues, all sides want peace and that will prevail.
1.6.2.4. Con: It may be that the reintroduction of a border in order to deliver Brexit is, on balance, preferred because of the relative gain from regaining control of our borders even when set against the potential consequences on the UK-Ireland settlement.
1.6.3. Pro: Leaving the EU increases the chances of a positive vote on Scottish independence, thus destroying the UK itself.
1.6.3.1. Con: Leaving the EU actually diminishes the likelihood of Scottish independence. A Scotland outside the EU and the UK would be outside both customs unions. As a member of the UK it would at least stay in the one within which it does [most of its trade](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38743532).
1.7. Con: With the biggest opponent of an "ever closer union" gone, the EU would have a much easier way to bring its member states together under the same umbrella.
1.7.1. Pro: It would be easier to harmonize policy making in the EU since, instead of the current three, only two major actors - Germany and France - would remain.
1.7.2. Con: There has been relatively little further integration since the UK has left the EU.
1.7.3. Pro: The UK has a track record of objecting to pushs for deeper military integration.
1.7.3.1. Con: Often this resistance was dropped eventually as was the case with a [European military HQ](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-army-uk-drops-objections-to-eu-military-unit/amp/).
1.7.3.1.1. Con: This still means that the UK has slown things down.
1.7.4. Con: The UK is not the only country with mixed feelings about further integration. To exclude the UK from the EU on that basis would necessarily mean to exclude other EU countries from the EU.
1.7.4.1. Con: The EU may not further expand its powers without treaty change, which requires unanimous approval by all member states. Hence further integration could be blocked if any member state disagrees
1.7.4.2. Pro: [Poland](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-andrzej-duda-rule-of-law-ups-the-ante-against-brussels/), [Hungary](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-approves-hungary-censure-motion/) and [Italy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/italy-invites-poland-to-the-anti-eu-party) are using euro-skeptic rhetoric at home and abroad. They will oppose further European integration. With the UK leaving the EU, the EU will still face the same opposition to further integration.
1.7.4.3. Con: There is no other EUrosceptic country in the EU with remotely as much power as the UK.
1.8. Pro: Remaining in the EU is the only way for the UK to weigh significantly on the international scene and be able to negotiate on equal terms with today's major powers.
1.8.1. Con: The EU does not have a collective desire. The influence gained by being a member of the 28 member group is likely to be squandered by the indecision created by 28 differing priorities. The scope of this indecision will vary dependent upon the subject: with trade negotiations it will be increased, but with global issues it may be decreased as priorities are more likely to be aligned.
1.8.2. Pro: The UK no longer has the leverage over countries outside Europe that it used to; therefore it will not be able to make deals with those countries that are equally beneficial to both sides.
1.8.2.1. Con: Making mutually beneficial deals with other countries does not require leverage. Those deals are made by virtue of them being mutallly beneficial.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: This overtly optimistic idea about the UK's leverage in trade negotiations may be a product of the longing for a past in which the country had more weight, for example as a colonial power.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: This is illustrated by the fact that Britains state in polls that [life before the EU was better](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1546131/Britons-think-life-before-the-EU-was-better.html) - which is when Britain still had an Empire.
1.8.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Before the UK joined the EU it was ["the sick man of Europe"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe), therefore conditions before the UK joined the EU were not good as people referred to in the parent claim have themselves claimed.
1.8.2.2. Con: The UK has very good relationships with many counties outside of the EU and the Commonwealth, too. America, Japan, Saudi Arabia.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: The UK's good relationship with Amercia is at least partly due to its [value as a link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/who-becomes-the-uss-best-friend-in-europe-after-britain-leaves-the-eu/2018/11/24/3b17ab2a-ec15-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html?utm_term=.10fcff5ba03a) with the EU.
1.8.2.3. Pro: A lack of relative bargaining power means that even deals the UK manages to make will be of [only marginal benefit to them](https://ideas.repec.org/b/cup/cbooks/9780521576475.html)
1.8.2.4. Con: The UK still has close relations with and the support of the 52 other members of the [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations).
1.8.2.4.1. Con: The commonwealth represents [13.74%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Commonwealth_of_Nations_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) of the world's GDP, the EU represents [27.87%](https://tradingeconomics.com/european-union/gdp). Thus, it would be unwise to favor the commonwealth over the EU.
1.8.3. Pro: The UK is not a major power anymore. It's GDP \(nominal\) is less than [a seventh of US GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29) \(nominal\) and almost [a fifth China's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29) \(nominal\).
1.8.4. Con: The UK would have the opportunity to join/form groups with other countries, thus maintaining influence on the global stage.
1.8.4.1. Pro: The Japanese Prime Minister [has said](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45780889) that the UK could join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
1.8.4.2. Pro: There has been long-standing support for the establishment of a [CANZUK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANZUK) economic bloc involving with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
1.8.4.3. Con: Given Canada, Australia and New Zealand's significant geographic distance from the UK, it is reasonable to assume that they will continue to hold their primary economic interests outside the UK \(as of now, Canada's most important trading partner is the US, while Australia and NZ are active in the Asia-Pacific market\). The UK would be a marginal trading partner for these countries.
1.8.5. Pro: The UK has more bargaining power as a member of an EU collective than it does individually against significantly larger economies like the US or China.
1.8.6. Con: The UK weighed significantly on the international scene prior to the establishment of the EU. There is no reason to believe it won't in a post-Brexit environment.
1.8.6.1. Con: A significant amount of change has occurred since and the position of the UK before the EU was established doesn't offer any insight to its future international influence. The UK's prosperity is not a given or a right, it is not part of any natural order. It is naive in the extreme and dangerous to make assumptions about our future on the basis of our history.
1.8.6.2. Con: Britain joined the European Economic Community \(ECC\) in 1973, and the British empire is widely acknowledged to have ended in the decades that followed \(with the decolonisation of Zimbabwe, constitutional independence for Canada and Australia, etc\). It is reasonable to suggest that a country that is no longer a global imperial power is weaker now than it was before.
1.8.7. Con: Worldwide, the UK is the worlds [seventh biggest economy](http://statisticstimes.com/economy/projected-world-gdp-ranking.php).
1.8.8. Con: The UK, as a member of the EU, would inevitably be drawn into all kinds of conflicts that it might be able to stay from as a non-member.
1.8.8.1. Con: The EU should be part of the EU, influencing world politics and engaging in the resolution of problems in other countries.
1.8.8.2. Pro: The EU and its member countries are currently involved in [half a dozen](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/430/military-and-civilian-missions-and-operations_en) military missions around the globe.
1.9. Pro: Other EU states want the UK to stay.
1.9.1. Con: Not all states necessarily agree with this sentiment since they didn't openly speak out.
1.9.2. Pro: Leading politicians like [Angela Merkel](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/angela-merkel-britain-remain-eu-european-union) and [Emanuel Macron](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/emmanuel-macron-brexit-uk-stay-eu-france-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-donald-tusk-a8557126.html) have expressed their openness or desire for the UK to stay.
1.9.3. Pro: [54%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/european-neighbours-want-britain-to-remain-but-only-just) of citizens in 28 member states would like the UK to remain in the EU.
1.9.3.1. Con: There is limited basis for national decision making based on popular opinion polls in other countries.
1.9.4. Pro: High-ranking EU politicians such as [Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/emmanuel-macron-brexit-uk-stay-eu-france-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker-donald-tusk-a8557126.html) have expressed their openness for Britain staying.
1.9.5. Con: What other countries want should not determine what the UK does, especially when this is not in the UK's national interest.
1.9.6. Pro: Civil society wants the UK to remain as illustrated by the [Hug A Brit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug_A_Brit) movement.
1.10. Pro: The EU is a guarantor of peace in Europe by bringing its countries closer together and overcoming the disputes of the past.
1.10.1. Con: Peace in Europe is due to many factors that have little to do with the EU.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Democracies usually [don't go to war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory) with each other.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Countries with shared values tend to be allies. The UK shares many values with European countries, regardless of whether they are tied together in a political union or not.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: It can be argued that these shared values partly exist due to decades of cooperation within the EU.
1.10.1.3. Pro: It has been suggested that the atomic bomb has been a big factor in minimizing war. The thought of war using atomic weapons has made countries less likely to have have military conflict.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: This is debatable in the context of Europe. The only countries with nuclear weapons in Europe are France and the UK. These two haven't been waging war against each other - or even come close - for much longer than they had nuclear weapons.
1.10.1.3.2. Con: The idea that atomic weapons make us safer relies upon deterrence theory and Mutually Assured Destruction. Since both the [US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative) and Russia have at some point or are still working on means to [eliminate](https://youtu.be/XG1QOnA7xyA) the balance of power, it is not atomic weapons that have made war less likely, but the lack of technological progress in developing superior weapons systems.
1.10.1.3.2.1. Pro: Political unity achieved via diplomacy does not rely on a technological stalemate.
1.10.1.3.2.2. Pro: With atomic weapons being neutralised by Mutually Assured Destruction, pending the development of alternative destructive or protective technology, some nations have [weaponised disinformation](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/advisory/articles/weaponized-information.html), arguably a far more dangerous weapon.
1.10.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Political unity is a more effective defence against weaponised disinformation and is the target of such attacks.
1.10.1.3.3. Con: There have been numerous [technical close calls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls), as well as several political scenarios \([Cuba](https://youtu.be/XbKCyQn5oTc)\) \([West Germany](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/03/17/pershing-ii-missile-why-it-alarms-soviets/20eca6f0-3a64-4bdf-9957-ae54261b6ca6/?utm_term=.9cac7f4c4d4e)\) where conflict was extremely close and any single one of which may have led to catastrophic destruction.
1.10.1.3.4. Pro: A [prominent argument](http://home.sogang.ac.kr/sites/jaechun/courses/Lists/b6/Attachments/39/5.%20The%20spread%20of%20nuclear%20weapons.pdf) in the academic field of International Relations is that the presence of nuclear weapons makes the prospect of war so terrible that it deters conflict. Following that logic, nuclear weapons are a guarantor of peace.
1.10.1.3.4.1. Con: Deterrence is a theory only.
1.10.1.3.4.2. Con: There are prominent arguments that Mutually Assured Destruction is [incredibly risky](https://www.thereaganvision.org/the-reagan-vision/), a form of [psychological terrorism against a state's own civilian population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) and [completely insane](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/).
1.10.1.3.4.3. Con: [Having big guns](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/do-guns-make-us-safer-science-suggests-no/) [doesn't make us safer](https://fpif.org/nuclear-weapons-guns-comrades-arms/). [Talking about our differences](https://youtu.be/KY5TWVz5ZDU) makes us safer.
1.10.1.3.5. Con: There is [scepticism](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nuclear-deterrence-hardes_b_518525) regarding deterrence theory.
1.10.1.3.6. Pro: The number of conflicts between states [has been declining \(p. 2\)](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Dupuy%2C%20Rustad-%20Trends%20in%20Armed%20Conflict%2C%201946–2017%2C%20Conflict%20Trends%205-2018.pdf) throughout the decades since the introduction of nuclear weapons.
1.10.1.3.6.1. Con: There is a [difference](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/wi-phi/wiphi-critical-thinking/wiphi-fundamentals/v/critical-thinking-fundamentals-correlation-and-causation) between correlation and causation.
1.10.1.3.6.2. Con: The link in the parent claim lists five causes of a reduction in violence, none of which are nuclear weapons.
1.10.1.3.7. Con: There are [other theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory) for reduced conflict.
1.10.1.3.8. Con: If nuclear weapons made us safer, they would have been distributed to all nation states.
1.10.1.3.9. Con: To be deterred from using nuclear weapons, enemies need to be genuinely concerned that the other side is crazy enough to use theirs. In order for deterrence to work, the US would need to [deliberately](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentials_of_Post%E2%80%93Cold_War_Deterrence) portray elements of its government as out of control in order to create fear and uncertainty in its political rivals.
1.10.1.3.9.1. Pro: The [current incumbent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48714414) is fulfilling this role with skill and flair.
1.10.1.3.9.2. Pro: There is no way for the public to tell whether or not the US is actually out of control - and if it is, then it is, by definition extremely dangerous.
1.10.1.3.9.3. Con: There is no general perception, neither by the public nor by policy makers in other countries, that the US is out of control.
1.10.1.3.10. Con: In a world where peace and war are [increasingly redundant states](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/british-special-forces-to-get-new-mission-to-counter-state-actors?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard), judging the impact of atomic weapons by overt war is meaningless.
1.10.1.4. Pro: Trade between countries helps keep peace. America and China are a good example.
1.10.1.4.1. Con: America and China are currently engaged in a [trade war](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45899310).
1.10.1.4.1.1. Pro: Current relations are [said to be](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46395379) at their worst since the second World War.
1.10.1.4.2. Con: The EU has helped to increase trade and commerce.
1.10.1.5. Pro: Military cooperation in the form of NATO has helped prevent war.
1.10.1.6. Pro: Having a common enemy in Russia has helped European countries be allies rather than enemies.
1.10.1.7. Con: The EU was unanimously awarded the 2012 [Nobel prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Nobel_Peace_Prize) for the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights over six decades.
1.10.1.8. Pro: A material war is no longer a sensible option for countries as most of the wealth is in the service economy and not in material possesions. Thus, the EU is not a primary reason that there is peace in Europe.
1.10.1.9. Con: Peace in Europe is due to many factors. That some of these factors may not have much to do with the EU does not make the EU less necessary for peace, nor are non-EU factors shown to be sufficient in the absence of the EU to keep peace.
1.10.2. Con: The European Economic Community that developed into the European Union is predated by NATO which was formed to combat the Soviet Union's influence, peace in Europe is more likely a product of the Soviet Union functioning as the conciliatory threat. With the fall of the Soviet Union both Russia and China have taken the role.
1.10.3. Con: Since the EU is perceived to take away from countries uniqueness, this leads to polarization, thus increasing the potential for conflict.
1.10.4. Con: Since UK citizens have voted against these gains, it is not important that these gains exist. They are not seen as worth the costs of EU membership.
1.10.4.1. Con: Most citizens don't know about the complexities of the EU \([1](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=GB&q=What%20is%20the%20EU)\) \([2](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/nov/27/brits-least-knowledgeable-european-union-basic-questions)\), thus it would be unwise to go purely off of their opinion.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: This is why we have representative democracy, not referenda.
1.10.4.2. Con: That the UK electorate voted to leave the EU does not indicate that peace isn't worthwhile.
1.10.5. Pro: Europe has enjoyed its longest period of peace since the formation of international confederations such as the EU.
1.10.5.1. Pro: The EU was given [The Nobel Peace Prize in 2012](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2012/eu/facts/) for their contributions to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.
1.10.5.2. Con: It would appear that the rise of right wing nationalist and populist politics is putting a [strain](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjmyI6Jr6rgAhWVAWMBHY0ADqkQzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-france-italy%2Ffrance-recalls-italy-ambassador-after-worst-verbal-onslaught-since-the-war-idUSKCN1PW1GJ&psig=AOvVaw1XGfOhVc3P2nKBrpZ1-ar9&ust=1549654516508027) on that hard won peace.
1.10.6. Con: It is highly unlikely that European countries will fight each other merely because they are not members of the same particular group - the EU.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Sweden is in the EU and Norway is not - war with either is extremely unlikely and independent of whether they are members of the EU.
1.10.6.2. Con: The EU is more than just a nominal group - it includes political, legal and economic ties that act as the actual guarantors of peace by making intraeuropean war prohibitively expensive.
1.10.6.3. Con: And yet history tells us very clearly that this is exactly the reason why European countries have fought in the past. The whole reason for creating the EU was to avoid another war like World War 1 or World War 2.
1.10.6.3.1. Pro: The EU functions as an alliance that voids conflicting military alliances among the states of Europe.
1.10.6.4. Con: The EU also acts as a unified power block to deter countries on its edges from destabilising or threatening.
1.10.6.5. Con: Non-membership of the EU would not be the main cause - there are other reasons why they might end up in conflict with one another and the EU is a mechanism to helps ensure this never happens.
1.10.7. Pro: The European Parliament and European Court of Justice provide forums for democratic debate and exchange on European matters which might otherwise or have in the past flared into conflict.
1.10.7.1. Con: The UN holds exactly the same role on the global level yet the conflicts still happen. Rather than explaining peace in Europe \(or rather a lack of mayor conflicts apart from the Balkan Wars\) through the influence of the EU, it can be explained with the presence of developed democracies and pretty fresh memories of two Worlds Wars.
1.10.8. Con: The singular absence of the United Kingdom from the EU probably wouldn't cause conflict in continental Europe.
1.10.8.1. Con: There [remain concerns](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/brexit-impact-in-northern-ireland-when-peace-is-at-stake/) that it risks sliding back towards conflict in Northern Ireland.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.12. Con: The EU has centralized power and continues to further do so, which means the UK has less control over its own laws and practices.
1.12.1. Con: The main focus of EU centralisation of power is where these powers are needed to make the Single Market work smoothly, i.e. legislation to ensure the free flow of goods, services, money and labour. The Single Market was mainly a UK initiative, pushed particularly by the government of Margaret Thatcher.
1.12.2. Con: Most large countries in the EU pass sovereign powers upwards and downwards.
1.12.2.1. Pro: The UK devolves powers to local authorities, the 4 nations, and upwards to the EU, NATO, Commonwealth and WTO/WHO/UN.
1.12.3. Pro: The EU can impose regulations on countries where domestic politicians refuse to acknowledge and ignore a problem, for example selling [toxic fish from the Baltic sea](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&artikel=4586465) \(Sweden\) or [beef linked to Mad Cow Disease](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4785610.stm) \(UK\).
1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.
1.12.5. Pro: Globally, the popular tendency is towards the distribution of power as thinly and widely as possible, which suggests that is what societies want right now.
1.12.5.1. Pro: The rise of bitcoin, social media and localisation/anti-globalisation are all examples of this trend.
1.12.5.1.1. Con: Bitcoin, social media and localisation/anti-globalisation are different phenomena in substance from the European Union and the organisation of political power among governments. Indeed they could all coexist with a centralised EU - there is nothing intrinsic in those trends that has clear lessons for the future of the EU.
1.12.5.1.2. Con: Internet based technologies are not an argument against centralisation. Regardless of how sites appear to be structured, the existence of the consumer internet depends on communications architecture which is heavy centralized and government monitored.
1.12.5.2. Con: Power being distributed more thinly across the population does not seem to correlate with trend for ever [increased inequality](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/93/2/429/2997439).
1.12.6. Pro: The EU is making laws uniform for over 300 million disparate people, which is likely to be ineffective as these people lead such different realities in such different contexts.
1.12.6.1. Con: The US has federal laws that cover more than 300 million people.
1.12.6.2. Con: Some people inside the UK are just as disparate from each other than they are from people in the EU. A middle class city worker in London would likely relate much more to a middle class city worker in Paris, than they would to a rural Welsh farmer.
1.12.6.3. Con: The EU only makes certain laws uniform in each member state, not all laws.
1.12.6.4. Con: The EU is not a federal union. Drafting of legislation is never done without the full participation of directly elected Members of the European Parliament \(who represent the diversity of local realities in Europe\) and/or the national governments making decisions themselves.
1.12.6.4.1. Pro: This fact was put on full display when the free trade deal between the EU and Canada \(CETA\) almost collapsed when Belgium could not sign due to concerns raised by the leaders of the Walloon Region.
1.12.6.5. Con: Transposition of EU law into national \(or regional\) law has always been done by the national / member state authorities and therefore always adapted to specific realities in the various countries of the EU.
1.12.7. Con: The EU issues and enforces directives made to serve the interest of the EU citizens. The UK is [already struggling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44155590) to enforce the clean air directives on its own.
1.12.7.1. Con: The UK is [not struggling hard enough](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful) to enforce [clean air](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/19/uk-is-endangering-peoples-health-by-denying-their-right-to-clean-air-says-un) directives because of [government policy](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollution-strategy-car-lorry-emissions-campaign-a8362071.html) decisions.
1.12.8. Con: The UK is still a member of other international organisations that exert significant influence over how the country is governed - but there is no equivalent demand to leave them on the basis of defending the UK's sovereignty.
1.12.8.1. Pro: Members of the World Trade Organisation, including the UK, [are required](https://www.wiley.law/article-The-WTO-Is-Inappropriately-Usurping-American-Sovereignty) to abide by the judgements of its dispute resolution panels, even if they require amending or removing trade protection laws.
1.12.8.2. Pro: The UK's defence policy is heavily influenced by NATO.
1.12.8.2.1. Pro: Members of NATO [are expected](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm) to adhere to a 2006 agreement to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defence.
1.12.9. Pro: Any federal or confederal body involves the surrender of some portion of sovereignty for the advancement of shared purpose.
1.12.10. Pro: The EU is incompatible with English Common Law and Constitutional Monarchy. [Macarthys Ltd v Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarthys_Ltd_v_Smith) is an example of the two conflicting. [Conflict of constitutional law in the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law#Conflict_of_laws) concisely explains how the two principles of governance can collide.
1.12.10.1. Con: The cases cited, and the Wikipedia article referenced, do not support the claim that the EU is "incompatible". On the contrary, they demonstrate that there are viable mechanisms to examine and resolve any cases where there is a conflict.
1.12.11. Con: The EU's centralization of power takes place in agreement with the member states and its democratically legitimized representatives, and in particular the government ministers in the [Council of the European Union](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu_en).
1.12.12. Con: This is only the case for certain things that have to be done on a larger scale like import tariffs, defense, etc.
1.12.13. Pro: By leaving, the UK's courts would regain final say over all their rulings due to the [European Court of Justice \(ECJ\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) ceasing to act as their highest court of appeal.
1.12.13.1. Con: Very few cases actually go before the European Court of Justice. European Law is almost always applied by national courts. The European Court of Justice interprets EU law on the request of national judges.
1.12.13.2. Con: On the flipside, the UK looses the ability to sue EU member states, the institutions or any legal person with sufficient standing in front of the ECJ.
1.12.13.3. Con: In the current agreement the UK abides to the "[common rulebook](https://www.google.de/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjCus7U7-LeAhXC2aQKHXYiCkgQzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fuk-britain-eu-ecj%2Fuks-proposed-legal-relationship-with-eu-would-leave-ecj-in-charge-lawyer-says-idUSKCN1ML1C5&psig=AOvVaw33sfeAXX0tvusGI0g7m1n5&ust=1542799907037496)" of the EU.
1.12.14. Pro: The UK is made up of four countries to which more and more powers are being devolved to. The EU is a union that seeks to increase control over member states. These two stances are largely incompatible.
1.12.15. Con: The UK remains involved in EU-decision making even with deeper integration.
1.12.15.1. Pro: The UK sends MEPs that vote in the European Parliament.
1.12.15.2. Pro: The UK, as all other countries, has one commissioner that influences draft proposals.
1.12.15.3. Pro: The UK is represented in the Council of Ministers.
1.12.16. Pro: The EU strives to become an "[ever closer Union](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7230)".
1.12.17. Con: Though there may be issues with increased centralisation, a total severance of ties is overkill and is much more destructive than healthy conversation and reformation.
1.12.18. Con: Centralisation has its place. It is necessary to address global issues through cooperation. The EU falls a long way short of global cooperation, but it is a good step in the right direction.
1.12.18.1. Pro: With the world being more connected and integrated, with more issues of a global nature, the Integration of the political power is needed as a natural response.
1.12.19. Pro: The EU requires that all its member nations be democratic. This restricts the UK's ability to experiment with alternate methods of governance.
1.12.19.1. Con: The people of the UK have almost no desire to give up [democracy](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/38184/bsa31_democracy.pdf).
1.12.19.2. Con: The UK is entirely free to elect non-democratic parties, even if that means the UK is expelled from the EU.
1.12.20. Con: The people of the UK retain control over the laws and regulations under which they live since they democratically elect the politicians who make decisions, whether in London or Brussels.
1.13. Pro: Brexit presents a risk for the civil society and social structure of the UK.
1.13.1. Con: There are many countries not in the EU which have civil society and a good social structure.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Norway is not in the EU, though is closely linked and has a high [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) and [Happiness Index](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/16/these-are-the-top-10-happiest-countries-in-the-world.html).
1.13.1.1.1. Con: Norway never joined the EU, having voted not to in 1994, and so has never exited the EU.
1.13.1.2. Pro: The US is not closely linked to the EU but still has a very high Human Development Index. Membership of the EU is not a necessary condition for a country to thrive.
1.13.1.2.1. Con: The US was never in the EU and so has never left the EU.
1.13.1.3. Con: Countries that were never members of the EU cannot be compared to the UK as they never left the EU and experienced the corresponding impact on their societies.
1.13.2. Pro: Leaving the EU would be a threat to the rights of workers in the UK.
1.13.2.1. Con: The UK is a democracy. Workers in the UK can vote for politicians who will improve their rights. Membership of the EU is not required in order to improve workers' rights.
1.13.3. Pro: The EU treaties include the Charter of Fundamental Rights, enforced by an independent multi-national court accessible to all citizens and residents.
1.13.3.1. Con: The UK is a signatory of the EHCR and will remain so after Brexit, so there is little change and no real threat to human rights.
1.13.3.2. Con: This does not apply to the UK or Poland. Both countries [have an opt-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union#Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union_%E2%80%93_Poland_and_the_United_Kingdom) on the power of the ECJ with respect to citizens’s rights.
1.13.4. Con: The UK's civil society and democracy were created for much longer and have far richer heritage that the ones of the EU. Revoking a membership in the international organization will have no influence for them at all.
1.13.4.1. Con: The UK has, over a period of 40 years, entwined its civil society and economy with that of its European neighbours. What it did before this period of harmonisation is not relevant to where it is now. Emerging rapidly from such carefully constructed relationships is a risk, and one that is unprecedented.
1.14. Pro: Only by remaining in the EU would the UK be capable of contributing to EU reform.
1.14.1. Con: The powers that be in the EU have resisted reform so far, despite attempts by those who feel it's needed. If UK left the EU, this would cause pain and, as such serve as a warning that pleas for reform cannot simply be ignored. This may give support to others suggesting reform. So while this point is correct, UK could indirectly contribute to reform by leaving.
1.14.2. Con: The leaders of the EU wish to lead the EU toward closer integration and have demonstrated that they does not want reform in the way that UK voters do.
1.14.2.1. Pro: Emmanuel Macron, the French President, has continuously argued for [closer political integration](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/profound-transformation-macron-lays-out-vision-for-post-brexit-eu).
1.14.2.2. Pro: Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, is calling for [tighter integration](https://www.ft.com/content/f1d5ec78-9851-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b) of the EU member countries.
1.14.2.3. Pro: Polls conducted in the UK routinely show that that more British [oppose rather than support](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/if-major-reforms-were-made-that-led-to-greater-economic-and-political-integration-would-be-a-good-or-bad-thing-for-the-uk/) plans for tighter EU integration, and that most of them [don't want the UK to be part](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/which-of-the-following-statements-best-reflect-your-view/) of a more integrated EU.
1.14.2.4. Pro: Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also backs calls for [closer integration](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/spain-pm-urges-greater-european-integrat-idUSBRE9B70CZ20131208).
1.14.2.5. Con: Other EU member countries share the UK's concerns about closer integration, and as further integration has to happen unanimously, it is not a realistic prospect for the foreseeable future.
1.14.2.5.1. Con: Many EU nations opposed to EU integration, such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, have limited influence on that process due to their population and economic contribution.
1.14.2.5.1.1. Con: Further integration through expansion of EU competence requires [unanimous approval](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/how-new-member-states-join-the-eu-all-you-need-to-know/) of member states. Member states remain in complete control of the integration process and any one member can block it
1.14.2.6. Con: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte [rejected the notion](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-netherlands/dutch-pm-rejects-romance-of-ever-closer-european-union-idUKKCN1GE21U) that the European Union is on an inevitable path towards greater political integration.
1.14.3. Pro: The UK is still one of the leading EU nations, judging by the size of the population, numbers of the MEPs and size of the financial contributions.
1.14.4. Con: Even with the threat of the UK leaving the EU, David Cameron was unable to win a single significant concession from Brussels when he attempt to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU in 2016.
1.14.4.1. Con: David Cameron did win some [proposed concessions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105) they where canceled when the UK voted to leave.
1.14.4.2. Pro: Cameron did not win sufficient concessions to change the minds of enough people to win a referendum.
1.14.4.3. Con: If a country could just threaten the EU with leaving so that they can acquire more advantages, then the point of the EU would gradually be lost
1.14.5. Con: The UK tried to contribute to EU reform but this attempts failed, hence the decision to leave. Now there is no reason to contribute, similarly the UK would not be involved in reforming ASEAN or MERCOSUR.
1.15. Pro: Leaving would harm the EU.
1.15.1. Con: The wish of UK was a sign to the other EU countries how fragile the EU was and lead to a change in the minds. Following that, the EU countries acted stronger with a more consistent voice in the negotiations with UK. The EU today is stronger and more united than before.
1.15.2. Pro: Although any economic harm caused by leaving could be dealt with by the EU, exports from the EU to the UK [would still suffer](https://www.euronews.com/2018/12/19/how-would-uk-eu-trade-be-affected-by-a-no-deal-brexit).
1.15.3. Pro: Leaving would reduce the size of the EU economy and reduce its bargaining power with other nations.
1.15.4. Pro: The UK, as a key member of the EU with strong economy, could severely injure economies of weaker EU countries who require the EU for help.
1.15.4.1. Pro: Weaker EU countries might be majorly affected by Brexit, as the UK has the [6th largest economy in the world](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=104&pr.y=16&sy=2018&ey=2018&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=924%2C132%2C134%2C534%2C158%2C112%2C111&s=NGDPD&grp=0&a=), and contributed a large amount to the EU.
1.16. Pro: Leaving the European Union is likely to be economically catastrophic for the UK.
1.16.1. Con: Other developed nations such as the US and Australia grow [as fast or faster](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?end=2017&locations=US-GB-FR-AU-XD-DE-CA&name_desc=false&start=1961&view=chart) than developed countries in the EU. There is no reason why the UK cannot replicate their success as an independent nation.
1.16.2. Pro: Brexit will [negatively affect](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42257277) London's talent pool.
1.16.3. Con: The EU [has expressed](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/20/macron-says-a-bespoke-trade-deal-between-the-uk-and-eu-is-possible) its willingness to agree both a transmission deal and a full FTA with the UK thereafter, which will mitigate the negative effects of leaving the EU.
1.16.3.1. Con: Mitigate effects, maybe. Match the benefits, never. The other 27 EU countries are never going to agree on a deal that's more beneficial to the UK than staying in the EU.
1.16.4. Pro: The British economy is already suffering as a consequence of Brexit.
1.16.4.1. Pro: The British government is revising the country's economic growth given [evidence of downturn](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/uk-economy-shows-greatest-signs-of-stress-since-2012).
1.16.4.2. Pro: Reports say that leaving is already costing [£500 million a week](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy/brexit-has-cost-britain-500-million-pounds-a-week-study-says-idUKKCN1MA0DU).
1.16.4.3. Pro: The prospect of Brexit has already starting to drive [companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/brexit-deal-too-late-to-stop-some-eu-firms-from-moving-business) and [banks](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/uk-banks-brexit-jobs-no-deal-move-eu-city-london-a8416506.html) out of the UK, and with them job and opportunities.
1.16.5. Pro: The devaluation of the pound would be the most terrible blow to the heart of the UK, which is an importing nation.
1.16.5.1. Con: It would help UK exports be more competitive.
1.16.6. Con: Almost all of the "[Project Fear](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Fear_\(British_politics\))" predictions about the economic, social and political damages that a Brexit would inflict on the UK have not turned out to be true.
1.16.6.1. Con: -> See 1.16.4.
1.16.6.2. Con: The UK has not yet left the EU, so it's too soon to judge.
1.16.6.3. Con: -> See 1.16.4.3.
1.16.6.4. Con: The "Project Fear" predictions haven't come true yet because measures were taken to mitigate them.
1.16.7. Pro: Multiple economic bodies have predicted a weaker economy for the UK, in the long term, outside of the Union.
1.16.7.1. Pro: The [OECD](https://www.ft.com/content/57773be4-d426-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9) predicts weak economic growth for the UK due to Brexit.
1.16.7.2. Pro: The [EIU](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/brexit-damage-uk-economy-eiu-vote-eu-recession) warns the damage from a decision to leave the EU will be felt until at least 2020.
1.16.7.3. Pro: A leaked [UK government forecast](http://www.dw.com/en/brexit-will-leave-uk-worse-off-in-every-scenario-leaked-report-predicts/a-42360406) reportedly predicts that the British economy will suffer no matter what trade deal is struck with the European Union.
1.16.8. Con: The EU is the [slowest growing market](https://fullfact.org/economy/global-economic-growth/) in the world today. Leaving would allow Britain to establish bilateral trade with growing markets, i.e. MERCOSUR, SE Asia, while still in their in infancy, allowing better terms to be established than with traditionally economically strong nations.
1.16.8.1. Con: Rate of growth of an economic association is not a proxy for its value to a member state. Smaller size organisations typically exhibit higher growth rates but their total increase in value may still be significantly less than that of a much larger organisation with a slower growth rate. 5% of a very big number is a bigger quantity than 50% of a very small number.
1.16.8.2. Con: The EU has already initiated trade negotiations with countries of SE Asia such as [Vietnam, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/negotiations-and-agreements/) Being a market of nearly 500 million consumers, the EU has great negotiating power, especially in trade matters. Therefore, the EU can achieve better trade terms with third countries than the UK alone.
1.16.9. Pro: There is a very high cost involved in duplicating a lot of EU backed institutions on a national level \(for example European Drug Agency, or the aviation regulators\)
1.16.10. Con: For the EU to allow such a catastrophe in the UK would transform it into a union based on economic duress rather than mutual co-operation.
1.16.10.1. Con: This is irrelevant; there is no argument here that tells us Brexit would be better for the UK.
1.16.10.2. Con: One cannot expect the benefits of being a club member without actually being one.
1.16.10.3. Con: If the UK chooses to leave the EU then there is no treaty or any other obligation on the EU to provide economic protection for a departing member state.
1.16.10.4. Pro: Article 50 exists to indicate that nations joining the EU are not trapped in it. If Brexit proved that nations were in effect trapped in the EU by the threat of economic consequences, this could be seen as federalism or imperialism by other nations with levels of Euroscepticism or a desire for EU reform.
1.16.10.4.1. Con: One cannot expect the same benefits of the EU while being outside of the EU. If a country can fall apart so easily \(economically\) then this is the fault of the country at hand.
1.16.10.4.1.1. Con: No country in the EU can require its businesses to be resilient to leaving the EU. If it was even legally possible to do so, those businesses would move elsewhere via the same freedoms the EU allows. Nobody told the EU that making sure an economic union remained voluntary was easy.
1.16.11. Pro: Leaving the EU means that the UK also leaves the trade agreements made by the EU. Because of this the UK will have to sign new trade deals which will be done under less advantageous conditions as they won't have the leverage that the EU does.
1.16.12. Pro: Parts of the United Kingdom, such as [Northern Ireland](http://data.nicva.org/article/how-much-eu-funds-northern-ireland-agriculture) rely heavily on the agricultural subventions by the European Union.
1.16.13. Pro: Europe funds regions directly and invests [£5 billion per year in the UK](https://www.myeu.uk/#/)
1.16.14. Pro: Being in the customs union means that when UK companies want to import from and export to European countries, they pay no customs duty and there are no administrative formalities
1.16.15. Pro: Standards for products sold across the EU are developed in a coordinated fashion, thus freeing businesses from the need to adapt their products to different country-specific standards.
1.16.16. Pro: 44.5% of the UK's [exports](https://www.statista.com/statistics/551209/united-kingdom-uk-exports-eu-european-union-share/) in 2017 were to the EU. These trade flows would be [negatively impacted](https://www.pwc.nl/nl/brexit/documents/pwc-brexit-monitor-trade.pdf) as trade costs increase even under the most optimistic assumptions.
1.16.17. Pro: [Government impact analysis](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8451) shows that GDP will be reduced by between 2 and 9%.
1.16.18. Con: The British Economy will no longer be tethered to the tremendous debts other Euro countries are accumulating.
1.17. Pro: The European Union is a force for ensuring that the UK and other countries apply internationally agreed legislation.
1.17.1. Pro: The European Union is committed to climate change action and urges member states to meet ecological targets.
1.17.2. Con: There are various other organizations that fulfill the same function, such as the UN, NATO or the WTO. The wast majority of the EU's members are also members of these organizations. Multiplying the same functions leads to more bureaucracy, weakens responsibilities and costs more.
1.18. Pro: The UK and the EU share a history and a common culture.
1.18.1. Con: The UK has no particular historical connection with many EU nations, such as Slovenia or Lithuania.
1.18.1.1. Con: Slovenia and Lithuania are poor examples given that they simply have not existed \(at least in their modern forms\) for a significant duration of time. The UK has many cultural ties to states they were formerly a part of.
1.18.2. Pro: Many European states share the same [folklore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm) with the UK and folklore is "[the expressive body of culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore)".
1.18.3. Pro: There is general agreement on the existence of [core elements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Europe) that form the cultural foundation of modern Europe, which includes the UK.
1.18.4. Con: The UK also has highly important relationships with countries outside the EU - notably the United States and the Commonwealth.
1.18.4.1. Con: Other EU members have equally important relationships with countries outside the EU, for example France and the Netherlands with their respective former colonies and overseas territories, and they do not perceive the EU as an obstacle in maintaining these international relationships.
1.18.4.2. Pro: Being a member of the EU strengthened the UK's relationships and negotiating positions with external countries.
1.18.5. Pro: British alliances and wars with [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations) stretch back hundreds of years.
1.18.5.1. Con: The UK been at war with all of these countries several times stretching back hundreds of years.
1.18.5.2. Con: Just because there have historically been connections does not mean that relations have to remain institutionalized in the EU. Decisions for the future should be based upon what is best for the future and not be made based on unwillingness to let go of the familiar.
1.18.6. Pro: [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Portuguese_Alliance) was one of Britain's first allies.
1.18.7. Pro: [Cyprus and Malta](http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/MS.12.Cyprus-and-Malta.pdf) were British overseas territories.
1.18.7.1. Con: The ROI gained their independence a 100 of years ago as well. So what that they were British colonies if they are sovereign states today.
1.18.8. Con: The UK can remain close and cooperative with its allies, but that is not an argument for a political union.
1.18.9. Con: A common history is not cause for creating a common future. Just because something has always been does not mean it is the best way.
1.18.10. Con: The EU has no common culture \(compare the cultures of Romania, Greece and Sweden\), therefore there is nothing to share.
1.18.10.1. Con: The territory and population of the European Union largely match those of the Roman and Germanic empires that have shaped the rich and complex history of Europe, including Britain’s, over the past two millennia.
1.18.10.1.1. Pro: The [legacy of the roman empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Roman_Empire) is one shared across many contemporary European states.
1.18.10.2. Con: All EU member countries share mostly Christian populations \(Roman Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox\). The UK ranks right in the middle of all EU countries in terms of religiousness, but has [of all 28 member states the third largest fraction of Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union).
1.18.10.3. Con: -> See 1.18.2.
1.18.11. Con: The history of the UK outside the EU is richer and much longer than its EU membership or even the EU's existence.
1.18.11.1. Con: The UK has been part of political unions with other members of the European Union long before joining the European Economic Community in 1973. For example, the house Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was the family of the sovereigns of the United Kingdom, Belgium, Portugal, and Bulgaria.
1.18.11.2. Con: Most EU members states are much older and have a much richer history than the EU \(in the case of Greece, the world's oldest democracy, covering 2.5 millennia\), and yet would not consider this to be a reason for leaving.
1.18.11.3. Con: The history of this island and a bit of the one next to it is much longer and richer than the concept of the "UK" or even that of nation states. This country was hiberni, pictish and Briton before it was saxon, Norman or roman, was part of mainland Europe before it broke off, was pagan before it was Christian. The concept of "UK" is itself a construct and predated by other forms, just as much as the EU. Its all part of the same history and time is perceived to move forwards, not backwards.
1.18.11.4. Con: The history of the UK outside of the EU is more violent and less prosperous than within.
