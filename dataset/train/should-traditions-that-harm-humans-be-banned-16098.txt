Discussion Name: Should traditions that harm humans be banned?

1. Traditions should be banned if they are harmful to humans.
1.1. Pro: If a tradition leaves you or others with a scar, it cannot be acceptable or legal.
1.1.1. Con: Male circumcision is acceptable in every country in the world and it leaves a [scar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision_scar).
1.1.2. Con: [Scarification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarification) is a widespread and honored practice in many societies.
1.2. Pro: Traditions should not be untouchable. Letting them be so is irrational.
1.3. Pro: Some traditions may cause death.
1.3.1. Pro: [Female genital mutilation](http://time.com/5396125/somalia-female-genital-mutilation-death/) might cause death.
1.3.2. Con: Many traditions that are considered to be 'normal' can cuase death too.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [Christmas tree fires](https://www.toptenz.net/top-10-dangerous-traditions.php) can burn houses down.
1.3.3. Pro: Many people have died while taking part in the [Onbashira](https://www.toptenz.net/top-10-dangerous-traditions.php) tradition.
1.3.4. Pro: [Running of the bulls](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8143744.stm) tradition has killed people.
1.4. Pro: If they are not banned, the authorities allowing such practices are complicit.
1.4.1. Pro: If they are not banned, there's this tacit "social" agreement that anything, including torture and murder, is acceptable if it's part of a culture or religion.
1.4.2. Con: The authorities are not directly responsible for carrying out certain practices. Therefore, they are not morally culpable.
1.4.2.1. Con: Not taking an action to stop something immoral is almost as bad as committing that action.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: In both cases, people have the capacity to take action against something a harmful action. However, in both cases, both parties do not take that action.
1.4.2.2. Pro: They do not intend to cause that harm.
1.5. Con: The state cannot get involved in judging the level of ethics in any given culture or religion.
1.5.1. Pro: People just can't seem to ever agree on this issue. It is politically difficult to pull off a ban like that.
1.5.1.1. Con: Difficulty in enforcing a measure is not a definitive reason not to carry it out.
1.5.2. Con: On almost all models of political [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty), governments do have the right to ban some actions, especially if they are harmful to society, others or oneself.
1.5.3. Con: The state is the reflection of citizens' values and demands, therefore if the majority decided that a tradition is immoral, the state will ban it.
1.5.3.1. Con: [87% of Danes](https://www.thelocal.dk/20161205/danish-doctors-come-out-against-circumcision) and [62% of Brits](https://youtu.be/AM5hqiV25XA?t=511) have decided that the mutilation of boys as that of girls is immoral, and yet neither state has banned it.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The state is the representative of citizens; it does not exist as an autonomous institution that creates new values out of the blue.
1.5.4. Con: This statment is only true in the case of adults who consent to such traditions, children who cannot consent cannot be undifended from abuse for any reason.
1.6. Pro: It would be a giant step forward for feminism.
1.6.1. Pro: Mistreating and socially isolating women who are menstruating is one of the ways in which a woman's biology is used against her throughout her life. Banning this would go some way to liberating women from this sexist reductionism.
1.6.2. Pro: Banning female genital mutilation \(FGM\) would physically and sexually empower women.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Women could begin to enjoy sexual relationships.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Even [women who are victims of the most severe form of genital mutilation](https://youtu.be/Bu_no9KGyI8?t=2340) [can enjoy sexual relationships](https://play.acast.com/s/thehighlowshow/b156398b-bf18-4ade-b79b-92776fe94a92) \(1:00:40\).
1.6.2.2. Con: There is very little connection between FGM and empowerment of women.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Dawoodi Bohra women in India are among the [most empowered women](https://www.firstpost.com/india/dawoodi-bohra-practice-of-khafz-has-been-wrongly-labelled-as-female-genital-mutilation-by-those-with-an-agenda-6038971.html) there and yet FGM is a tradition.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: Women in Saudi are among the [world's least empowered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia) and yet they are generally not victims.
1.6.2.3. Con: If genital mutilation alone disempowered victims then it wouldn't be practiced [mostly on boys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772313) \(37-39% of the worlds males compared to around 5% of the world's female population\), even those who are expected to be leaders.
1.6.2.4. Pro: Since FGM is the [removal of sexually sensitive tissue](https://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122\(14\)00326-0/pdf) like the clitoris, it follows that a woman's sexual self-determination and gratification will be heavily compromised by the procedure. \(p. 50-51\)
1.6.2.4.1. Con: The same source identified that studies on sexual function and sexual quality of life post-FGM are often [small and methodologically flawed](https://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122\(14\)00326-0/pdf). \(p. 50\)
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: Meta-analysis of studies on women's sexual quality of life post-FGM shows that they are [52% more likely](https://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122\(14\)00326-0/pdf) to report [dyspareunia](https://www.healthline.com/health/dyspareunia), which means painful intercourse. \(p. 51\)
1.6.2.4.3. Pro: Women who have had FGM can be physiologically less capable of becoming [sexually stimulated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6386073/). \(p. 1 - TW: article includes graphic content\)
1.6.2.4.3.1. Con: Can be is not the same as will be
1.6.2.4.4. Con: FGM does not always involve the removal of sexually sensitive tissue, the source states "or other injury".
1.6.2.4.5. Con: There is no evidence that women who choose FGM undergo long-term physical or emotional trauma, [most are satisfied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10649154) with their decision.
1.6.2.4.5.1. Con: The overwhelming majority of females undergoing FGM are [under 15 years old](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/), putting them below the age of consent. As such, only a tiny minority can meaningfully be said to "choose" FGM.
1.6.2.4.5.1.1. Con: Females under 15 years of age are not women but girls.
1.6.2.4.6. Con: Women who have had FGM can be pysiologically more capable of experiencing [heightened arousal](http://www.clitoralunhooding.com/).
1.6.3. Con: It goes against [choice feminism](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464700116683657?journalCode=ftya) which argues that women should be able to make choices for themselves since that empowers them.
1.6.3.1. Con: The fact of something being a tradition implies that it is the status quo. This means that women must explicitly opt out of it. Therefore, a woman's choice is already imposed on, which dilutes her freedom to choose.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: It doesn't follow that women must opt out of every aspect of the status quo eg the tradition of a christmas tree.
1.6.3.2. Con: The idea of choice freedom in relation to exceedingly harmful traditions like female genital mutilation \(FGM\) overlooks the fundamental wrongness of the choice being presented. Much like a woman should not have to choose not to be raped, a woman should not have to choose whether to undergo the long-term physical and emotional trauma of FGM.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: FGM is a wide spectrum of practices from [minimally harmful](http://www.theislamicmonthly.com/a-tiny-cut-female-circumcision-in-south-east-asia) to severly harmful and therefore it is flawed to use this as an example of a harmful tradition here.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: False equivalence as rape is never a choice otherwise it wouldn't be rape.
1.6.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.6.2.4.5.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Historically, states \(usually run by men\) have paternalistically decided what is best for women. Therefore, the freedom to choose is a precious part of the feminist cause.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: Many opposed women securing the [right to vote](https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://en.wikipedia.org/&httpsredir=1&article=2748&context=lhapapers) because it "involves a kind of activity and responsibility for woman which is not compatible with her nature, and with her proper tasks in the world". \(p. 10\)
1.6.3.3.2. Pro: [Anti-abortion laws](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1336&context=honorstheses) are often motivated by wanting to help apparently misguided women who cannot be trusted to make the 'right' decision. In this way, women are deprived of choice over their own body. \(p. 12\)
1.6.3.4. Con: In many cases, these traditions involve other people \(usually men\) making choices for women.
1.6.3.4.1. Con: The most widely practiced harmful tradition genital mutilation, affects far more men than women.
1.6.3.4.2. Pro: Many widows have been [forcibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_\(practice\)) burned in the Sati tradition.
1.7. Pro: Some traditions are the result of our ancestors' ignorance.
1.7.1. Con: We should not immediately assume that traditions that originated in the past are the result of ignorance.
1.7.2. Con: Traditions based on ignorance are only a problem if they are harmful.
1.7.2.1. Con: Ignorance in general is not a desirable trait, so it is illogical to perpetuate it in whichever form it comes.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Many Native American [traditions](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-ceremonies/#Death%20Ceremonies) involving the [worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Dance) of nature or animals are "ignorant" of modern cosmology and physics, but that doesn't mean they should be banned.
1.7.3. Pro: Morals were different during their times. It is immoral to apply what they thought was right back at that time to today.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Slavery was considered to be moral.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Moral values tend to change over time.
1.8. Con: Banning certain traditions would create more dangerous divisions in society.
1.8.1. Pro: Banning certain traditions would create more tensions with religious fundamentalists.
1.8.1.1. Con: The difficulty in implementing a measure is not a reason not to do so if it is largely beneficial.
1.8.1.2. Con: This would be a good thing, as it would show fundamentalists that their views are incorrect.
1.8.2. Pro: Enforcing a ban on harmful traditions might be difficult, as many of them might take place in private homes. This means that the primary effect of the ban would be the antagonisation of those who practice it, pitting them against the state.
1.8.2.1. Pro: The most realistic way of determining whether a household is practising harmful traditions is by citizens in that community reporting it to the authorities. Having people tell on each other in this way in a community can cause great tensions within that community.
1.8.3. Con: These divisions may be a necessary consequence if society is to progress culturally and morally.
1.8.4. Con: Banning religious traditions is likely to [anger religious groups](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quebec-bill-21-lawsuit_n_5d08eed1e4b0f7b74426fb9a).
1.8.4.1. Pro: A ban in Belgium on religious [animal slaughter](https://www.neweurope.eu/article/belgian-ban-on-religious-animal-slaughter-angers-jewish-and-muslim-communities/) angered Jewish and Muslim communities.
1.8.4.2. Pro: This is likely to create instability in society.
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: Members of religious groups are likely to [protest](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/quebec-bans-religious-symbols/593998/) and riot.
1.9. Pro: Some traditions are harmful to society and go against all morals therefore they should be banned.
1.9.1. Con: Since morality arises out of cultural beliefs and traditions, tradition cannot logically conflict with the morals of someone within that cultural community.
1.9.1.1. Pro: A person's [moral identity is context-dependent](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00412/full) and tied to social and cultural obligations such as religious traditions and rites of passage.
1.9.1.2. Con: This is an unfairly deterministic conclusion; as empathetic, thinking, and autonomous agents, people can critically evaluate their cultural beliefs and traditions and adopt new morals that they can rationally justify better.
1.9.1.3. Con: Modern morality does not arise out of cultural beliefs but universalism and the respect for other's dignity as equal members of the human race.
1.9.2. Con: One must remember that although our morals go against it, the morals of that society might be different to ours and thus should be accepted.
1.9.3. Pro: [Scarification](https://coraminternational.org/themes/harmful-traditional-practices/) is the custom of making superficial incisions on one’s skin.
1.9.4. Pro: Child marriages are detrimental to the lives of children.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Sexual intercourse with children can be harmful for their bodies.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: In extreme circumstances, children may [die](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/3yearold-girl-dies-after-sexual-assault-abuse-police-say-stepfather-mother-charged/950513550) as a result of sex.
1.9.4.2. Pro: Having kids will make their lives difficult.
1.9.4.2.1. Pro: The kids are not ready to be parents.
1.9.4.2.2. Pro: The process of pregnancy and post-pregnancy complications could be detrimental for the wife.
1.10. Con: We could be mistaken in thinking that something causes harm when in fact it does not.
1.10.1. Pro: Some people think that the hijab is oppressive towards women, but most Muslim women claim to wear it out of their own [free choice](https://worldhijabday.com/shocking-poll-reveals-up-to-71-women-in-hijab-face-discrimination/) without being forced.
1.10.2. Pro: In an effort to reduce [bullying](https://www.edutopia.org/discussion/fall-dodgeball-why-schools-are-removing-competitive-elimination-games-their-pe-curriculum), many schools have removed dodgeball from PE classes, despite [inconclusive](https://globalnews.ca/news/5355416/dodgeball-bullying-children/) data as to whether this will actually make a substantial impact.
1.10.3. Con: There are also several clear examples of things that do cause harm.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Traditions that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights do not have a place in modern society.
1.11. Pro: Banning certain traditions would make the world a better and safer place to live.
1.11.1. Con: The backlash against the ban could make the world unsafer.
1.11.2. Pro: if we want our society to elvolve and be more peaceful, we must have respect for any life. This means that harm should be banned, even if it is a tradition. We have the right and the power to change the way we act, for a better world.
1.11.3. Pro: Banning unethical traditions would make the world as a whole more coherent.
1.12. Con: Harmful traditions will fade away naturally as people become better educated. Banning is not necessary.
1.12.1. Con: Americans became better educated from the [mid 19th century](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/S0968-8080%2807%2929303-6) but took on a new harmful tradition, that of the genital mutilation of boys.
1.12.2. Pro: Many [methods](https://allthatsinteresting.com/medieval-torture-devices) of torture and execution that used to be commonplace have disappeared from use as Enlightenment values have spread across societies.
1.12.3. Con: Banning can speed up this process and prevent unnecessary suffering.
1.12.3.1. Pro: While slavery may have eventually died out in the US, banning it ended the practice much more quickly.
1.13. Pro: Some traditional practices are inhumane.
1.13.1. Pro: [Female genital mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation) \(FGM\) is inhumane.
1.13.1.1. Con: It is not inhumane when a women decides to have [labiaplasty](https://www.verywellhealth.com/why-would-a-woman-get-a-labiaplasty-2709970), a type of FGM, but an expression of bodily autonomy.
1.13.2. Pro: [Child marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage) is inhumane.
1.14. Con: People should do whatever they want.
1.14.1. Con: In most societies people's freedoms are regulated when they collide with other's freedoms.
1.14.2. Con: There are traditions that harm humans even if they don't want to or force them to do what they don't want to do.
1.14.3. Pro: If the individual consents, that is their choice.
1.14.3.1. Con: Individuals following a tradition are usually not making a conscious choice.
1.14.3.1.1. Pro: Genital mutilation, for example, or circumcision are traditions practiced on minors, who do not have a say on what is done to their bodies.
1.14.3.1.2. Pro: Individuals tend to do what their community does or what their parents do without conscious thought.
1.14.4. Con: Governments limit people's choices when they harm themselves.
1.14.4.1. Pro: Attempted suicide is [illegal](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw2rKw1afjAhVEilwKHQ7RCVYQFjAAegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSuicide_legislation&usg=AOvVaw3ao4I1DjrIDBAmYFLDUuYt).
1.14.4.2. Pro: Consuming [hard drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs) is illegal in most countries.
1.15. Con: We should respect other people's religious views, and banning some of their traditions would be disrespectful.
1.15.1. Con: Human rights should prevail over religious views.
1.15.2. Pro: The Mawé People's tradition of the [bullet ant glove](https://allthatsinteresting.com/bullet-ant-glove) is harmful by most standards, but it is an important ritual in their culture.
