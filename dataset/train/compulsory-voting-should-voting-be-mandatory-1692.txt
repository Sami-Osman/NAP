Discussion Name: Compulsory Voting: Should Voting be Mandatory?

1. Citizens in democratic states should be required to vote.
1.1. Pro: Participation in the democratic process is a [moral duty](https://newrepublic.com/article/159690/yes-duty-vote-2020) and, therefore, should be enforced.
1.1.1. Pro: Citizens have a [moral duty](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2)(One suggestion \(Beerbohm 2012\) is that citizens have a duty to vote to avoid complicity with injustice. On this view, representatives act in the name of the citizens. Citizens count as partial authors of the law, even when the citizens do not vote or participate in government. Citizens who refuse to vote are thus complicit in allowing their representatives to commit injustice. Perhaps failure to resist injustice counts as kind of sponsorship. \(This theory thus implies that citizens do not merely have a duty to vote rather than abstain, but specifically have a duty to vote for candidates and policies that will reduce injustice.\)) to prevent their representatives from committing injustice by voting them out of office.
1.1.1.1. Con: Voting is not the only way to challenge unjust candidates. Political activism through protests and demonstrations have been proven to motivate change by making people more [politically active](https://qz.com/901411/political-protests-are-effective-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/)(Their research shows that protest does not work because big crowds send a signal to policy-makers—rather, it’s because protests get people politically activated.).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-protests-can-swing-elections)(From anti-war marches in the 1960s to the Tea Party rallies of 2010 and the almost nonstop progressive protests in 2018, marching in the streets has been a fixture of modern American life.\n\nBut do protests actually accomplish anything in terms of election results or the balance of party power?\n\nAbsolutely yes, according to a new study based on 30 years of data.) of the effects of 30 years of protests on US elections found that protests effectively sway public opinion.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Debates about effectiveness of protests to motivate change in response to political corruption are ongoing and inconclusive \([p. 1](https://knowledgehub.transparency.org/assets/uploads/helpdesk/Relationship-between-corruption-and-protest_2021.pdf)(From Bosnia Herzegovina to Ukraine, from Afghanistan to Tunisia, from South Sudan to Brazil, “popular outrage at governmental corruption is a common theme in political crises” \(St George’s House 2015\). Nonetheless, the relationship between corruption and popular protest is a nuanced one. First, academics contest the effect that perceptions of corruption have on citizens’ political action. While a substantial number of studies have argued that high levels of background corruption act as a catalyst for protest \(Beyerle 2014; Johnston 2005a\), others such as Peiffer and Alvarez \(2016\) have contended that widespread corruption actually reduces citizens’ political engagement.)\).
1.1.1.2. Con: Such a moral duty only exists so far as individuals actually believe that their representative is committing injustices.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: When voters fail to acknowledge injustice, they become complicit in it, which means that they are more morally responsible for it rather than less.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: If an individual's values are upheld by the actions of their representatives, then the principles of a [representative democracy](https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/representative-democracy/43508)(In a representative democracy, people generally vote for other people – representatives – rather than on legislative proposals directly. These representatives then formulate, propose, debate and vote on the laws and policies of our country. They’re supposed to do so in a manner they think we would be happy with. That is, they represent our interests. This unburdens us from having to brush up on the finer points of law and policy, and instead gives these responsibilities to someone whose job it is to be expert on these issues.) are upheld and there is no clear moral obligation to change.
1.1.1.3. Pro: It is commonplace in many modern democracies for representatives to enact [unjust policies](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/08/afghanistan-no-justice-thousands-civilians-killed-usnato-operations/)(The report documents in detail the failures of accountability for US military operations in Afghanistan. It calls on the Afghan government to ensure that accountability for unlawful civilian killings is guaranteed in any future bilateral security agreements signed with NATO and the United States.), regardless of their political affiliation, making it imperative for voters to take a stand against them.
1.1.2. Pro: Most citizens in modern democracies think there is some form of [moral obligation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#MoraObliVote)(Surveys show that most citizens in contemporary democracies believe there is some sort of moral obligation to vote \(Mackie 2010: 8–9\). Other surveys show most moral and political philosophers agree \(Schwitzgebel and Rust 2010\). They tend to believe that citizens have a duty to vote even when these citizens rightly believe their favored party or candidate has no serious chance of winning \(Campbell, Gurin, and Mill 1954: 195\).) to vote.
1.1.2.1. Con: Just because many or most people think voting is a moral duty does not render this proposition true.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Everyone should vote out of respect for those who fought for [universal](https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2019/05/14/what-is-suffrage/)(”Universal suffrage” was a term generally used to support the right to vote for all adults, regardless of race or gender. After 1870, when African American men secured the Federal right to vote with the 15th Amendment, the term “suffrage” became more commonly associated with the woman suffrage movement \(ca. 1848–1920\).) adult [suffrage](https://interactive.unwomen.org/multimedia/timeline/womenunite/en/index.html#/)(A single moment can spark a revolution, collective actions can transform laws, creative expression can change attitudes and an invention can alter the course of history. It’s these threads that weave together to propel the women’s movement — even in the face of obstacles. Discover how some of these strands, big and small, have shaped your lives, and the rights and lives of women and girls worldwide.).
1.1.3. Con: Voting should be considered a [right](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/studyguides/votingrights.html)(One of the most critical ways that individuals can influence governmental decision-making is through voting.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, recognizes the integral role that transparent and open elections play in ensuring the fundamental right to participatory government. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 21 states:\n\nEveryone has the right to take part in the government of his/her country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.), rather than a moral duty, because this recognizes and protects the right to abstain from voting.
1.1.3.1. Con: A lack of ideological diversity in political races could imply a lack of ideological diversity in the voting public about political issues.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: A lack of diversity of electoral choice is often inherent to political systems and is difficult to change.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Running in an election is [very time-consuming](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/the-cost-of-running-either-for-election-or-a-deficit-1.5323745/running-for-office-it-ll-cost-all-your-money-friends-and-free-time-1.5323781)(The challenges faced by candidates running for federal election — money, time, lost opportunities and more — are real barriers that few Canadians can afford to surmount, according to political strategists and alumni alike.) and expensive, making it difficult to maintain a job at the same time and thus locking out those who are less privileged.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: While there are many costs to running a political campaign, [experts claim](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/how-to-run-for-office-if-youre-not-rich)(So how can middle-income or low-income citizens run for public office? The road may be different than it is for wealthy, self-funded individuals, but it's not insurmountable.\n\nWe live in a political era of authenticity, experts say. "There's no reason to buy an entire new wardrobe because you've decided to run for office," Avella says. It's better to dress like yourself – as long as it's a clean, polished version of yourself, experts say.) that voters increasingly prefer genuine candidates with strong local support over candidates with an expensive look and a curated platform.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Candidates who self-fund their campaigns very [rarely win](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/03/self-funded-candidates/)(Let’s say you flip a coin, and it lands heads up. You flip it again, and it’s heads a second time. You toss it once more — you’re feeling exceptionally lucky — and it’s heads for the third time in a row. The chances of that happening are 12.5 percent.\n\nIn the 2016 cycle, that was precisely the likelihood of winning a federal race with a self-funded campaign.).
1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many candidates often end up [self-funding their campaigns](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topself.php?cycle=2016), particularly in the early stages of a campaign.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Many countries, like [Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/spd-green-party-fdp-cdu-left-party-afd/a-38085900), have vibrant and varied political cultures offering voters multiple options within ideological groups.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: It is better for democracy if the [majority](https://www.dictionary.com/e/majority-vs-plurality/)(Majority is a noun that in general means “the greater part or number; the number larger than half the total.” However, in terms of voting and elections, majority is defined as “a number of voters or votes, jurors, or others in agreement, constituting more than half of the total number.” It also refers to the party or group with the majority vote.), opposed to the [plurality](https://www.dictionary.com/e/majority-vs-plurality/)(Plurality is a noun that, like majority, can mean more than half of the whole. However when it comes to voting, plurality refers to “the excess of votes received by the leading candidate, in an election in which there are three or more candidates, over those received by the next candidate.” This means that someone who wins the plurality of votes received more than any of the other candidates but not necessarily the majority.), hold the same values.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Unlike a simple majority opinion, [pluralities](https://aceproject.org/main/english/bd/bda01a.htm)(Proponents of plurality electoral systems cite three main advantages--simplicity, stability, and constituency representation. The plurality system is easy to understand; voters simply place a mark next to their preferred candidate. The result of an election under the plurality system is also easy to understand; the candidate receiving the highest number of votes wins. This allocation rule is referred to as 'first past the post.'\n\nBecause of their tendency to produce a disproportionately large number of seats for the majority party, plurality systems usually produce strong single-party governments. This, in turn, produces a stable political system because there is no need to form coalition governments.) tend to create stable systems without relying upon loose coalitions between ideologically distinct groups.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: [Majority](https://aceproject.org/main/english/bd/bda01b.htm)(Proponents of majority electoral systems claim that these systems have all of the advantages of a plurality system, i.e., simplicity, stability, and constituency representation. A majority system is relatively easy for the voter to understand. It tends to produce strong and stable governments, and each territorial constituency is represented by a single legislator. An additional benefit of a majority system is that each representative has the support of a majority of his or her constituents.) systems guarantee that ruling political parties have the support of most of the voting population.
1.1.3.2. Con: It is unjust for [non-voters](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2)(A defender of a duty to vote might thus argue that non-voters free ride on voters. Non-voters benefit from the government that voters provide, but do not themselves help to provide government.) to benefit from a system that they have chosen not to participate in.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Citizens count as [partial authors](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#2)(One suggestion \(Beerbohm 2012\) is that citizens have a duty to vote to avoid complicity with injustice. On this view, representatives act in the name of the citizens. Citizens count as partial authors of the law, even when the citizens do not vote or participate in government. Citizens who refuse to vote are thus complicit in allowing their representatives to commit injustice.) of the law, even when they do not vote for the government.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: It is arguably more [irresponsible](https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/why-would-anyone-abstain-from-voting/)(From this point of view, it may seem better not to vote at all than to vote at random without understanding the consequences.) for one to vote when they do not understand the potential outcomes of their vote.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Laws are written in the name of citizens, and can have serious consequences on the lives of people. Citizens therefore have a responsibility to vote to ensure that no unjust or immoral laws are passed in their name.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Even without voting, people contribute to government revenue by paying taxes. Therefore, they are still entitled to the benefits of government.
1.1.3.3. Pro: The right not to vote has been recognized in [lower courts](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-right-vote-bulletproofing-course-action-before-you-burchart) in the US.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Members of Congress and the House of Representatives are given the option to [abstain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstention#International_and_national_parliamentary_procedures)(In the United States House of Representatives and many other legislatures, members may vote "present" rather than for or against a bill or resolution, which has the effect of an abstention.\n\nIn the United States Senate, the Presiding Officer calls each senator's name alphabetically, and, if abstaining, the senator must give a reason for the abstention. Members may decline to vote, in committee or on the floor, on any matter which he or she believes would be a conflict of interest.) from voting when unsure about a decision. These rights should be preserved for citizens as well.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: The US Supreme Court [has indicated](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-980) that the right to not vote is not inherent within the Constitution.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Votes are [formal](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/studyguides/votingrights.html)(Voting is a formal expression of preference for a candidate for office or for a proposed resolution of an issue.) declarations of support, which makes it especially important to protect the right to abstain from voting in cases where there are no representative options available.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: 27% of non-voters in the US are disappointed by the available candidates. This significant fraction would be forced to vote for candidates that they do not really support \([p. 9](https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-100-Million-Project_KF_Report_2020.pdf)(When non-voters who reported a lack of confidence were asked why they feel this way, the top\nreason given was a perception of elections being rigged or corrupt \(27%\), followed by issues with\nthe Electoral College and/or the popular vote not determining the outcome of presidential elections\n\(25%\).)\).
1.1.3.4.2. Con: Even if there are no ideal candidates running in an election, in cases where voters share beliefs or needs there will likely be some way to select a candidate that is more representative than others.
1.1.4. Con: Even if a citizen has a moral responsibility to vote, that does not mean that there should be a legally enforceable duty to vote.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Forcing reluctant people to vote would likely involve threatening citizens with punishment, which is an unjustified use of force from the state.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: It is misleading to claim that any use of force is immoral. Governments enforce all laws and policies through the [use of force](https://opentextbc.ca/ethicsinlawenforcement/chapter/2-9-social-contract-theory/) and some laws are morally justifiable.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Being reluctant to vote does not warrant legal punishment, which can have long-term consequences.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Mandatory voting systems, like the one in Australia, often issue [fines](https://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/Voters/I-didn-t-vote/Penalties-for-not-voting)(If you do not vote at a State or local government election and you don't have a valid reason, you will be fined $55. Apparent failure to vote notices are distributed within three months of an election event.) for failing to vote.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Laws should only restrict actions that directly violate the individual rights of others. Not voting does not limit anyone else’s rights.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: While abstaining from voting, in general, does not directly deprive others of rights, not voting in any election that impacts the rights of other people could lead to rights being limited.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: According to [libertarian political philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/libertarianism-politics/Libertarian-philosophy#ref234236)(Libertarians consider the rule of law to be a crucial underpinning of a free society. In its simplest form, this principle means that individuals should be governed by generally applicable and publicly known laws and not by the arbitrary decisions of kings, presidents, or bureaucrats. Such laws should protect the freedom of all individuals to pursue happiness in their own ways and should not aim at any particular result or outcome.), laws are justified when they protect individual liberties and the pursuit of happiness.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: This is an extremely narrow view of legal systems, which excludes any laws that protect the rights of groups, uphold national sovereignty, or promote goods that are unrelated to individual rights.
1.1.4.3. Con: Governments frequently take into account the morality of different actions when designing laws about them. If there is a moral duty to do something, then this may well naturally extend to a legal duty as well \([p. 112](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F1-4020-3505-5_36.pdf)(To sum up, legal doctrine is committed to\n• regarding social values as its genuinely normative basis;\n• regarding valid law as genuinely binding;\n• assuming there is a common core of values in society; and\n• assuming that a big part of the law reflects this common core.)\).
1.1.4.3.1. Con: While laws can be used to enforce good moral behavior, laws are also capable of promoting suffering and inequality.
1.1.4.4. Con: Without an enforced incentive to vote, a voting mandate would be little more than a suggestion.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Despite mandatory voting laws in some parts of [Austria](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout/compulsory-voting)(Not all laws are created to be enforced. Some laws are created to merely state the government's position regarding what the citizen's responsibility should be. Mandatory voting laws that do not include sanctions may fall into this category. Although a government may not enforce mandatory voting laws or even have formal sanctions in law for failing to vote, the law may have some effect upon the citizens. For example, in Austria voting is compulsory in only two regions, with sanctions being weakly enforced. However, these regions tend to have a higher turnout average than the national average.) being weakly enforced, voter turnout is higher than the national average, suggesting that mandatory voting laws may increase voter turnout even if they are not strictly enforced.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: [Costa Rica](https://stacker.com/stories/3485/countries-have-mandatory-voting)(While voting is legally required in Costa Rica, there are no fines or penalties in place for nonvoters. Voter turnout in the 2018 presidential election was 66%.)'s mandatory voting law is not strictly enforced, which resulted in only a 66% voter turnout in the 2018 election. This can be compared with the 53.4% voter turnout in the [US midterm](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html) elections in 2018.
1.1.4.5. Pro: Moral responsibilities like voting or being a good friend should not be considered legal duties because doing so could undermine the acts themselves.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: Friendship, like voting, depends on the voluntary consent of all parties involved. If one party is forced to participate against their will, then the friendship is compromised.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Forcing individuals to vote against their consent is immoral because it infringes upon their autonomy and undermines their place in society.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Con: Mandatory voting would not have the same effect on societal participation that mandatory friendship would have on social relationships, as voting and friendship are not analogous.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: Mandatory voting would not undermine the act of voting because voting involves the relationship between a person and a legal entity, like a government or society, which should not be compared with the social relationships between persons.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Enacting laws and enforcing them is how legal entities like governments incentivize some actions while disincentivizing others.
1.1.5. Pro: According to [utilitarian](https://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2009/04/legal-theory-lexicon-utilitarianism.html)(Utilitarianism is just one member of a more general family of moral theories, which we might call “consequentialist.” Consequentialism is the view that morality is about consequences of decisions.) legal arguments, it is morally right to require all citizens to vote if doing so creates the most good and least harm for everyone.
1.1.5.1. Con: Utilitarianism should not be used for political decisions, as it often [overlooks and justifies the neglect](https://pages.pomona.edu/~mjg14747/033-2006/RawlsUtilitarianism.shtml)(Rawls’s informal arguments come in the first part. He points out the conflicts between utilitarianism and most people’s beliefs about justice and fairness. He also offers an unflattering diagnosis of the appeal of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is appealing because it takes over the model of making decisions that individuals would make concerning their own lives. The problem with applying this model to a society is that those who suffer from sacrifices do not always reap the rewards. Those often go to someone else.) of significant concerns of small groups of people in a polity.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: This is only true in cases in which the interests of small groups do not align with the best outcomes for everyone involved, in which case it would be morally justifiable to ignore these concerns.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Utilitarianism is based on the assumption that the pleasure, pain, and utility of any action can be [calculated](https://www.britannica.com/topic/utilitarianism-philosophy#ref561303)(Bentham and Mill were hedonists; i.e, they analyzed happiness as a balance of pleasure over pain and believed that these feelings alone are of intrinsic value and disvalue. \n\nBentham believed that a hedonic calculus is theoretically possible. A moralist, he maintained, could sum up the units of pleasure and the units of pain for everyone likely to be affected, immediately and in the future, and could take the balance as a measure of the overall good or evil tendency of an action. Such precise measurement as Bentham envisioned is perhaps not essential, but it is nonetheless necessary for the utilitarian to make some interpersonal comparisons of the values of the effects of alternative courses of action.) for each individual person. Even if this were possible, it would fail to account for the needs of groups and communities.
1.1.5.2. Con: Individual votes have a negligible impact on the outcome of elections, which undermines utilitarian claims that voting is morally valuable.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The value of an individual vote decreases as the number of voters increase, which [substantially reduces](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#MoraObliVote)(Many popular arguments for a duty to vote rely upon the idea that individual votes make a significant difference. For instance, one might argue that that there is a duty to vote because there is a duty to protect oneself, a duty to help others, or to produce good government, or the like. However, these arguments face the problem, as discussed in section 1, that individual votes have vanishingly small instrumental value \(or disvalue\).) the moral obligation to vote once enough votes have been cast.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: The moral obligation to vote is not discharged when the impact of individual votes decrease because voting and other political acts are evaluated communally.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Even though voting rarely sways election outcomes, it is morally valuable because it reinforces good moral habits and cultivates an active political community.
1.1.5.2.3. Con: The value of each vote in a [close race](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#VotiChanOutc)(A more optimistic estimate in the literature, which uses statistical estimate techniques based on past elections, claims that in a typical presidential election, American voters have widely varying chances of being decisive depending on which state they vote in. This model still predicts that a typical vote in a “safe” states, like California, has a vanishingly small chance of making a difference, but suggests that that a vote in very close states could have on the order of a 1 in 10 million chance of breaking a tie \(Edlin, Gelman, and Kaplan 2007\). Thus, on both of these popular models, whether voting for the purpose of changing the outcome is rational depends upon the facts on the ground, including how close the election is and how significant the value difference is between the candidates.) is especially high, which creates a special obligation to vote in such elections.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Voting has the potential to generate more utility than other kinds of individual political action because [governments](https://www.britannica.com/topic/utilitarianism-philosophy/Effects-of-utilitarianism-in-other-fields)(In its political philosophy, utilitarianism bases the authority of government and the sanctity of individual rights upon their utility, thus providing an alternative to theories of natural law, natural rights, or social contract. What kind of government is best thus becomes a question of what kind of government has the best consequences—an assessment that requires factual premises regarding human nature and behaviour.) with strong support are better equipped to pass laws that benefit large groups of people.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Governments generate [moral utility](https://web.uncg.edu/dcl/courses/vicecrime/m7/The%20Utilitarian%20Theory%20of%20Punishment.htm)(Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. \n\nThe principle of utility recognizes this subjection, and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law. Systems which attempt to question it, deal in sounds instead of sense, in caprice instead of reason, in darkness instead of light.\n\nThe business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding.) through a commitment to maximize the well-being and pleasure of their citizens and prevent as much pain as possible.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: While it may be morally obligatory to vote for and support a government that will bring about the best outcome for everyone, there should be no obligation to support a government with unclear or immoral values because of the potential for harm and abuse it could cause.
1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: While governments have more power than individuals to create morally good outcomes, they also have more power to create and uphold immoral outcomes.
1.1.5.3.2.2. Con: In both cases, it would remain morally obligatory to vote because it is morally important to support good candidates and vote against bad candidates.
1.1.5.4. Pro: In addition to deciding the outcome of elections, votes also impact the [mandate](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#VotiChanMand)(One popular response to the paradox of voting is to posit that voters are not trying to determine who wins, but instead trying to change the “mandate” the elected candidate receives. The assumption here is that an elected official’s efficacy—i.e., her ability to get things done in office—depends in part on how large of a majority vote she received. If that were true, I might vote for what I expect to be the winning candidate in order to increase her mandate, or vote against the expected winner to reduce her mandate. The virtue of the mandate hypothesis, if it were true, is that it could explain why it would be rational to vote even in elections where one candidate enjoys a massive lead coming into the election.) - or perceived power and confidence - of elected officials, which suggests that voting is important even if there is little chance of winning.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: Political scientists have tested for the effects of a political [mandate](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#VotiChanMand)(One popular response to the paradox of voting is to posit that voters are not trying to determine who wins, but instead trying to change the “mandate” the elected candidate receives. The assumption here is that an elected official’s efficacy—i.e., her ability to get things done in office—depends in part on how large of a majority vote she received. If that were true, I might vote for what I expect to be the winning candidate in order to increase her mandate, or vote against the expected winner to reduce her mandate. The virtue of the mandate hypothesis, if it were true, is that it could explain why it would be rational to vote even in elections where one candidate enjoys a massive lead coming into the election.) and found that candidates are not impacted by the margin of victory in elections they win.
1.1.5.4.2. Pro: There are likely [indirect benefits](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/26/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democratic-party-donors)(Nationwide, many other primary challengers have attempted to unseat Democratic incumbents they say are milquetoast or bought off by corporate donors. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, many have lost their primary bids. If we think short-term, those candidates failed.\n\nBut if we think long-term, those progressive challengers have paved the way for future wins. Dozens of progressive challengers have already filed to run against Democratic congressional incumbents in 2020. Many more are challenging incumbents at the city and state level. It is too soon to say how those challengers will fare, or what effect they will have on Democrats’ chances of regaining power in the immediate term.) of expanding the margin of victory in an election, such as increasing the confidence of potential investors, reassuring political allies, and creating new opportunities for good press.
1.2. Con: Making voting mandatory would expand the power of political elites and existing governments.
1.2.1. Pro: Mandatory voting may give new, long-term advantages to special interest groups and major parties, thereby entrenching their power to a greater extent.
1.2.1.1. Con: Special interest groups are not always a bad thing. They are also used to promote medicine and scientific research as well as the goals of civil rights movements.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Space agencies, like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), are considered special interest groups. They use their power to get support for scientific research.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: NASA gets its funding from the [US government](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)(The U.S. government funds NASA using federal revenue from income, corporate, and other taxes. The budget also provides incentives for private businesses to partner with the government on space station operations, deep-space exploration, and small satellite groups. NASA has funded 23 research concepts with $7 million to further space technologies.), meaning that it must lobby to be included in economic stimulus packages, like the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009](https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/recovery.html)(The purpose of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is to promote economic recovery, create or save jobs, spur technological advances in science and health, and invest in infrastructure that will provide long-term benefits. NASA, as a recipient of Recovery Act funds, has an important role to play in achieving the Act's goals -- and will do so through the program and facilities investments. In this regard, the Recovery Act provides $1 billion in appropriations for NASA programs and facilities, including $400 million for science-related appropriations, $150 million for aeronautics research, $400 million for the space exploration, and $50 million to restore NASA-owned facilities damaged by natural disasters. Appropriations in this Act are available for obligation through the end of fiscal year 2010. NASA intends to spend this funding with full transparency and accountability.), in order to pursue its scientific missions.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: While NASA's mission is good for mankind, it is, in general, important to limit the political power of major organizations to ensure that they continue serving their citizens.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Civil rights groups engage in [lobbying](https://www.aclu.org/lobbying-decisionmakers-ii)(Ethical lobbying is the only kind of lobbying we aim to discuss here. \n\nJust to clarify: We're not talking about payoffs, bribes, under-the-table favors, kickbacks, cronyism, sweetheart deals, or tit-for-tat arrangements, either expressed or implied. We're certainly not talking about expensive lunches, even inexpensive gifts. Nor are we talking about paid lobbyists, who can be as ethical as anyone, but who lobby for a living and operate on a different level. \n\nRather we're talking about smokeless, no-frills, citizen-based lobbying, where you attempt to persuade largely on the merits of your position. We mean occasions when you attempt to persuade a decision-maker that your position, A, has more value than an opposing position, B, or other positions, C, D, and E; because if A is chosen, the overall benefits for the community \(and perhaps for the decision-maker, too\) will be the greatest.) to push policymakers to ensure that concerns for the well-being of discriminated groups are represented in the halls of government.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: A system where special interest groups have great influence is inevitably one where the [richest political actors](https://academy4sc.org/video/interest-groups-influencing-politics/)(Many have criticized America’s interest groups system, saying that large, well-funded interest groups have too much sway over politics and elections. Critics argue that these interest groups, usually associated with a corporation, use their money to buy politicians and decide their vote. While it is illegal to pay a politician directly for their vote, it is legal for a corporation to donate thousands of dollars to a political campaign, and that donation can imply political support from that candidate. For instance, the NRA spends millions on lobbying but spends far more on supporting candidates’ campaigns.) are able to buy the most influence. This is very anti-democratic.
1.2.1.1.4. Con: Special interest groups often take over and polarize political discussions by eliminating options that are not in their best interests.
1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Large corporations in the USA use lobbying to significantly [reduce their tax burden](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issues/special-interests/)(Thirty corporations spent $476 million to lobby Congress over three recent years. Their investment paid off: They dodged $68 billion in federal taxes.), making it especially hard for politicians to pass amibitious policies contingent on higher taxes.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Compulsory voting makes elections more predictable, allowing parties with the greatest resources to target swing or marginal seats with greater ease \([p. 17](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/file/2017/04/Ballinger-on-Compulsory-Voting-2006.pdf)(Compulsory voting, by taking out of the political equation the guesswork\nsurrounding turnout, makes target seats - and key voter groups within those marginal seats - even easier to identify.)\).
1.2.1.2.1. Con: With mandatory voting, parties may have an incentive to democratize more internally, which could increase party diversity and ensure that parties are listening to all of their constituents.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: With more views being represented within politics, parties may seek to have a greater number of perspectives in their ranks, to help more people identify with them.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Political parties are often [led by elites](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00345.x)(Our interview data indicate that \(i\) governmental actors and various interest groups have relatively more influence in shaping local agendas than the general public, experts, and election-related actors, while the mass media are found to have little agenda-setting power in local policy processes; \(ii\) budgetary consideration and various forms of feedback to local government are more important than objective problem indicators and focusing events in setting local policy priorities; \(iii\) policy alternatives that are deemed compatible with existing policies and regulations are more likely to be selected than those relying on other criteria such as technical feasibility, value acceptability, and future constraints; and \(iv\) consensus and coalition building is perceived as the most important political factor in local policy processes.) who determine the range of acceptable and reasonable ideas. Such elites are fairly insulated from popular opinion and will retain that power with mandatory voting \([p. 444](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14742837.2019.1577133)(Cooptation is the elite strategy of using apparently cooperative practices to absorb those who seek change – to make them work with elites without giving them any new advantages \(Selznick, 1949, p. 34; Gamson, 1975, p. 29; Piven & Cloward, 1977, p. 30\). When cooptation is successful, those who seek change alter their positions when working with elites, hoping to gain new strategic advantages through compromising, but those advantages do not come and instead the elites’ position prevails. In contrast to violent suppression, cooptation may accomplish the goals of the elites without significant political or financial cost. The ultimate consequence is that the challengers become politically irrelevant.)\).
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Analysis of Australia's governmental spending indicates that legislation related to close political races receives more funding than initiatives in safe political strongholds \([p. 17](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/file/2017/04/Ballinger-on-Compulsory-Voting-2006.pdf)(Chong, Davidson, and Fry cite research showing that, in Australia, government spending on key policy programmes was higher in marginal electorates than in safer electorates.)\).
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: This is especially problematic because it disproportionately harms the Aboriginal electorate, which is often ignored in federal elections because Aboriginal people are not concentrated enough to swing most elections \([p. 17](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/file/2017/04/Ballinger-on-Compulsory-Voting-2006.pdf)(Moreover, because of the small proportion of Aboriginal electors in most federal constituencies \(except\nfor one seat – Lingiari – in which they form 37.2 per cent of the electorate\) Aboriginal issues are rarely central to Australian federal election campaigns.)\).
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: While compulsory voting does not eliminate incentives for favoring close races over safe ones, it does reduce the difference in value of each vote when compared to voluntary voting systems \([pp. 17-18](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/file/2017/04/Ballinger-on-Compulsory-Voting-2006.pdf)(Making turnout compulsory does not, therefore, ensure citizens will have an equal chance of influencing an election result, because it cannot guarantee that each vote. Arend Lijphart concludes that, ‘Compulsory turnout cannot solve the entire conflict between the ideals of participation and equality, but by making participation as equal as possible, it is a valuable partial solution.)\).
1.2.1.3. Con: With mandatory voting, the power of citizens, relative to that of interest groups, would increase, making politicians less dependent on lobbying to win.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Politicians often accept lobbying money when they are unable to raise campaign funds from [supporters](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5949581/money-in-politics-charts-explain)(The Internet age allows candidates to raise significant sums from small donors. Yet, for presidential candidates from both major parties, larger contributions remain more important. In 2012, President Obama raised only 28% of his campaign funds from donors who gave less than $200 overall, and Romney raised merely 12% from those donors. Both candidates got more of their money from donors giving at least $1,000 — in Romney’s case, much more. Obama got 39% of his funds from those donors, and Romney got 66%.). With a greater number of voters, they may be less reliant on lobbyist money.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: With mandatory voting, campaigns may need greater funds to reach new demographics while maintaing the same focus on existing areas. As such, that may make them more reliant on lobbyist funds.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: To reach more voters, parties will have to spend more on [leaflets](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/general-election-leaflets-campaign-spending)(By the time of the 2015 general election, political parties’ aggregate spending on unsolicited material had grown to over £15 million out of a total spend of £37 million – by far the largest category. The same year, parties reported to have spent just £1.7 million in payments to Facebook, Google and Twitter.), online advertisements and trips to a greater number of locations within a constituency.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: The fact that lobbyist funds would be spent to reach new demographics of potential voters demonstrates how mandatory voting could shift the money in politics to address the needs and interests of citizens.
1.2.2. Con: Mandatory voting could lead to greater support for smaller political parties, thereby shifting power away from entrenched political elites and distributing political power more evenly.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Otherwise apathetic voters, who dislike the biggest parties, may opt to vote for smaller parties under mandatory voting.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: People often opt against voting for small parties because they worry that their vote would be '[wasted](https://www.gaconstitutionparty.org/are_votes_on_third_parties_wasted)(Most people see votes on third parties as wasted votes, perhaps even worse than useless. The general assumption is, if a third party candidate has no chance of winning, then it is foolish to lower the chances of the next-best, big-party candidate. Voting for a lesser-of-two-evils candidate who can win would be better than voting for an ideal candidate who will lose.)' if they do not vote for the parties most likely to win. This would still exist under mandatory voting.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Dissatisfied voters may not care about wasting their vote, and therefore may vote for niche or single-issue parties that represent some of their frustrations.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Many entrenched non-voters distrust, not merely large parties, but [the political system as a whole](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/)(That sense that the candidates are too flawed to be worth voting for — or that the system is rigged, or can’t be fixed by voting — came up in many of our conversations with survey respondents.). As such, they are more likely to submit empty ballots than support small parties.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Minor parties in Australia have benefited from compulsory voting and are big supporters of it \([p. 8](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.488.1436&rep=rep1&type=pdf)(On the other hand, Australia’s minor parties are obvious beneficiaries and keen supporters of CV, since they provide an alternative for voters dissatisfied with Australia’s major parties, but nonetheless legally compelled to vote.)\).
1.2.2.2. Pro: Countries with effectively [two-party systems](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-party/Two-party-systems#ref36670)(Another form of the two-party system is operative in Great Britain and in New Zealand. The situation in Australia is affected somewhat by the presence of a third party, the Nationals \(formerly the Australian Country Party\). A tight alliance between the Nationals and the National Party of Australia introduces, however, a rather rigid bipolarization with the Labour Party. The system thus tends to operate on a two-party basis. Canada also possesses what is essentially a two-party system: Liberals or Conservatives have usually been able to form a working majority without the help of small, regionally based parties.) - like the [US](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-party/Two-party-systems#ref36669)(The United States has always had a two-party system, first in the opposition between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists and then in the competition between the Republicans and the Democrats. There have been frequent third-party movements in the history of the country, but they have always failed.), the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - are often ruled by two dominant parties, despite being comprised of many distinct political parties, organizations, and interest groups.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Small and niche parties or movements still have a great deal of influence in such countries, as they can drastically change public opinion \([p. 417](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/AEF265EED2CAA81C35A3808F47F5908A/S0007123414000155a.pdf/niche-party-success-and-mainstream-party-policy-shifts-how-green-and-radical-right-parties-differ-in-their-impact.pdf)(Analyzing time-series cross-section data for sixteen Western European countries from 1980 to 2011, this article empirically establishes that green and radical right parties differ in their effect on mainstream party behavior and that their impact depends on the ideological position and past electoral performance of the mainstream parties.)\).
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Small parties often still succeed in [non-general elections](https://www.democraticaudit.com/2019/09/05/why-do-niche-parties-perform-so-well-in-european-and-subnational-elections/)(The recent European elections saw a range of small, single-issue parties perform exceptionally well. In the United Kingdom, the Brexit Party received 30.7% of the votes. In Germany, the Green Party made remarkable gains, winning 20.5% of the votes. Green parties also performed well in countries such as France, Sweden and Finland, as did anti-immigration far-right parties. Although these strong results may be viewed as inevitable consequences of fragmenting party systems linked to the growing importance of issues such as climate change, immigration and national pride in public debate, these results in fact fit a longstanding pattern: single-issue parties – sometimes referred to as ‘niche parties’ – tend to receive higher vote shares in European and subnational elections \(so called ‘second-order elections’\) than in preceding and subsequent national elections.), which still gives them large platforms.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: The two-party system in the US [forces multiple groups](http://observer.com/2016/05/the-primaries-arent-rigged-but-the-two-party-system-is/)(Although the current two party system has been in place for over 150 years with few real threats to its dominance, it is apparent that both parties have for most of this time been unwieldy coalitions of groups and interests that are not natural allies. For example, the fundamentalist Christians and pro-business anti-tax advocates who make up two of the largest groups of voters in the GOP have few shared interests or priorities. The same can be said for African Americans and white liberals, two of the largest groups of voters in the Democratic coalition.) to align with each other despite their differences, which could be avoided if these groups could align with smaller parties to reach new voters.
1.2.2.2.4. Pro: In Uruguay, mandatory voting has been enforced since 1970. Since then, the country has evolved from a strong two-party system into a [multiparty](https://freedomhouse.org/country/uruguay/freedom-world/2021)(Uruguay’s multiparty system is open and competitive. The major political groupings are the Colorado Party, the Frente Amplio coalition, the Independent Party, and the Partido Nacional \(also known as Blanco\). The Partido Nacional, accompanied by its coalition partners, took power in early 2020.) system.
1.2.2.3. Con: Even if it is the case that mandatory voting increases the relative power of smaller parties, that may produce greater hurdles for the successful representation of voters.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Despite political negotiations often taking time, the end result is often collaboration and compromise between parties, which should increase representation overall.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: In political systems with many minor parties, it can be difficult to reach clear majorities. If mandatory voting increases the power of smaller parties, it could, therefore, impede the efficacy of government.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Con: Coalition governments made up of several political parties held together through compromise are a good thing for democracy because they make majorities depend on political representation.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Belgium's parliament has [more than 10](http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/belgium.html) different parties. After the 2010 elections, given the difficulty of generating sufficient alliances, the country went [8 months](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/belgium-ndash-eight-months-with-no-government-2213128.html) without forming a government.
1.2.2.4. Con: Many countries have an electoral threshold to access parliament. Thus, small parties would still struggle to gain access to power.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Some of these thresholds can be fairly [high](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/barriers-to-entry-how-do-electoral-thresholds-work/)(The exact level at which the threshold is set varies from country to country. The lowest is in the Netherlands, where a party has to win just 0.67% of the vote nationally to win a seat, and the highest is currently Turkey’s 10% ‘mega-threshold’ \(though there are currently plans to reduce this\). Most electoral thresholds are, however, somewhere between 3 and 5%.). Even if a large number of small parties emerge with mandatory voting, they will not necessarily pass the threshold.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: Even if smaller parties do not reach the threshold, they may receive more support under mandatory voting and thus garner more attention, making them more likely to receive votes later on.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: Some small parties may be able to act as ['spolier' parties](https://electionscience.org/library/the-spoiler-effect/)(In election parlance, a spoiler is a non-winning candidate whose presence on the ballot affects which candidate wins. In mathematical terms, the spoiler effect is when a voting method exhibits failure of a property known as independence of irrelevant alternatives.), taking voters away from more established parties. Therefore, those smaller parties do not need to gain seats to have influence.
1.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: Parties close to the threshold may still be invited to leadership debates or will be included in predictions regarding the election results.
1.2.2.4.2.3. Con: Without parliamentary seats, even influential small parties are often [ignored or maligned](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/12/05/when-are-green-parties-successful/)(However, the increasing political prominence of the Greens is not distributed equally. The figure below displays the marked variation in Green electoral success rates across advanced European democracies from the 1980s to the present. While these parties have gradually expanded out from their West-Central European heartlands, in some countries – for example, the relatively diverse polities of Norway, Spain, and Poland – they remain fundamentally obscure and inconsequential electoral players.), especially when their demands cannot be conveniently placated.
1.2.3. Con: Compulsory voting reduces corruption from elected officials.
1.2.3.1. Con: Low voter turnout is often a sign of corrupt elections or [dissatisfaction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2016.1223677?journalCode=fbep20)(The findings show that perceiving corruption negatively affects turnout, but only in countries with low to medium levels of system corruption.) with a corrupt system. Compulsory voting would remove this vital indicator.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Transparency International uses the Corruption Perception Index \(CPI\) to evaluate election corruption based on indicators like bribery, the diversion of public funds, and political nepotism, none of which depend on voter turnout \([p. 2](https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/2020_CPI_FAQs_ENv2.pdf)(Which manifestations of corruption does the CPI capture? \nCPI source data captures the following aspects of corruption:\n• Bribery \n• Diversion of public funds \n• Prevalence of officials using public office for private gain without facing \nconsequences \n• Meritocratic versus nepotistic appointments in the civil service \n• Effective criminal prosecution for corrupt officials \n• Legal protection for whistleblowers, journalists, investigators when they are \nreporting cases of bribery and corruption \n• Access of civil society to information on public affairs)\).
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: It is more difficult to track and identify invalid or random ballots that have been submitted as a form of protest.
1.2.3.2. Pro: More robust forms of democracy, often associated with higher turnout, tend to have lower levels of corruption \([p. 2](https://bseim.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9932/2019/09/Final2ManuscriptCorruption.pdf)(Using Varieties of Democracy data, we examine 173 countries from 1900 to 2015, and we find freedom of expression and freedom of association each exhibit an inverted curvilinear relationship with corruption—both overall corruption and four different types. The introduction of elections and the quality of elections each act in a linear fashion—positively and negatively with corruption, respectively—but jointly form a curvilinear relationship with both overall corruption and many of its types.)\).
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Countries with mandatory voting tend to have [lower rankings](https://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2016/03/15/does-compulsory-voting-increase-or-decrease-corruption-preliminary-thoughts/)(The political scientist Sarah Birch found that countries with compulsory voting have better scores on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index) in corruption perception indexes.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Despite voting being compulsory in Brazil, it still has [high levels of corruption](https://nacla.org/news/2019/06/17/brazil-corruption-mode-rule)(Bolsonaro’s stunning victory last year was in part based upon the myth that military rule had been less corrupt than civilian rule, and that Bolsonaro could restore those values that had degenerated under the corrupt influence of “communist” PT rule. Yet, far from being an innovation of the PT, political corruption has long been imbricated in the fabric of Brazilian politics. Its persistence is not peculiar to Brazilian culture or national morality. Rather, it has been a central instrument in securing the Brazilian elites’ hold over political and economic power for centuries.).
1.2.3.3. Con: Mandatory voting will not necessarily lead to people voting against corrupt candidates.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: In systems with a small number of parties, where all engage in some form of lobbying or corruption, voters may be [forced to continue](https://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/10/sachs-corporatocracy-is-replacing-democracy.html)(America is losing its democracy as our politicians trade their votes for campaign contributions from the corporate lobbies. We have a corporatocracy rather than a democracy \[...\].) to support such candidates.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Voters are often willing to overlook corruption committed by politicians they support \([p. 420](https://www.ippri.unesp.br/Modulos/Noticias/129/jcpo45-4_wintersweitzshapiro.pdf)(Whereas the information hypothesis proposes that voters return corrupt politicians to office because they are unaware of corruption, the tradeoff hypothesis posits that voters knowingly elect corrupt politicians when those politicians provide voters with other benefits. In other words, voters make a strategic decision to overlook corruption because politicians deliver in other ways. The consequences of corruption for political support will thus depend on a politician’s overall performance.)\).
1.2.3.3.3. Con: Often, those who are most disgusted by corruption end up disengaging from politics \([pp. 21-22](https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/DP8790.pdf)(The main contribution of this article it to provide experimental evidence that information about political corruption influences voters’ electoral decisions beyond their evaluations of the incumbent. We show that exposing rampant corruption leads to incumbents’ vote loses, but it also leads to a decrease in electoral turnout, and a decrease in challengers’ votes. Furthermore, exposure of corruption weakens partisan identification with the corrupt incumbent’s party, and increases share of voters who do not identify with a political party. Thus, under some circumstances, information about corruption disengages voters from the political process.)\). If voting is made compulsory, they may be likely to vote against corrupt candidates.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that a group of disaffected non-voters would have a large impact on the results of an election.
1.2.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Disengagement can be caused by many factors and is not a predictive indicator of voting behavior.
1.2.3.3.3.1.2. Con: Given that voting rates hover around [50% in many countries,](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/voter-turnout-by-country) compulsory voting would almost double the electorate, dramatically impacting the composition of the government.
1.2.3.3.3.1.3. Con: While this may be true of national elections, smaller regional and local elections could be greatly influenced by an influx of more voters.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: The lowest social classes are hurt the most by corruption and are also those with the lowest electoral participation \([p. 6](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/23098/1/Compulsory_voting\(LSERO\).pdf)(The fact that lower turnout means increasingly unequal turnout is troubling, because those least likely to turn out are overwhelmingly drawn from the least privileged social groups in a polity. Thus, the IPPR report notes that though ‘socio-economic status - whether measured by income, class or education – is not as significant a factor as age in determining whether a person will vote or not, it has nevertheless become an increasingly\nsignificant factor – at least in the UK. ....although there has been some decline in turnout among all income categories since 1964, the decline is most rapid for those with the lowest income’.)\). Mandatory voting would mobilize those citizens to vote against corruption .
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: It can be very hard to identify corrupt officials or parties and vote them out of office.
1.2.3.3.4.1. Con: This is an argument to improve political education among voters, rather than to shy away from compulsory voting.
1.2.3.3.4.2. Pro: Corruption scandals often emerge a long time after the initial acts of corruption were committed.
1.2.3.3.4.2.1. Con: Even if it takes a while for the details of corruption to emerge, it still often forces politicians to [resign](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-did-owen-paterson-do-b1952077.html)(Boris Johnson’s government is mired in sleaze claims after No 10 tried to save Conservative Party MP Owen Paterson from suspension while seeking to rip up the Commons disciplinary process.\n\nOn Thursday Mr Paterson dramatically resigned as an MP after Mr Johnson U-turned and allowed a fresh vote on his suspension over a breach in lobbying rules, and retreated on plans to rewrite conduct rules.), indicating that there are still democratic consequences for corruption.
1.2.3.3.4.2.2. Pro: Political [scandals](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/political-scandal-a-theory/)(While the private actions of politicians may cause voters to scratch their heads in wonder, the transformation of misbehavior into public scandal should not surprise them, as this process is deeply political. In other words, bad behavior is not a scandal on its own, but only after it is exposed, and that exposition is always a choice weighed against the political costs and benefits of respective political parties.) tend to lag behind corrupt political actions because it often takes time to discover and expose the private actions of politicians.
1.2.3.3.4.2.3. Pro: The events of the Petrobras scandal that led to the the initiation of [Operation Car Wash](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/brazil-operation-car-wash-is-this-the-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-history)(Launched in March 2014, the operation had initially focused on agents known as doleiros \(black market money dealers\), who used small businesses, such as petrol stations and car washes, to launder the profits of crime. But police soon realised they were on to something bigger when they discovered that the doleiros were working on behalf of an executive at Petrobras, Paulo Roberto Costa, the director of refining and supply. This link led prosecutors to uncover a vast and extraordinarily intricate web of corruption.) in 2014 date back as [early as 2004](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=9bc05ca3-dd94-4257-ae9a-0508f3b8038d)(According to the NPA and the SEC Order, between 2004 and 2012, Petrobras executives and managers \(the “corrupt officials”\) executed a bribery scheme that allowed a cartel of contractors and suppliers to rig bids and unfairly obtain Petrobras contracts at inflated prices, and simultaneously allowed Petrobras to curry favor with Brazilian politicians and political parties.).
1.2.3.3.4.3. Pro: Many forms of political corruption are hidden from the public. Politicians often seek to make [legal changes](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/02/28/polands-hidden-corruption/)(For example, the amendment to the civil service law in 2016 resulted in the removal of all barriers to putting party figures in the top positions in ministries. As a result, the ruling party has complete freedom in filling more than three thousand key administrative posts.) to hide such mundane forms of corruption.
1.2.3.4. Pro: When compulsory voting is strongly enforced, corrupt activities like vote buying and turnout buying become more difficult because the cost of buying an election goes up as the number of voters increases \([p. 21](https://www.scinapse.io/papers/2122765552#fullText)(Given that voting has been compulsory in Argentina since 1914, it might be hard to see how turnout buying would be relevant in this context. However, as Canton and Jorrat \(2003, 199\) argue in their study on abstention in Argentine elections, “compulsory voting is not particularly enforced\nany more.”)\).
1.2.3.4.1. Con: [Research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24363494?seq=1)(Our analysis yields numerous insights, such as why the introduction of compulsory voting may increase vote buying, and why enhanced ballot secrecy may increase turnout buying and abstention buying.) points out that mandatory voting actually increases vote buying and can increase turnout buying and abstention buying without legal safeguards.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: While electoral corruption in Brazil was not addressed by compulsory voting alone, increased judicial oversight and public engagement paired with mandatory voting has reduced corruption \([p. 1](https://robobees.seas.harvard.edu/files/ruling_politics/files/nichter_-_vote_buying_in_brazil_-_from_impunity_to_prosecution.pdf)(Politicians often buy votes with impunity. Despite formal laws against vote buying, Brazil rarely prosecuted politicians for this common practice. What explains a recent and dramatic shift? In the late 1990s, over one million Brazilians signed a petition against vote buying, leading to the country’s first law by popular initiative \(Law 9840\). Under this law, nearly 700 politicians have been removed from office for vote buying. This study examines how civil society and the judiciary played an instrumental role in both enacting and implementing Law 9840.)\).
1.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: Evidence from Mexico suggests that turnout buying systematically varies with monitoring capacity and can be clearly exploited \([p. 40](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jmarshall/files/turnout_buying_mexico.pdf)(Our evidence that turnout buying systematically varies with monitoring capacity in Mexico has clear implications for countries across Africa, East Asia and Latin America where “party machines” remain strong.)\).
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: As the number of people voting increases, the number of votes needed to win with a majority also increases.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Thailand introduced compulsory voting in 1997, precisely to reduce vote buying and corruption \([p. 2](https://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf)(Compulsory voting has\nbeen introduced in a variety of contexts to address a range of problems, from low turnout in Belgium in 1893 to electoral corruption in Thailand over a century later in 1997.)\).
1.2.3.4.4. Con: Mandatory voting systems may incentivize vote selling as apathetic voters could earn money for elections that they do not care about.
1.2.4. Con: Compulsory voting could be combined with measures, like those used in Portugal, where, if a minimum of votes are blank, the election must be repeated with new candidates. This allows citizens to express frustration without expanding elite power.
1.2.5. Pro: Incumbent parties that support compulsory voting often do so to cement and strengthen their power \([p. 34](https://www.gretchenhelmke.com/uploads/7/0/3/2/70329843/helmke_and_meguid.pdf)(Multivariate analyses based on our original dataset reveal both that parties on the Right were more likely to adopt CV, and that they were especially likely to do so when\nthey were faced with a strengthening Left. Moreover, just as the flip side of our theory predicts, we find consistent statistical support for the view that non-Rightist parties were less likely to turn to CV when the Left’s efforts to get out the vote were successful. Qualitative evidence based on three out-of-sample cases supplements our statistical results and provides direct support for the\ncore mechanism in our story. Across remarkably different historical contexts, we find the same\ngeneral pattern: the Right adopted compulsory voting as the Left’s electoral fortunes waxed.\nDirect historical evidence further underscores that the Right indeed viewed compulsory voting\nexplicitly as a strategy for countering the superior mobilization capacity of the opposition.)\).
1.2.5.1. Pro: Australia has one of the highest levels of [party identification](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0199240566.001.0001/acprof-9780199240562-chapter-13)(Placed in a comparative perspective, the hallmark of Australian politics is the dominance of party: the vast majority of voters identify with and vote for one of the major political parties, and gaining election at the federal level is next to impossible without the benefit of one of three party labels \(Liberal, National, or Labour\). Within the legislature, party government operates in every sense of the word, with parties determining the legislative agenda and enforcing rigid discipline among their members. Perhaps more interestingly from a comparative perspective, Australia has seen little decline in the strength of the major parties in recent years, in contrast to Britain, the US, or many of the other advanced democracies.) in the world due to its mandatory voting system, suggesting that major parties can become entrenched in a mandatory system.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Parties may seek to implement mandatory voting during periods where their support is dropping, thereby enticing supporters they may have lost to continue voting for them.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Such attempts will only work in a small number of cases, as the implementation of mandatory voting would likely also benefit the opposition parties that incumbents hope to beat.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: It is often incumbent parties who [lose greater shares](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/10/09/historically-the-presidents-party-performs-poorly-in-the-midterms-infographic/) of votes when voters are unsatisfied. As such, if they are able to recoup some of those votes with mandatory voting, they will likely see bigger gains than their oppositions.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Pro: Non-voters often have significantly [different views](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/) from the major parties. Therefore, they are especially unlikely to vote for incumbents when forced to vote.
1.2.5.2.2. Pro: In Australia, the [Labor Party](https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/beyond-turnout-consequences-compulsory-voting)(Politics and party competition has also played a role in the adoption of compulsory voting. In both Belgium and Greece, some members of the upper class saw compulsory voting as a method of preventing outsized influence of the working class. In Australia, the incumbent Labor Party supported compulsory voting as a way to ensure that turnout among their supporters would match that of supporters of the better-funded Liberal-National Coalition. Meanwhile, the Coalition supported compulsory voting as a way to lessen the need for voter mobilisation campaigns, thus freeing up resources for other endeavours.) advocated for mandatory voting in order to succeed against political opponents with more funding.
1.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: A study of compulsory voting in Australia \(implemented in 1924\) estimates that when voting was voluntary, only 44% of voters supported Labor. However, when voting became mandatory, 78% of previous non-voters supported Labor \([p. 25](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1)\).
1.2.5.2.2.1.1. Con: This could be explained by other causes increasing overall support for Labor, like their offering more popular policies or facing more disliked opponents.
1.2.5.2.2.2. Con: The Australian Labor Party continued to support compulsory voting in opposition, even though, by this logic, they would suffer as a result.
1.2.5.3. Con: Even if parties support implementing mandatory voting to reap electoral rewards, those benefits will likely be short-lived. The overall system, in the long-run, will be improved.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Over time, the power balance between parties will shift due to changes in voters' evaluations. The benefit that comes from implementing mandatory voting can only, then, last for a few electoral cycles.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: Even if temporary, parties that are able to win large amounts of support may be able to harm the quality of democracy in their countries.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: Parties can, and often do, win [supermajorities](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/13/787705261/boris-johnson-and-conservative-party-win-large-majority-in-parliament)(The Conservatives now have an 80-seat majority after snaring 365 seats in the 650-seat chamber, giving Johnson a firm mandate. The opposition Labour Party suffered its worst defeat in more than 80 years, losing 59 seats.) in voluntary systems. As such, this worry is not unique to mandatory voting.
1.2.5.3.2.2. Pro: Parties who are able to artificially cement and increase their power can pursue [constitutional changes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21748878)(The Hungarian parliament has approved a controversial set of amendments to the country's new constitution.\n\nSome of the amendments include provisions that have previously been deemed unconstitutional by the country's Constitutional Court.\n\nCritics say that they will strengthen the power of the state, further cementing the governing conservative Fidesz party's position in public institutions, and damaging democracy by removing a number of checks and balances.) that make them or their ideas harder to expel from politics.
1.3. Pro: Under mandatory voting, politicians would be better representatives of the interests and views of voters.
1.3.1. Con: Mandatory voting would incentivize political parties to adopt electoral strategies that make them less representative of the interests and views of voters.
1.3.1.1. Pro: With compulsory voting, parties can adopt strategies aiming to beat their opposition while not seeking to meaningfully represent the people.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Given the difficulty of appealing to the interests of a larger voting population, it may be easier for politicians to focus on [negative campaigning](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/why-negative-campaigning-works-and-how-fight-it)(The beauty of negative attacks — from a campaign standpoint — is that they influence everyone. Even a candidate’s supporters will be affected by negative attacks, Ledgerwood and her collaborators have found. Once a negative idea has been planted, it’s very hard to shake.) than on the various needs of their potential voters.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Often, negative campaigning seeks not to diminish support for other parties, but rather to make voters [less willing to vote](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434246/donald-trump-targeted-dark-facebook-ads-black-voters)(the campaign is meanwhile attempting to depress votes in demographics where Hillary Clinton is winning by wide margins.) all together. This will not be possible under mandatory voting.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Mandatory voting will make the electorate sufficiently large and diverse such that it will be impossible for one party to provide meaningful representation to all their voters.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Candidates will still have to persuade voters by promising to enact better policies than their opponents.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.1.
1.3.1.1.4. Con: This is the result of bad electoral systems, not compulsory voting. Alternative electoral systems, like [proportional representation](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/23/21075960/polarization-parties-ranked-choice-voting-proportional-representation)(The way out is to replace our current two-party system with a system that represents the true diversity of Americans — a multiparty system that’s more fluid and responsive to Americans’ political preferences and that dissolves our binary partisanship.\n\nTo get there, we need to change the way we elect our representatives. Instead of holding elections in congressional districts where the single candidate who gets the most votes wins, we need to move toward a proportional representation system, currently used in many advanced democracies. In such a system, if a party gets 40 percent of the vote in a state, then 40 percent of that state’s congressional delegation will represent that party — straightforward and intuitive.), may give politicians greater incentives to meaningfully represent the people.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Electorates often have [short memories](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-looking-back-four-years-voters-have-short-memories/)(These two back-to-back election cycles represent the most emphatic examples of a point that macroeconomic forecasting models are absolutely agreed upon: it’s recent economic performance that matters.), meaning they tend to vote on the basis of the most recent issues and often fail to hold political parties accountable for their shortcomings.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: It is not uncommon for voters to re-elect politicians who have [behaved undemocratically](https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/11/study-americans-prize-party-loyalty-over-democratic-principles)(The study, published in the American Political Science Review, found that only 3.5% of U.S. voters would cast ballots against their preferred candidates as punishment for undemocratic behavior, such as supporting gerrymandering, disenfranchisement, or press restrictions.) or otherwise violated voters' trust.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: [Some studies](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/01/06/when-evaluating-a-presidents-economic-performance-voters-look-across-their-entire-record-not-just-the-recent-short-term/)(Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence that voters are only concerned about the short term.) have refuted this, indicating that voters do care about long-term factors, like economic performance across several years, when making voting decisions.
1.3.1.3. Con: [Governments](http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_and_inequality_how_populists_mislead_people)(Indeed, Trump and many other populist leaders regularly make a connection between a “corrupt elite” interested only in enriching themselves and their \(rich\) supporters and the marginalisation of “working people”.) already tend to serve the interests of economic elites. Mandatory voting could pressure governments to listen to the needs of other demographic groups.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Evidence from Austria [shows](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272716301487) that the introduction of compulsory voting has little to no effect on government spending patterns or electoral outcomes.
1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: In Australia, conservative parties shifted to more progressive policies when large numbers of working-class voters were forced to vote \([p. 28](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=1)(In just a three year span, the majority party made a clear turn toward progressive domestic policies, and the introduction of more working class voters into the electorate and increased presence of the Labor Party may have provided impetus for such a change.)\).
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Ethnic minority citizens often get [overlooked](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2018/09/britain-s-eight-million-ethnic-minorities-are-still-being-ignored-over) in important political decisions and are especially likely to not turnout in elections. With compulsory voting, they will gain greater power.
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Individuals living in poverty rarely vote, which leads politicians to [ignore](https://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9388045/2014-voter-turnout-redistribution)(But deep differences in turnout based on income, age, and race only serve to further reduce the poor’s say. In the status quo, politicians don’t have incentives to listen to ordinary Americans, because it won’t cost them anything. That won’t change until turnout among nonwhite and poor voters increases.) their interests. Mandatory voting would give these populations greater electoral power, incentivizing parties to seek their votes.
1.3.1.3.4. Con: There are better alternatives to stopping elite control over politics, like campaign finance reforms.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: Reforming campaign finance regulations would enable politicians to be successful [without needing huge amounts](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why-germany-s-politics-are-much-saner-cheaper-and-nicer-than-ours/280081/)(And for the entire election season, even the larger campaigns of main parties, like the SPD or Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, cost somewhere between 20 and 30 million euros -- and again, that’s the total for everyone from Chancellor Angela Merkel to the most junior parliamentarians, combined. Meanwhile, a single U.S. Senate seat now costs an average of $10.5 million to win, and Obama’s reelection campaign alone cost $700 million) of money to campaign, making them less dependent on rich donors.
1.3.1.3.4.2. Con: Parties in the UK, where [campaign rules are very strict](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2021-0121/), are still accused of being elitist and out of touch.
1.3.1.4. Con: Minority votes are often suppressed by political parties. Mandatory voting may force political parties to stop suppressing and begin appealing to marginalized populations.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Given how successful [voter suppression](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/analysis-voter-suppression-never-went-away-tactics-changed/)(Non-Hispanic white people are a shrinking percentage of the U.S. population and won’t be a majority within a few decades. They’ve held on to grossly disproportionate political power and wealth through discriminatory tactics that go back hundreds of years. As that power is threatened in 2020 by demographic shifts and backlash to a deeply unpopular president, the effort to rule from the minority for a long time to come has become more desperate and more brazen.) has been at delaying demographic power shifts, mandatory voting would likely change, rather than eliminate, how voter suppression is carried out.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: In India, the right-wing BJP openly vowed to disenfranchise [Muslim voters](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-politics-idUSKCN0WC2WR)(Yet, after a heavy defeat last autumn in Bihar, the BJP has pursued a more confrontational line. It has promoted the idea that India is a Hindu nation and rounded on “anti-national” opponents, in what critics say is an attempt to marginalize minority Muslims.) because they perceived them to be a threat to Hindu Nationalism. Such sentiments are unlikely to change in a mandatory voting system.
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: Voluntary voting may incentivize parties to spend resources to discourage the opponent's supporters from voting. A mandatory voting system could encourage politicians to educate and encourage voters instead.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: At several points in modern US history, [Republican](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/10/republicans_are_already_suppressing_minority_votes_all_over_america.html)(Voters attempting to cast an early ballot are being thwarted and lied to by Republican officials—a problem that will likely escalate into chaos on election day. This crisis is not unexpected; indeed, it’s been carefully planned by Republican politicians since the turn of this century.) officials have attempted to block African American citizens - a group statistically more likely to [vote against](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/07/republican-voter-suppression-policy-stop-the-steal)(And the policy behind it was aggressive voter suppression, targeting people of color, urbanites, low-income communities and other groups whose full participation in future elections is seen by Republicans as a threat.) the party - from registering to vote.
1.3.1.4.2.2. Con: Voter turnout is usually decided by long-term trends, like overall trust in the government and how [competitive](https://www.fairvote.org/what_affects_voter_turnout_rates)(One of the most important factors is the competitiveness of the presidential election in each state. 69% of voters in the ten most competitive states cast a ballot in 2020, compared to the national average of 66%.) voters see an election as being. This suggests that attempts to discourage voters is not a big enough problem to warrant mandatory voting.
1.3.1.4.2.3. Pro: As Donald Trump was unable to broaden his base due to his extreme policies, his campaign sought to [persuade](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434246/donald-trump-targeted-dark-facebook-ads-black-voters)(In one move, the Trump campaign reportedly created a cartoon animation with Clinton repeating her now-infamous line about "super predators," pairing it with the text, "Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators." Businessweek reports that the Trump campaign is planning to use the ad in so-called "dark" Facebook posts — targeted, paid posts — to convince black voters not to come out for Election Day.\n\nCertainly there's nothing new about political ads trashing an opponent — but using Facebook to target the opposition's supporters is a different strategy. As Businessweek points out, there's no widely available evidence that such a plan will work. It may even backfire, unintentionally convincing some Americans to vote instead. But as the magazine writes, the data the Trump campaign has built may be the foundation for a Trump project launching well past Election Day.) potential Clinton voters to stay at home.
1.3.2. Pro: If all citizens are required to vote, there will be an incentive for politicians to appeal to the largest group of people, and thus be more moderate.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Without compulsory voting, there is a greater incentive for parties to appeal to voters who most strongly share their political ideology.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: India's compulsory voting system often involves [vote banking politics](https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/how-political-parties-have-relied-on-votebank-politics-ahead-of-polls/53726)(Votebank \(also spelled vote-bank or vote bank\), in the political discourse of India, is a term referring to a loyal bloc of voters from a single community, who consistently back a certain candidate or political formation in democratic elections. Such behavior is often the result of an expectation of benefits, whether real or imagined, from the political formations, often at the cost of other communities. Votebank politics is the practice of creating and maintaining votebanks through divisive policies. As it encourages voting on the basis of self-interest of certain groups, often against their better judgement, it is considered harmful to the principles of representative democracy.), where political parties make deals with targeted groups of potential voters in exchange for all of their votes. In response to the harms this causes, India's Supreme Court [banned](http://www.timesnow.tv/india/article/how-political-parties-have-relied-on-votebank-politics-ahead-of-polls/53726)(The Supreme Court today ruled that politicians cannot use caste, greed or identity of certain groups to garner votes ahead of crucial polls.\n\nThe seven judge bench voted 4-3 in the favour of not allowing political parties to use the voters' religion during the campaigns, citing that there is no use of religion in politics.) vote banking on the basis of caste, creed, or religion.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: More ideologically extreme voters tend to be a lot more excited and thus more likely to vote, meaning they get more influence in selecting a party's candidate.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Radicalized voters and figures may still influence others if voting is compulsory as they tend to be the most active on [social media](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2019/far-right-groups-shout-the-loudest-on-social-media/)(Right-wing populists dominate the political discourse on social media platforms in Europe far more than their voter share would suggest, according to a study by the Spanish data analysis company Alto. The data from Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Poland – and exclusive to “Investigate Europe” – show that small parties succeed in attracting attention on Facebook or Twitter by systematically using the mechanisms of these platforms.) and are given additional media coverage.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: Given how important ideological similarities are for voters, mandatory voting systems are unlikely to change how political parties attract potential voters.
1.3.2.2. Con: More moderate policies are not necessarily more representative of people's interests and views.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Moderate policies often reinforce political systems and resist change, making radical policies necessary to force political systems to adapt to the changing needs and interests of the people.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: [The New Deal](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/great-depression-and-world-war-ii-1929-1945/franklin-delano-roosevelt-and-the-new-deal/) in the US was considered by many to be a radical solution to the Great Depression, yet it is now considered an important and momentous legislative accomplishment.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: While radical policies and coalitions can be useful for overcoming major challenges, they are often merely important first steps to the development of more [stable](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-system/Stable-political-systems)(The simplest definition of a stable political system is one that survives through crises without internal warfare.\n\nIn some systems, survival does not depend on the detailed management of the society or close governmental control over social processes but is the result of sensitive political response to the forces of change, of flexible adjustment of the structures of the system to meet the pressures of innovation, and of open political processes that allow gradual and orderly development. Much of the Western democratic world has achieved peaceful progress in this way, despite new political philosophies, population increases, industrial and technological innovations, and many other social and economic stresses.) and moderate systems.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: In countries, like India, that have large and incredibly diverse populations, a middle ground for policies that involve the entire population is often unachievable \([p. 75](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi173/classesandreading/decolonization_and_india1/democ__aut_-_pp.66-77.pdf)(Mobilizing ever larger segments of the unprivileged strata without the will or the ability to actuate qualitative changes in their socioeconomic predicament was redefining politics in ways which severely tested the institutional capacities of a centralized state structure. It was the disjunction between state posturing from above and multiple social changes below that created the conditions for personalized rule and the politics of deinstitutionalization.)\).
1.3.2.2.1.4. Con: Radical politicians tend to realize their aims without considering potential consequences, whereas [moderate politicians](https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-moderate-politician-four-key-tests-122079)(Thirdly, moderate candidates talk moderately. They accept that there are limitations to what can and should be said. This is not pussyfooting around or being overly politically correct. If you dehumanise sections of the electorate you not only cut them off for voting for you, but in believing in the democratic process at all – and that has consequences.) are typically more restrained.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Which policies are considered 'moderate' is often a product of the priorities of existing parties. However, these concerns often [do not reflect](https://pnhp.org/news/two-thirds-of-voters-support-providing-medicare-to-every-american/)(Sixty-nine percent of registered voters in the April 19-20 survey support providing Medicare to every American, just down 1 percentage point from an Oct. 19-20, 2018 poll, and within the poll’s margin of error.) the views of people.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: Parties who are willing to find the middle ground and compromise between each other make it such that more voters can have some form of representation, even when their favored party loses.
1.3.2.3. Pro: In elections with lower turnout, ideologically fervent and passionate voters, who often reliably vote, have a greater ability to sway elections.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: A [2008 Pew Research](http://www.people-press.org/2012/11/01/nonvoters-who-they-are-what-they-think/) study showed that non-voters roughly align with voters on most issues. This indicates that the incentives for politicians will not change all that much under mandatory voting.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: In systems with [low voter turnout](https://www.vox.com/2015/9/24/9388045/2014-voter-turnout-redistribution)(This has a real impact on who we elect. Americans who vote are different from those who don’t. Voters are older, richer, and whiter than nonvoters, in part because Americans lack a constitutional right to vote and the various restrictions on voting tend to disproportionately impact the less privileged. In 2014, turnout among those ages 18 to 24 with family incomes below $30,000 was 12 percent. Turnout among those older than 65 and making more than $150,000 was 65 percent. The result is policy that is biased in favor of the affluent.), smaller ideological portions of the population receive disproportional representation by dictating policy and electing officials who share their ideology.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: In many countries, younger [generations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk1)("Now we are seeing, not just twenty somethings, but people in their 30s and 40s who have never voted and who actually seem proud to say so. This is something that greatly concerns me.) tend to vote less regularly, yet they are not necessarily more moderate. As such, increasing their turnout will not likely increase moderation.
1.3.2.4. Con: Even with optional voting, politicians will target the largest groups in order to get the most votes. That is why, in most democracies, no extreme parties are in charge \([p. 1](https://www.andrewbenjaminhall.com/Hall_Thompson_Base_Turnout.pdf)(\[W\]e find that extremist nominees — as measured by the mix of campaign contributions they receive — suffer electorally, largely because they decrease their party’s share of turnout in the general election, skewing the electorate towards their opponent’s party.)\).
1.3.2.5. Con: A 2020 study has found that compulsory voting has improved the ability of populists to get elected, which suggests that compulsory voting may create new opportunities for political radicalization rather than moderation \([p. 1](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=273099104103086082067102095081071023035071009020021045096001006098083105067096095075028001097122048126037065113100119015099125046045033089029066018097095117102110029050052113016029098066088072030071091011111001120122101087024115067105100023005120026&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)(We present a study showing a high use of such laws in the region as a method to elect populist leaders and maintain their control of government, and conclude that a continuation of the populist trend elsewhere is likely to be associated with more compulsory voting laws.)\).
1.3.3. Pro: Low voter turnout is extremely harmful for major democracies as it undermines the ability of governments to accurately represent their people.
1.3.3.1. Pro: [Voter turnout](https://theconversation.com/global-voter-turnout-has-been-in-decline-since-the-1960s-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-167775)(Any democratic nation in the world holding a legislative or presidential election in the late 1960s could expect around 77% of its citizens to turn up to vote. These days, they can expect more like 67% – a decline that is both problematic and puzzling.) is low and declining among many democratic countries. Compulsory voting would prevent this.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Electoral participation is decreasing among all voters in the [US](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/10/economist-explains-24)(UNLIKE presidential contests, America’s mid-term elections do not seem to inspire many people. In 2012 fully 59% of registered voters turned up at the polls for the presidential election. But two years earlier just 42% bothered to cast their votes in the 2010 mid-term elections, and this year’s turnout may be even lower.) and the UK \([p. 35](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=sei-working-paper-no-92.pdf&site=266)(Whilst overall electoral turnout began to recover in 2005 from the nadir of 2001, amongst the youngest cohorts, Britain’s newest and future citizens, the decline in turnout continued. This poses important questions for future policy debates on social exclusion and the nature and functioning of\nrepresentative democracy in Britain.)\). This is especially true of younger voters.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Evidence suggests that people's voting habits are often [formed in their youth](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2012.718280?journalCode=fbep20)(Tracing individuals for more than 30 years of their lives, the long-term effect of early voting experiences on people's turnout profiles is also examined. The findings show early voting experiences shape future voting profiles.), meaning that if young voters do not vote now, their turnout is unlikely to increase without intervention.
1.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Even at its highest for 40 years, the eligible voter turnout for presidential elections in the United States was only [66.7%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#Turnout_statistics) in 2020.
1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: The US youth vote, while lower than the voting rate for all age groups, [has not actually decreased significantly more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_vote_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Voting_Trends_by_Race_and_Age.jpg) than the overall voter turnout has.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: In systems with mandatory voting, many people choose to protest the laws by submitting blank or spoiled [ballots](https://voxeu.org/article/compulsory-voting-turnout-and-government-spending)(Consistent with the hypothesis that compulsory voting might increase turnout by drawing uninterested voters to the polls, we find that compulsory voting led to a rise in the proportion of invalid ballots,). As such, these votes are meaningless and should not count as political engagement.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: Void or cancelled ballots are not invalid to the democratic process; they may highlight where important issues are not being represented.
1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Due to the nature of [single-winner plurality contests](https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2018/9/17/17870478/two-party-system-electoral-reform), abstaining from voting is often an implicit vote for the winner - since it makes it harder for other candidates to beat the frontrunner - and, as such, does not effectively convey this protest.
1.3.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Protest votes are more powerful statements of dissatisfaction than not casting a ballot as they are easier to quantify. A significant number of protest votes sends a clear message that many people feel that there is no viable [candidate or party](https://www.votenone.org.uk/protest_votes_count.html)(In the 2015 General Election, the UK total of 'rejected' or 'spoilt' votes was almost 100k. \(97,870 to be exact.\) That is a huge number. It's equivalent to the votes for 3 or 4 MPs, given that most MPs are elected on 18k to 28k votes.\n\nBut across the country, it represents less than 1% of votes. So it was not news. Meanwhile, 34% of registered voters \(nearly 16 million!\) just didn't vote.\n\nGoal: If just some of those non-voters will Vote for what they believe in, the results of the election can change.) to vote for.
1.3.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Even if blank or spoiled ballots were able to register frustrations successfully, many voters may just opt to vote for bigger parties to ensure they are able to [sway the overall result](https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/tactical-voting/)(For a tactical voter, voting pragmatically for a ‘lesser evil’ candidate is justifiable on the grounds it will block a ‘more evil’ option. Ultimately, tactical voters fear an idealistic vote might gift an election to a ‘more unpopular’ candidate.\n\nUtilitarian by nature, a tactical voter opts for candidate that is not ‘perfect’ but clearly better than another candidate whom they wish to block.\n\nVoting tactically is an important part of Britain’s ‘First-Past-The-Post’ \(FPTP\) electoral system. To win a constituency, a candidate needs a plurality of votes \(simply more votes than anyone else\).).
1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: An individual could choose to [donkey vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_vote)(In electoral systems which use ranked voting, a donkey vote is a cast ballot where the voter ranks the candidates based on the order they appear on the ballot itself. The voter that votes in this manner is referred to as a donkey voter.\n...\nDonkey votes are most common where preference voting is combined with compulsory voting, such as in Australia, particularly where all candidates must be ranked on the ballot paper. There are different versions of the phenomenon applicable in the Parliament of Australia and in the Australian jurisdictions that use the Hare–Clark electoral system.) in a ranked voting system by ranking politicians based entirely on the order their names appear on the ballot.
1.3.3.1.2.2.1. Con: This could be easily solved by randomizing the placement order of candidates on individual ballots.
1.3.3.1.2.3. Pro: Despite voting being compulsory in Australia, approximately [6% of voters place informal votes](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-04/informal-votes-to-have-impact-on-election-result-in-close-seats/7566232)(The Australian Electoral Commission \(AEC\) said 11 million votes were counted on polling day, with the rate of informal voting on the House of Representatives ballot paper about 5 per cent, down from 5.9 per cent in 2013.\n\nA ballot that has not been completed properly is considered an informal vote by the AEC and not counted towards any candidate.) which impact election outcomes in close races.
1.3.3.1.2.3.1. Con: Having just 6% of votes being blank or spoiled would still imply a [significant increase](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/election-results-2019/en/turnout/) in voter turnout for most European countries, which have around 65% voter participation on average.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: In the EU, countries with mandatory voting tend to have higher turnout levels than those who do not \([p. 3](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf)\).
1.3.3.1.4. Con: Many countries that have mandatory voting do not enforce it, meaning that they end up with voter turnout rates that are closer to the averages in similar countries.
1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: Despite technically having mandatory voting, Greece has comparatively low voter turnout rates, hovering around the mid-50% region for the last two parliamentary elections in [2019 and 2015](https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/85/)(Greek Parliament 2019 - 57.91%\nGreek Parliament 2015 - 56.57%).
1.3.3.1.4.2. Con: Even if mandatory voting is not closely enforced, it may still act as a '[nudge](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/690711)(It uses survey evidence to show that mandatory voting can help the large majority of American citizens who believe they should vote to do so, thereby functioning as a precommitment mechanism. For the minority who do not think they should vote, mandatory voting functions as a nudge to surveillance, which helps citizens protect their interests, whatever they may be, through encouraging surveillance of political actors. The argument concludes that mandatory voting would make all citizens better off by their own lights and without troubling coercion.)' since more people will see themselves as having a responsibility to vote, thereby increasing turnout.
1.3.3.1.4.3. Pro: Many countries with mandatory voting still make expemptions for specific groups. For example, voting in [Brazil](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1866802X0900100105)(However, there are several reasons why the exemption for illiterates is often viewed as innocuous in Brazil. One is that illiterates were denied suffrage until 1985, so one might expect a surge of participation after the democratic transition. Another reason is the elusive definition of what actually constitutes literacy.) is not mandatory for those who are illiterate.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1. Con: Making exceptions to a rule for individuals who are incapable of abiding by it is not the same thing as failing to enforce a rule.
1.3.3.1.5. Pro: In much of Europe and North America, when older [voters](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk1)(With voting rates highest among older voters, he said the situation was likely to get worse as time went on unless action was taken to stem the decline.\n\n"My fear is that as the older, more regular voters die, we will be left with a significant number of people for whom voting is neither a habit, nor a duty," Mr Hoon said.) die, participation may diminish to even lower extremes.
1.3.3.2. Con: Low voter turnout does not prohibit democracies from representing their people.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: The current system of voluntary voting in the US allowed one of the [most unpopular candidates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/21/the-last-presidential-candidate-who-was-as-unpopular-as-donald-trump-david-duke/?utm_term=.2f78503954cb), Donald Trump, to win the 2016 presidential election.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: The peculiarities inherent in the [Electoral College](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about)(The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.) are particular to the US and are not representative of voluntary voting systems on the whole.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, despite receiving [fewer votes](http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/eligible-voter-turnout-for-2016-data-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-republican-democrat-popular-vote-registered-results/)(Based on data from The Associated Press and the New York Times, Clinton received 65.84 million votes, or 48.1 percent of the total popular vote. Trump received 62.97 million votes, or 46.0 percent. But since Trump earned victories in Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, he easily won the electoral college with 306 votes. Clinton beat Trump by nearly 3 million votes in the popular vote.) than his leading rival.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Voting regularly is a very clear way for voters to send elected leaders signals about their wishes and worries. With low turnout, politicians can only guess their preferences.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: The signals sent to political leaders as a result of elections could be contradictory and hard to interpret in a generalizable way.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: Through [referenda and elections at different levels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0261379495000569)(Barometer elections are defined as elections that reflect changes in citizens' attitudes toward the government in response to changing political and economic conditions, absent the opportunity to install a new executive. We classify British by-elections and German Land elections as barometer elections and test a general model that incorporates the electoral cycle; public opinion toward the government; economic conditions; and previous performance as determinants of election outcomes.), incumbent politicians can make judgements as to what policy changes they must do to remain popular and in office.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Higher voter turnout does not always make governments more representative because the [quality of votes](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Compulsory-Voting-Rules%2C-Reluctant-Voters-and-Dassonneville-Feitosa/f8dd589d2a16037ed3014399f7b10bfc3cbae86b)(Our results support the ‘reluctant voter’ hypothesis: Compelling voters to vote tends to weaken the impact of proximity considerations on electoral behaviour, although this effect remains limited and is only significant in half of the elections that were investigated.) can decrease, meaning that voters are often less informed, interested, and consistent when they are forced to vote \([p. 28](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/614665/1/compulsory%20correct%20voting_manuscript_final.pdf)(A safe conclusion therefore\nmight be that compulsory voting has a tendency to reduce ideological congruence in voting, but\nthat this effect remains limited. Compulsory voting apparently entails a price with regard to the\nquality of the vote, but in this analysis, this effect is borderline significant, and this low level of\nsignificance might explain why the evidence that was presented in earlier studies is mixed. In half\nof the cases we find significant results, in the other half we do not)\)
1.3.3.2.4. Pro: Election turnout has decreased in most G20 democracies since 1945, from around 80% to 60%. Yet, the legitimacy of these elections has not decreased \([p. 1](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf)(The trend lines show that voter turnout has been on a consistently downward path at elections, both within the Euro-\npean Union and in the United States. Indeed, these trends are consisent with a general decline in turnout at elections in\nmost G20 democracies since 1945 – from around 80% in the immediate post-war period to just over 60% today.)\).
1.3.3.2.4.1. Con: In many of these countries, as turnout has fallen, there has been a slowly building '[crisis of representation](https://www.idea.int/news-media/news/crisis-representation)(While more countries than ever conduct elections and democracy takes roots in new parts of the world, there is a parallel phenomenon of decreasing voter turnout, voter apathy, decreasing party membership, and the rise of populist movements in various parts of the world. We have seen that these movements create stiff competition to traditional political parties, defying their structures, ways of organizing, mobilizing, financing, expressing themselves and connecting to citizens. Disenchantment with traditional politics, entrenched corrupt practices, and the growing gap between political representatives and ordinary citizens, lies at the heart of their raison d’ȇtre.)', meaning fewer people believe in the legitimacy of their governments.
1.3.3.2.4.2. Pro: While many claims have been made that election results in the US are [illegitimate](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-49a24edd6d10888dbad61689c24b05a5)(Trump’s allegations of massive voting fraud have been refuted by a variety of judges, state election officials and an arm of his own administration’s Homeland Security Department. Many of his campaign’s lawsuits across the country have been thrown out of court.), they have all been found to be false.
1.3.3.2.4.2.1. Con: The fact that right-wing groups in the US made false claims about the legitimacy of an election does not address other problems of legitimacy, like the declining voter turnout rate.
1.3.3.2.4.2.2. Pro: Trump and his supporters have argued that Biden's victory in 2020 was the result of [widespread corruption](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-ap-fact-check-joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-49a24edd6d10888dbad61689c24b05a5)(TRUMP: “I go from winning by a lot to losing a tight race. It’s corrupt.”\n\nTHE FACTS: No mass corruption happened. Trump is actually describing a legitimate vote counting process, not a sudden surge of malfeasance that no one has seen before.), yet no evidence has been found to support these claims.
1.3.3.3. Con: Given that people will be forced to vote, increased turnout will not impact the legitimacy of the political system.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Even if they are forced to vote, voters may feel a kind of association or identification with the parties they vote for.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: If people feel that their vote has been coerced, they may become more [resentful](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/03/politics.voterapathy)(Once in the private booth, many will no doubt mark their displeasure at their enforced presence by spoiling their ballot in some way.) of the political system as a whole.
1.3.3.4. Pro: One impact of decreased voting rates in many European countries is the rise in the influence of [radical nationalist parties](https://time.com/4504010/europe-politics-swing-right/)(Across the once placid political landscape of Western Europe, right-wing upstarts have created what Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, recently termed “galloping populism.” He was referring to movements like the Sweden Democrats, the National Front in France, the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands and other voices on the far right calling for their once open countries to close up and turn inward.), which have gained disproportionate power in many governments.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: Elections that have lower turnouts tend to favour incumbent candidates, which suggests that healthy political systems are resilient to radical ideologies even when voter turnout is low \([p. 2](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/jtrounstine/low_turnout_UAR_RR.pdf)(Current office holders at all levels of government seek and win reelection at high rates. City councilors, like their counterparts in state legislatures and in Congress, benefit from this incumbency advantage \(Trounstine 2011\). This may be a sign of a healthy democracy. Constituents, pleased with the experience and performance of their representatives, reward elected officials with additional terms of office.)\).
1.3.3.4.1.1. Con: While incumbents have historically held their offices against ideological challengers, there is no reason to assume that this trend will continue as radical ideologies gain popularity.
1.3.3.4.1.2. Pro: Between 1982 and 2006, around [95%](http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/rdrenka/ps103/Spring2010/congressional_incumbency.htm)(Success of congressional incumbents has become something of a half-funny joke recently. These are the figures for those Representatives who sought reelection in the 13 biennial national elections for 435 U.S. House seats from 1982 through 2006: 95.17% of incumbents who sought reelection were successful.) of incumbents who sought re-election in the US House of Representatives were re-elected despite relatively low voter turnout.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: In [Belgium](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/belgium-workers-party-wallonia-ceta-eu/), where voting is compulsory, there is no such swing to the extreme right. In fact, it is rather the left that has gained ground.
1.3.3.4.3. Pro: Some of the European countries with the lowest turnouts in general elections - like [Hungary](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/11532818/Hungarys-far-Right-anti-Semitic-Jobbik-party-wins-its-first-by-election.html) or Poland \([p. 2](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf)\) - are also the ones where the [far-right](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-the-center-right-co-opts-the-far-right-in-austria/) has achieved the best results.
1.3.3.4.4. Con: Both Austria and the Netherlands have very high turnouts \(74.9% and 74.6% respectively - [p. 2](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140739/LDM_BRI\(2014\)140739_REV1_EN.pdf)\) and both have seen a similar [rise](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-the-center-right-co-opts-the-far-right-in-austria/)(The Austrian case is instructive because the governing People’s Party \(ÖVP\) under the leadership of 33-year-old Sebastian Kurz has started co-opting the anti-Muslim \(and anti-immigration\) agenda of the Austrian Freedom Party \(FPÖ\). Here, we have a nominally centrist-right rather than a radical right-wing party \(like the League in Italy\), which plays a central role in the implementation of anti-Muslim positions.) in the popularity of nationalist parties.
1.3.4. Con: Many people vote for irrational or arbitrary reasons, making their votes unrepresentative of their own interests. This increases the odds that unqualified candidates are elected or unjust laws are passed.
1.3.4.1. Con: When citizens are required to vote, they are likely to become [more politically engaged and informed](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/21/enforced-compulsory-voting-results-in-more-evenly-distributed-political-knowledge/)(In conclusion, compulsory voting – particularly where it is enforced with sanctions or fines – does appear to result in more evenly distributed political knowledge than voluntary systems.) and make better decisions.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Even with an incentive to learn more, it may be very difficult for voters to distinguish between good and [reliable sources](https://reboot-foundation.org/fighting-fake-news/)(What makes the calls for media literacy education even more urgent is the lack of time spent on media literacy in the classroom. According to survey data from the 2018 National Assessment of Educational Progress, more than a third of U.S. middle school students report “rarely” or “never” learning how to judge the reliability of sources. While over 40 percent of middle school students report learning this skill “sometimes” in class, just over a fifth of students report learning this skill “often.”).
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: There are many tools and [resources](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/fake_news)(This guide provides information, tools and tips on identifying and avoiding misinformation, disinformation and propaganda.) for identifying reliable news sources.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Pieces of research that [measure the biases](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) of different news sources exist, are easy to find, and are relatively objective.
1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Most news resources are controversial in some ways and thus often face [criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/bbc-impartiality-elite-consensus-crisis-legitimacy)(Meanwhile, the BBC’s political reporting, which lies at the heart of its public service remit, seems ever more entangled in the world of Westminster, managing to appear both frivolous and elitist. Leading figures at the BBC have made much of the rise of “fake news”, yet too often its journalists have failed to challenge disinformation at the heart of our political system.) from both political sides.
1.3.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Partisan misinformation often seeks to masquerade itself as reliable news.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Humans tend to seek and remember information that reinforces their own preexisting beliefs; even voters who research issues deeply often do so to [rationalize](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2017/01/30/book-review-democracy-for-realists-why-elections-do-not-produce-responsive-government-by-christopher-h-achen-and-larry-m-bartels/)(Even the minority of voters that have the time and inclination to inform themselves about politics do not behave as folk theory contends. When faced with choice in a democracy, human judgement is overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and bent by self-interest. Voters use information not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them, which the authors describe as ‘enhanced bias’.) their existing views.
1.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Studies have shown that, while people prefer to find or follow news that are similar to their own beliefs, they do not actively avoid sources that contradict their views. Indeed, many seek out challenging news \([p. 27](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~garrettk/Garrett-ICA-Seeking_Similarity-final.pdf)(The lessons learned here are important despite the questions that remain. A desire for\nexposure to viewpoint-supporting information is not synonymous with an aversion to other\nviewpoints. Though individuals are likely to use the information resources available to them to\nexpand their familiarity with the arguments that support their position, there is no reason to expect\nthat they will systematically screen out exposure to other viewpoints. Though individuals are\nselective about their contact with other viewpoints, they are willing to expend additional effort to\nunderstand them.)\).
1.3.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Social media algorithms, such as the one [Facebook](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-echo-chamber/) uses, create and reinforce echo-chambers of political views.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Mandatory voting may encourage campaigns to target and educate uninformed voters.
1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: It may be more effective and efficient for political campaigns to appeal to the emotions of voters, rather than trying to educate them.
1.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Countries that enforce strong mandatory voting laws tend to have more [politically informed citizens](https://qz.com/746737/there-is-a-way-democracies-can-create-better-informed-voters-but-youre-not-going-to-like-it/)(But compulsory voting has the potential to do more than just increase voter turnout, according to a recent analysis by Jill Sheppard, a political scientist and survey researcher at the Australian National University. Her findings suggests that in nations that enforce mandatory voting, a wider demographic spectrum is politically informed than in other countries.) from all education backgrounds.
1.3.4.1.2.3. Con: Many voters do not seek out political news, as the burden of getting informed outweighs the impact of casting one vote \([p. 27](https://books.google.es/books?hl=es&lr=&id=jOMuqXpMfuEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=democracy+voters+should+make+informed+decision&ots=88_hD22FJ8&sig=ETbbo152_2rN0GsXWmU_5sFV0Wo&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)(\[The citizens vote\] is not decisive: it is lost in a sea of other votes. Hence, whether he himself is well-informed has no perceptible impact on the benefits he gets. If all others express their true views, he gets the benefits of a well-informed electorate no matter how well-informed he is; if they are badly informed, he cannot produce these benefits himself....Since all men do this, the election does not reflect the true consent of the governed. \(Downs 1957: 246\))\).
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Political issues are more likely to be a topic of conversation among one's friends and colleagues when voting is mandatory.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: If people are forced to vote, they may look for guidance on how to vote from their friends and family.
1.3.4.1.3.2. Con: People may still be uncomfortable talking about politics with their friends, who may have different opinions.
1.3.4.1.3.3. Con: If people would otherwise not have voted, they probably have little interest in discussing it anyway.
1.3.4.1.3.4. Pro: Mandatory voting would be a shared social experience for most people, which could make voters feel more responsible for the actions and policies of their chosen political party.
1.3.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: If people worry about the social consequences of being associated with unjust laws or politicians, they may try to become more politically informed.
1.3.4.1.3.4.2. Pro: Voluntary voting systems make it easier for voters to absolve themselves of the actions of their government by refusing to vote. Mandatory voting systems make this more difficult.
1.3.4.1.3.4.3. Con: An individual voting for a politician based on policies they promised to implement is not the same as an individual feeling responsible for policies they end up implementing when in power.
1.3.4.1.4. Con: If individuals are disinterested in learning about or participating in politics, they will likely continue being disinterested once voting is mandatory.
1.3.4.1.5. Con: Even if non-voters could be informed, voters tend to do a [poor job](https://balkin.blogspot.com/2013/10/why-political-ignorance-is-serious.html)(Most of the public knows very little about politics and public policy. They also often do a poor job of evaluating the political information they do know. Such ignorance and irrationality are not the result of "stupidity" or the unavailability of information. They are in fact perfectly rational behavior.) of evaluating the information they do know, leaving open the considerable possibility of manipulation by extremist candidates.
1.3.4.2. Con: Compulsory voting would address the [assurance problem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voting/#JustCompVoti)(Relatedly, one might argue compulsory voting helps citizens overcome an “assurance problem” \(Hill 2006\). The thought here is that an individual voter realizes her individual vote has little significance. What’s important is that enough other voters like her vote. However, she cannot easily coordinate with other voters and ensure they will vote with her. Compulsory voting solves this problem.), which is created when voters believe that their votes do not matter unless they are coordinating their votes with others.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Many voters are motivated to vote for politicians by superficial reasons \([p. 622](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/pa/staff/rosema/publications/rosema-2007-electoral-studies.pdf)(It may well be that some citizens follow politics closely and base their electoral preferences on considerations concerning governments’ past performance and political parties’ future plans, whereas other citizens follow politics less closely and choose on the basis of other considerations - for example, political leaders’ rhetoric skills and physical appearance\n...\nIf voters who base their choice on considerations that are not consistent with the functions of elections are more likely to abstain than other voters, low turnout could in fact be considered a good thing.)\).
1.3.4.4. Con: In a democracy, everyone's vote is equally legitimate, regardless of how they choose the candidates they vote for.
1.3.4.5. Pro: In the [US](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/americas-poverty-education_b_1826000.html), there is a strong link between poverty and a lack of education, which could make it easier to politically manipulate impoverished people.
1.3.4.6. Pro: In recent years, there has been a [rise](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-23/the-rise-of-elected-autocrats-threatens-democracy) in the electoral success of populist [autocratic](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/01/turkey-election-choice-democracy-autocracy-erdogan) and radical politicians. This has been attributed to their appeals to the emotions and fears of voters, rather than to their reason.
1.3.4.6.1. Pro: Several dictators, like [Ferdinand Marcos](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marcos-inaugurated)(After a bitter and decisive campaign, he was elected president. In 1969, he was reelected.\n\nMarcos’ second term was marked by increasing civil strife and violence by leftist insurgents. In 1972, following a series of bombings in Manila, he warned of an imminent communist takeover and declared martial law. In 1973, he assumed dictatorship powers under a new constitution.), were initially elected before seizing control of their governments.
1.3.4.6.2. Con: Many countries go [long periods](https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/growth-rise-populism-political-extremism-groups-experts-historians-comment/)(After decades of relative stability, societies all over the world are now wracked with deep divisions. For young people in China and south-east Asia, opportunities are greater than 50 years ago – but so are the risks. Increased individualisation, loosened social structures and volatile financial markets form the backdrop against which these young people seek to fulfil their dreams of comfort and consumption.) of time without prominent radical or authoritarian candidates, indicating that voters often do not select them when they have other good options.
1.4. Con: It will be very difficult to implement mandatory voting in many places.
1.4.1. Con: [Empirical evidence](https://voxeu.org/article/compulsory-voting-turnout-and-government-spending)(Using disaggregated data on state spending in 1980-2012, we analyse the impact of compulsory voting laws on state-level spending. Interestingly, after controlling for state specific fixed factors, country-wide year specific factors, as well as trends in state-level spending, we show that changes in compulsory voting laws did not lead to significant changes in the level or the composition of spending at the state level. In particular, our empirical results show that neither the amount of state-level spending, nor the share of this budget devoted to administrative, welfare or infrastructure spending, significantly changed with the introduction or removal of compulsory voting.) indicates that compulsory voting laws do not increase the costs of elections, which suggests that they are not more costly to implement than voluntary voting systems.
1.4.1.1. Con: Strict election and campaign laws are a better way to reduce the costs of political campaigns and elections as a whole.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: In [Germany](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why-germany-s-politics-are-much-saner-cheaper-and-nicer-than-ours/280081/), campaigns get government funding, parties are allocated TV advertising time, and micro-targeting voters does not occur. This leads to cheap and short elections.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Such laws are often [overturned](https://www.opensecrets.org/resources/learn/timeline). Compulsory voting is a better long-term way to reduce these costs.
1.4.1.2. Con: The [increasing cost](https://electionwatch.unimelb.edu.au/australia-2016/articles/2016-federal-election-to-cost-$227-million)(Why so much? Well, Australia’s federal elections are the country’s largest logistical event – with over 15 million enrolled voters. Compulsory voting ensures mass participation, with voter turnout in 2013 around 93%. Increasingly, the financial cost of implementing our democratic principles has ballooned.) of elections in Australia can be tied to its implementation of mandatory voting.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The increase in election costs in Australia is due to a trend in elections becoming [more expensive](https://electionwatch.unimelb.edu.au/australia-2016/articles/2016-federal-election-to-cost-$227-million)(Since 1990, the cost per federal election has increased by around 15%. Interestingly, the 2010 election costs $2 million less than the 2007 campaign and is the only modern election to not increase in cost. However, the ‘cost-effective’ 2010 election is more likely to have profited from the bloated 2007 election – which increased by $46 million or 39%.) in general, and not with the implementation of mandatory voting.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: The relatively high cost of elections in Australia is likely due to the fact that Australia holds elections [more frequently](https://electionwatch.unimelb.edu.au/australia-2016/articles/2016-federal-election-to-cost-$227-million)(A final issue is the frequency of Australia’s elections. Statistically speaking, Australia holds elections more often than most other parliamentary democracies. The short three-year parliamentary terms are an anomaly in liberal democracies where 92% of similar democracies have either four or five year terms. For instance, the UK, Canada and France all have five-year terms. In the last 50 years, Australia has held 19 elections, while the UK and Canada have held 12 and 15 respectively. If Australia had five-year fixed-term elections, we would have gone to the polls just 10 times and would have saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nClearly, one way to reduce the cost of elections is to have fewer of them.) than other comparable democracies.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Mandatory voting laws in Australia ensure a high voter turnout of over 90%, or 15 million people, which costs the government around [$15 per voter](https://electionwatch.unimelb.edu.au/australia-2016/articles/2016-federal-election-to-cost-$227-million)(The cost to hold a federal election has risen 15% on average since 1990. This year’s poll is predicated to cost taxpayers at least $227 million, or around $15 per voter.\n\nWhy so much? Well, Australia’s federal elections are the country’s largest logistical event – with over 15 million enrolled voters. Compulsory voting ensures mass participation, with voter turnout in 2013 around 93%. Increasingly, the financial cost of implementing our democratic principles has ballooned.), and $227 million in aggregate.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Parties often use advertising to increase voter turnout. As a consequence, candidates advertise signifcantly more when voting is voluntary compared to when it is compulsory \([p. 1](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.530.6705&rep=rep1&type=pdf)(Finally, we discover that candidates tend to overadvertise, and contrary to theoretical predictions, advertise significantly more when voting is voluntary than when it is compulsory.)\).
1.4.1.4. Con: This effect will only happen in countries where governments provide political parties with election funds.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Politicians would still spend that money to convince citizens to vote for them above other candidates.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: In [Australia](https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/beyond-turnout-consequences-compulsory-voting), the Liberal National Coalition supported compulsory voting in order to redirect their existing funds to other purposes.
1.4.1.4.3. Con: Many countries are beginning to incorporate some form of public funding in their elections.
1.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: Some form of public funding for political parties exists in a large number of [democracies](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/index.html), such as most of the EU, Canada, Brazil, Japan and even the US.
1.4.1.5. Pro: Mandatory voting lowers the cost of generating turnout, thereby [reducing pressure on politicians](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/277462-60-minutes-fundraising-demands-turning-lawmakers-into) to spend potential governing time on raising funds.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Political fundraising in the US is split between election costs and [lobbyists](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/30/5949581/money-in-politics-charts-explain)(Money suffuses our political system. Candidates must spend huge sums to get elected, and once they do, well-funded interests spend huge sums to influence how they vote. Campaign finance laws are being struck down, and money is rushing into outside groups that don’t have to disclose their donors. Some studies have found companies can get as much as a 22,000 percent return on their lobbying dollars, while a recent poll from the Global Strategy Group found that more than 90 percent of Americans wants to reduce the role of money in politics.), suggesting that reducing election costs would only shift more money to lobbying.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: A study conducted in 2009 concluded that the return on investment for political lobbying in the US is [22,000%](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2009/04/09/return-on-lobbying-investment-22000/)(There’s a reason why lobbying has boomed so much over the last decade. The potential return on investment is just too lucrative to pass up. Some things are easy to quantify, a contract, an earmark, or a direct payment for services. But other things, like tax breaks, can take a little bit more time to figure out \(at least for now\). For example, a University of Kansas study, to be released today, will show that firms pushing for a “tax holiday” in 2004 received a 22,000% return on their lobbying investment. I’ll write that number again: 22,000%.), which creates a massive incentive for politicians to continue working with lobbyists.
1.4.1.5.1.2. Con: There are [limitations](https://www.tenenbaumlegal.com/articles/limitations-on-lobbying-activities-the-rules-for-501c3-organizations/)(Under the expenditures test, an organization can quantify exactly how much lobbying it may engage in each year. A sliding scale specifies the amount an organization may expend on all lobbying activities in relation to the amount it spends on most of its other activities \(i.e., expenditures in furtherance of the organization's tax-exempt purposes\). Under Section 4911\(c\)\(2\) of the Code, the maximum allowable annual lobbying is the sum of:\n\ni. 20% of the first $500,000 of an organization's exempt purpose expenditures, plus\nii. 15% of the second $500,000 of such expenditures, plus\niii. 10% of the third $500,000 of such expenditures, plus\niv. 5% of the remainder of such expenditures, with a cap of $1 million in annual lobbying expenses.) on the amount of lobbying that companies can engage in. Politicians are unlikely to spend extra time pursuing lobbying activities if there is no additional financial gain.
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: US Democrats elected to Congress are advised to spend as much as [4 hours a day](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291.html) making fundraising calls, and additional time organizing fundraiser and donor outreach events.
1.4.2. Pro: Mandatory voting would require the implementation of a complex [infrastructure](https://qz.com/1920978/does-compulsory-voting-hurt-or-benefit-democracy/)(The benefits of compulsory voting do come at a cost. One is purely logistical. “When you have compulsory voting, you need a whole infrastructure to enforce it,” says Anthony Fowler, a professor, Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. You need systems for everything from knowing when people don’t show up to vote to sending them a piece of mail if they missed the election.\n\nEven more money is needed to ensure that the experience of voting is relatively painless. “If everyone’s voting, my vote had better be counted. Don’t lose my ballot, don’t send me broken machines—basically, don’t irritate people if you’re going to make them vote,” Hill says. “You need so many things in place to keep that high level of acceptance in the system and to ensure that it’s considered to be a legitimate imposition on your personal freedom.”) to ensure the smooth running of such a system. This is a huge administrative burden.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Post-election identification of homeless voters and migrant labourers who are not on voting lists would be very difficult in especially large democracies.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: This problem could be solved by making the resources and social services available to at-risk populations more comprehensive, which could make it easier for these populations to vote and seek the help they need.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Countries around the world struggle with tracking individuals experiencing [homelessness](https://homelessworldcup.org/homelessness-statistics/)(Getting an accurate picture of global homelessness is extremely challenging. Definitions of homelessness vary from country to country. Census data is typically collected based on household and, while most census data takes into account those living in shelters and receiving government aid, census takers struggle to count the “hidden homeless” – those who may be residing in inadequate settlements such as slums, squatting in structures not intended for housing, couch surfing with friends and family, and those who relocate frequently.) that travel frequently or live in extremely poor conditions.
1.4.2.2. Con: In Ecuador, where voting is mandatory, proof of having voted is issued at the polling station. The cost associated with this is relatively small as it only requires printing slips \([pp. 20-21](http://www.oas.org/sap/publications/1998/moe/ecuador/pbl_17_1998_eng.pdf)(The voting procedure established indicates that voters must wait their turn at the polling station in order to vote by forming two lines: one for men and one for women. If their names are on the electoral list, they cast their vote after showing their identification cards. If a person’s name does not appear on the voter registration list, then that person is not permitted to vote, although he is given a certificate of attendance and polling station officials must record his personal data on the form for persons whose names do not appear on the voter registration list. \n\nIlliterate persons record their vote with their right thumbprint.)\).
1.4.2.3. Con: With modern communication technology and infrastructure, it is not particularly difficult to keep track of voters.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: This may require unjust forms of surveillance or tracking on part of the government.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Fears that equate the governmental use and regulation of technology with unjust surveillance and oversight tend to [miss the fact](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/regulation-and-legislation-lag-behind-technology/)(“The government enforcement process, when it comes to technology, is inherently behind current technology,” said Terrell McSweeny, partner at Covington & Burling LLP and former commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission. “The enforcers are coming along and picking up issues when they arise, but they’re lagging a little bit.”) that regulation tends to lag behind technological innovation.
1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro: Political commentators in the US often interpret new laws that involve technology as signs that the opposition government could find new ways to collect and misuse personal data.
1.4.2.3.1.2.1. Con: In many cases, commentators are reporting rumors or deliberately misrepresenting [facts](https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2021/10/12/will-the-irs-track-every-venmo-transaction-fact-checking-financial-reporting-plans/)(But this isn’t right. First, The American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed by Congress in March, has a provision that will go into effect on Jan. 1 that requires cash apps like Venmo, PayPal and Zelle to send information reports to merchants and the IRS regarding business transactions totaling more than $600. Previously, cash apps were required to report only business transactions over $20,000 from accounts with at least 200 separate payments in a calendar year.), which suggests that many of the fears of governments using or regulating technology are overblown.
1.4.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Conservative commentator Candace Owens misleadingly [claimed on Twitter](https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/2021/10/12/will-the-irs-track-every-venmo-transaction-fact-checking-financial-reporting-plans/)(Conservative commentator Candace Owens repeated this in a tweet, writing that “the Biden administration is attempting to empower the IRS to monitor every single withdrawal, deposit, and transaction you make from your personal banking accounts, PayPal, Venmo, etc..”\n...\nThe Treasury Department clarified further...:\n“The Administration’s bank reporting proposal does not track transactions in your bank account, or payments you make on Venmo, Paypal, or with any other payment service provider. The proposal adds two additional boxes to existing information reports that banks send to the IRS already. Specifically, total deposits and total withdrawals in a year.”) that IRS reporting reforms specifically aimed at banks and [tranfer apps](https://www.investopedia.com/best-money-transfer-apps-5180183) were an attempt by the Democratic administration to capture individuals' spending and financial data.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: The US has already started expanding its rules to include the use of mobile apps like Venmo and CashApp in order to make it easier for the IRS to track and [collect taxes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/cash-apps-to-report-payments-of-600-or-more/)(If you receive $600 or more payments in total for goods and services through a third-party payment network, such as Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle, these payments will now be reported to the IRS.\n\nThe new rule results from the American Rescue Plan signed into law in March 2021 and will mainly impact business owners using third-party payment network providers. The IRS is cracking down on payments received through apps, such as Cash App, Zelle or Paypal to ensure those using the third-party payment networks are paying their fair share of taxes.). Similar techniques can be used for enforcing mandatory voting.
1.4.2.4. Pro: It may become prohibitively expensive to regulate and prevent the production of faked proof of voting.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Many countries have had to use [expensive and novel methods](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/09/07/abc-cops-use-apps-to-spot-fake-ids)(Hanna’s ABC unit is one of nearly two dozen in 10 states that use an app called Age ID, according to the app’s developer, Intellicheck. It scans the barcode on the back of an ID and draws on a database containing information from every state’s motor vehicle department. It can verify the information in seconds and is updated at least monthly.) to prevent the use of fake IDs. Similar costs will likely emerge with proof of voting.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: The [methods used](https://www.michigandaily.com/arts/underground-artistry-fake-ids/)(IDs may have everything from a fun bear outline when a light is shined on it to a fun “tricolor image of a bridge on the front that appears and disappears when viewed from different from different angles.” These characteristics are meant to make an ID harder to copy, and they do, but some see these simply as obstacles to overcome on their way to a night on the town.) to create fake proofs of voting would likely be similar to those used to fake other governmental documents. As a result, the means to address these crimes already exist and would not likely require more resources.
1.4.3. Pro: Past attempts to mandate actions that citizens must take, like imposing health and safety restrictions, have been met with [protest](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59363256)(Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the Belgian capital, Brussels, to protest against anti-Covid measures.) and resistance in many countries, which could make compulsory voting more difficult to enforce.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The US would likely be resistant to a voting mandate, as many US citizens have protested [other mandates](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/17/1046598351/the-political-fight-over-vaccine-mandates-deepens-despite-their-effectiveness)(For some of those who have not been vaccinated, the message from conservative leaders like Abbott and DeSantis about choice and liberty resonates, despite public health guidance on how to prevent serious illness and death from the coronavirus.\n\n"Somehow it has morphed into not getting the vaccine as a way to defend their freedom and resist this 'tyranny,' " said Ken Resnicow, a professor in the school of public health at the University of Michigan. "There's not many countries that have this dynamic.").
1.4.3.2. Con: Compulsory voting has become an [uncontroversial](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/bonotti-strangio-australian-experience-of-compulsory-voting/13531720)(Compulsory voting has a century-long history in this nation. Not only is it a durable feature of Australian democracy, but it is universally applied. Whenever an election is called, whether it be at the national, state or territory level, voters are obliged to turn out at pain of being fined or, in the last resort, being gaoled for failure to comply.) part of political life in many countries.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Compulsory voting would struggle to be approved in countries that have overwhelmingly opposed it historically, like [the US](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=120577&page=1)(The poll found that 72 percent of respondents oppose a law that would require all eligible citizens to vote in national elections and levy a small fine on non-voters who do not have a good excuse for skipping the polls. Just 21 percent said that enacting a law that makes voting compulsory would be a good idea.\n\nThe results are almost identical to those found in Gallup polls in 1965, when 69 percent opposed such a law. Opinions haven't changed, even though voter turnout has slipped from about 63 percent of eligible voters in 1964 to 55 percent in 2000.).
1.4.4. Con: Compulsory voting has been successfully [implemented](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/18/many-western-europeans-think-mandatory-voting-is-important-but-americans-are-split/)(Worldwide, 27 countries have compulsory voting laws, according to the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance \(IDEA\).) in 27 countries, indicating that it is a viable policy.
1.4.4.1. Con: Voter participation in Australia has seen a drop in recent years and is currently at its lowest since the inception of compulsory voting in 1925 \([p. 2](https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/P691-Compulsory-voting-briefing-note-WEB.pdf)(Figure 1 shows that the 91% turnout rate in the 2016 federal election for the House of Representatives was the lowest recorded since compulsory voting in federal elections was introduced.)\).
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: In Australia, the penalty imposed for not voting without an explanation is a [$20 fine](https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote)(Electors who fail to vote at a State election, and do not provide a valid and sufficient reason for such failure, will be fined.\n\nThe penalty for first time offenders is $20,). This is unlikely to be enough to force most people into participating.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: In the 2013 Australian election, [approximately 94%](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23810381) of eligible voters turned out to vote. This suggests that a $20 fine is a sufficient deterrent to not voting.
1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: While the initial fine is $20 for non-compliance with Australian voting laws, repeat offenders or those who do not pay are subject to a [higher penalty](https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote)(,...and this increases to $50 if you have previously paid a penalty or been convicted of this offence. If you do not have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting, you can pay the penalty and that will end the matter.\n\nElectors who do not respond to notices or do not pay the prescribed penalty may have the matter referred to the Fines Enforcement Registry and could have their driver's licence suspended.), which will likely have a more persuasive influence.
1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.4.
1.4.4.3. Pro: The countries successfully using mandatory voting are a diverse set, spread across the world and with different political systems, suggesting that it can work in a variety of cases.
1.5. Con: Compulsory voting may discriminate against disadvantaged and minority communities.
1.5.1. Pro: Punishing non-voters will disproportionately harm poorer individuals who are less able to afford the [prohibitive costs](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305176)(The costs of voting include the use of time and direct travel costs.) associated with voting or may may struggle to pay fines.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Fining those who are most disillusioned with the political system perpetuates cycles of discrimination directed toward them by outlawing forms of political protest.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: People are already fined for engaging in [protest](https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/rights-protesters/anti-protest-bills-around-country)(In response to epic protests around the country, state legislators in nearly 20 states proposed bills in 2017 that would restrict people’s right to protest. The ACLU fought back and many of the bills died or were amended to remove unconstitutional language. For those that passed, we’re hopeful that protestors will exercise their right to dissent and courts will prevent the use of these laws to unconstitutionally burden protest activity. This map is current as of June 23, 2017.), especially when accused of damaging property, yet it still occurs \([p. 1](http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2017-18%20ENR/hB/HB2128%20ENR.PDF)(A person who is arrested for or convicted of trespass may be held liable for any damages to personal or real property while trespassing.)\).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Mandatory voting systems might limit the ways individuals could protest their governments by forcing them to go through the voting process to cast voided ballots instead of abstaining from voting.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.1.
1.5.1.2. Pro: The cost of voting is [generally greater for those who are poorer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/business/for-racial-justice-employees-need-paid-hours-off-for-voting.html)(For most low-income people — a category that tragically overrepresents black Americans — it is a reality. Voting means lost time, and for a worker paid by the hour, or a gig worker paid by the task or ride, that means lost earnings.) as they often cannot afford to miss work or travel to polling stations.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: It is possible to have forms of early voting and postal voting, which allow citizens to vote without physically attending a polling booth.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the 2013 election in Australia, [27% of votes](http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/2016/key-facts.htm) were received prior to election day \(including pre-poll, postal, and mobile voting\).
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: It may be difficult to pass universal absentee or vote by mail laws because they currently face [political](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/864899178/why-is-voting-by-mail-suddenly-controversial-heres-what-you-need-to-know)(The president has made it clear that despite voting by mail himself multiple times, he does not support wide expansion of the practice.\n\nHe has tweeted a number of false claims about what states are doing, including saying it was illegal for the secretary of state of Michigan to mail all registered voters in that state ballot request forms, and misrepresenting California's decision to mail all registered voters ballots.)

But even among President Emmanuel Macron’s own party, there are different views on whether expanding electoral participation via postal ballots is a good idea.) in some countries.
1.5.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Opposition to voting by mail is often based on misleading claims about voter fraud that have been [refuted](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53353404)(Numerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare.\n\nBut the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nAnd Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: "There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud.").
1.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: The ongoing global Covid-19 pandemic has created a [demand](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/13/mail-in-voting-became-much-more-common-in-2020-primaries-as-covid-19-spread/)(State officials say they’re trying to guarantee all eligible voters’ constitutional rights in the middle of an unprecedented public health crisis, especially as the pandemic has forced more than a dozen states to postpone their primaries and created uncertainty about how to conduct the November election safely if the outbreak is still raging then.) for accessible and safe alternatives to voting in person.
1.5.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Voting by mail](https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voting-mail-and-absentee-voting)(Americans have traditionally voted in neighborhood polling places, but since the 1980s, many states have eased rules on issuing absentee ballots, allowed voters to cast ballots in person before Election Day, or even begun mailing ballots to all voters. The movement to vote-by-mail reached new levels with the 2020 elections and COVID-19 pandemic.) has become more common in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Travelling to polling stations can have [financial implications](https://money.cnn.com/2015/08/05/news/economy/poor-people-voting-rights/index.html)(Elections are held on a work day, when time often equals money -- especially if you get paid by the hour. And having a car or paying extra for public transportation to get to the polls can just add to that expense.\n\nBeing 'too busy' or encountering 'transportation problems' were the reasons why 28% of people making less than $20,000 did not vote in 2012.); either in the form of transport costs or in work time lost due to the length of the journey.
1.5.1.2.2.1. Con: Local governments could arrange mass transportation to take people to voting locations.
1.5.1.2.2.2. Pro: The rise in closures of rural and lesser-used polling stations can mean increased [travel distances](https://www.northnorfolknews.co.uk/news/north-norfolk-district-council-small-polling-station-review-6405110)(North Norfolk District Council papers suggest the school room at Horsey Methodist Church may no longer be used at election time, leaving the 49 voters in the community the option of either travelling to the next nearest polling place at Sea Palling 3.8 miles away or voting by post.) for voters. This disadvantages those on more restrictive time and financial budgets.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: Many countries declare election day to be a [holiday](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/06/weekday-elections-set-the-u-s-apart-from-many-other-advanced-democracies/)(A Pew Research Center analysis finds that 27 of the 36 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development hold their national elections on the weekend, while two others \(Israel and South Korea\) hold elections on weekdays but make those days national holidays so economic hardship won’t be a barrier to electoral participation.) or hold elections on [Sunday](https://brilliantmaps.com/election-days/)(Sunday is far and away the most common election day around the world.), which are traditionally non-working days for many people.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: Given the number of shops and services that still function on the weekend and on holidays, compulsory voting would still be a hardship for people who work these jobs.
1.5.1.2.3.2. Pro: Several [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_shopping), especially those with Catholic traditions, regulate opening hours of businesses on Sundays.
1.5.1.2.4. Con: If a country's situation is dire enough that its citizens cannot afford to vote, then it could use its mandatory voting laws to improve voting accessibility and address financial inequality.
1.5.1.3. Pro: People experiencing homelessness usually have a [lower turn-out](http://www.may2015.com/ideas/why-homeless-people-dont-vote/) rate in elections, as they face structural difficulties when trying to vote.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: People living without homes are less likely to have the [necessary identifying documents](https://nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/legalissues.html)(Pursuant to federal law, namely the Help America Vote Act \(HAVA\), first-time registrants in all states who register by mail must provide a driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number on their voter registration form) often required to vote.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: In countries with restrictive voter ID laws, mandatory voting legislation could be used to reform ID requirements or make identifying documents more accessible.
1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: It is difficult to register to vote or obtain an official form of identification without a [permanent address](https://invisiblepeople.tv/how-do-people-who-are-homeless-get-their-mail/amp/)(Applying for benefits or housing, receiving official communications, opening a bank account, replacing identification, registering the vehicle you live in, and 100 other different tasks that fall under the heading of “daily minutiae” for housed people can easily spiral out of control for homeless people if they don’t have a reliable place to receive their mail.).
1.5.1.3.2. Pro: Many who are homeless often have [criminal records](https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/homeless-vote-rights-study-united-states/)(In many states, people with felony convictions are barred from voting. In addition to confusion caused by the inconsistency of this ban from state-to-state, such laws can easily be falsely assumed to apply more broadly to those who have been incarcerated. People experiencing homelessness in the U.S. have high incarceration rates.) that bar them from voting.
1.5.1.3.2.1. Con: If laws are in place that prevent individuals from voting, it would not make sense to enact or uphold laws that would punish them for not voting.
1.5.1.3.3. Con: Low voter turnout is a key problem that mandatory voting laws are designed to address, which suggests that these laws could be written to address the structural obstacles to voting.
1.5.1.4. Con: In mandatory voting systems, non-voters are often given time to offer a justification before being punished \([p. 7](https://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf)(In practice, the demand for an explanation forms part of contemporary enforcement procedures in virtually all systems, in as much as this is a necessary adjunct to the imposition of a penalty. How this is handled varies from state to state; in Australia, non-voters are first asked to justify their non-participation before a decision is made whether or not to impose fine, whereas in other cases \(Belgium, Luxembourg, and most Latin American states\), it is up to electors to take the initiative to explain their absence from the polls to the relevant authorities in order to avoid measures being taken to penalise them.)\).
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Those who have legitimate reasons for not voting, such as sickness or mobility difficulties, could be exempt from punishment.
1.5.1.4.2. Con: Providing these justifications may be a bureaucratic and time-wasting effort, making it hard for poorer people to submit them. Similar problems plague the provision of [other antipoverty programs](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/many-eligible-snap-beneficiaries-are-tripped-bureaucratic-hurdles)(“Agencies incur additional administrative costs to the extent the case requires a new application, involving two to three times as much caseworker effort as a recertification,” Mills said. “Households lose benefits to the extent that they remained eligible during their churn spell. The forgone benefits, although a small percentage of a state’s annual benefit payments, can cause significant hardship for the affected clients.”).
1.5.1.5. Con: While fines could be used to enforce voter participation, they can easily be replaced by non-pecuniary methods, such as formal reprimands, name-and-shame systems, or loss of access to public services \([p. 8-9](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf)\).
1.5.1.5.1. Con: While these could make punishments less severe, they do not address the underlying injustice of punishing individuals for failing to comply with a mandate rather than providing them with the support that they need.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Con: Mandatory voting laws could be crafted to ensure that individuals struggling to comply with the mandate receive support and resources rather than punishments.
1.5.1.5.2. Con: Removing access to public services would drastically harm poorer individuals. For example, in [Bolivia](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk)(In 1952, Bolivia began to give voters a card to prove their participation at an election. If voters cannot show this proof-of-voting card during the three months after the election, they can be prevented from drawing their salary from the bank.), those found to not have voted can lose access to their bank accounts.
1.5.1.5.3. Pro: Brazil, the largest country with compulsory voting, uses non-monetary sanctions \([p. 103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1866802X0900100105)(Evasion is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a \n250,000 USD fine, but prosecutions are rare. On the other hand, no adult male can obtain federal student loans, job training, or government jobs with-out proof of registration, so it behooves most young men to comply.)\).
1.5.1.5.4. Pro: In “use-it-or-lose it systems”, like the one in Belgium, when voters do not vote for a long period of time they are removed from the electoral roll \([p. 8](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_2S5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT22&lpg=PT22&dq=If+voting+is+considered+to+be+a+civic+duty,+it+would+seem+logical+that+non-voters+should+have+their+civic+rights+restricted.+The+most+obvious+right+to+restrict+is+the+right+to+vote+itself.+In+Belgium,+if+a+voter+has+not+voted+in+four+elections+over+the+course+of+15+years,+he+or+she+is+removed+from+the+electoral+rolls+for+ten+years.&source=bl&ots=NZQI6GeoJc&sig=ACfU3U3pQzVLX5lDyJCiejWMtt2OVuXFvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwja37Xc7OH0AhVYPcAKHXZGAbAQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q&f=false)(If voting is considered to be a civic duty, it would seem logical that non-voters should have their civic rights restricted. The most obvious right to restrict is the right to vote itself. In Belgium, if a voter has not voted in four elections over the course of 15 years, he or she is removed from the electoral rolls for ten years.)\).
1.5.1.5.4.1. Con: Removing non-voters from the electoral roll functions like problematic forms of voter registration [purges](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/voter-purges)(Voter purges are an often-flawed process of cleaning up voter rolls by deleting names from registration lists. While updating registration lists as voters die, move, or otherwise become ineligible is necessary and important, when done irresponsibly — with bad data or when two voters are confused for the same person — the process can knock eligible voters off the roll en masse, often with little notice. Many voters discover they’re no longer listed only when they arrive at the polling place. As a result, many eligible Americans either don’t vote or are forced to cast provisional ballots.) in the US, which make voting more difficult.
1.5.1.5.4.2. Pro: After not voting in at least four elections within 15 years, voters in Belgium get excluded from the voting rolls for 10 years \([p. 8](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf)(The most obvious right to restrict is the right to vote itself. In Belgium, if a voter has not voted in four elections over the course of 15 years, he or she is removed from the electoral rolls for ten years.)\). If that happens, it might be difficult for them to get a [job](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk) in the public sector.
1.5.1.5.4.3. Pro: In Singapore, non-voters are removed from the electoral register and have to pay a fee or give a "valid and sufficient" reason to be reinstated \([p. 8](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/full_participation_web.pdf)(Singapore operates an unusual system that combines the removal of voting rights with a fine. Non-voters have their names automatically removed from the electoral register and must pay a fee to have them reinstated unless they can produce a ‘valid and sufficient’ reason for not having participated.)\).
1.5.2. Pro: Those with disabilities already face a number of [obstacles](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/blocked-from-the-ballot-box/)(Imagine using a wheelchair or walker and not being able to enter your polling place because there was no ramp, the doors were too narrow, hard to open, and lacked automatic openers, or the pathway to the voting area was obstructed and lacked proper signage; having a vision impairment and encountering a voting machine that did not offer audio or large print ballots, or poll workers who were not trained to set up these features or troubleshoot malfunctions and failed to provide instructions on how to use the machine; or having an intellectual or cognitive disability and being denied the right to vote by state law that reflects incorrect assumptions about your capabilities.) limiting their access to voting. Mandating voting increases the chance of unjust punishments and further disenfranchisement for these individuals.
1.5.2.1. Con: Countries frequently take extraordinary measures to preserve voting access. Therefore, such reforms will not be prohibitively difficult.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: There may not exist political pressure to enfranchise great numbers of people, leading many governments to not invest in such extraordinary measures.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: Some places have enacted online voting systems to preserve voter access.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: India’s Supreme Court has recently pushed the government to change the system to allow non-resident citizens to vote, thanks to [online](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/NRIs-can-now-vote-in-Indian-elections-without-coming-here/articleshow/45862058.cms)(Non-resident Indians \(NRIs\) will soon be able to cast their vote through electronic-ballots or through their nominees residing in India but will never be able to exercise their franchise through the novel method during the coming Delhi assembly polls.) voting.
1.5.2.1.3.2. Pro: Estonia has a sophisticated [internet voting system](https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/e-democracy/)(Internet voting \(i-voting\) is a unique solution that conveniently engages citizens in the governance process. This system allows voters to cast their ballots from any internet-connected computer anywhere in the world.

The voter’s identity is removed from the ballot before it reaches the National Electoral Commission for counting, thereby ensuring anonymity.), allowing people to vote without even having to go to the polls.
1.5.2.1.3.3.

1.5.2.1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.3.
1.5.2.1.3.5.

1.5.2.2. Con: In many places, individuals living with a disability can ask friends, family, or poll workers to act as [voting assistants](https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/publications/assisting-voters-disabilities/)(Almost anyone, including a friend, family member, care provider, or poll worker, can provide assistance to an individual with a disability.), which can make it easier for them to vote.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Even if polling places offer voting assistants, many do not provide [sufficient provision](https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2019/05/12/sight-impaired-voters-and-the-secret-of-the-ballot-box/)(Without the assistance of the poll officer or a companion there was no way that she could mark her ballot paper against the name of the candidate she wished to vote for. It was not realistic, she contended, to expect her to memorise not only all the names of the candidates but the order in which they appeared on the ballot paper. In the 2009 by-election in her constituency for example there were twelve candidates. The position becomes even more complicated if more than one election takes place on the same day.\>\nThis effectively denied her the opportunity to cast her ballot in secret.) for those with visual impairments to cast their vote anonymously.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: The [Voting Rights Act](https://www.justice.gov/crt/statutes-enforced-voting-section)(The Voting Rights Act, also known as the VRA, was enacted by Congress in 1965.\n\nSection 208 of the VRA provides for voters who need assistance to vote by reason of blindness, disability, or inability to read or write.

1.5.2.3. Pro: It may be difficult for those with mobility disabilities to [access](https://www.independentliving.co.uk/voting-still-not-accessible/)(Some issues that have been reported by voters with mobility impairments in previous elections include:\n\n• lack of disabled parking spaces\n• steps into the polling station which they couldn’t negotiate in a wheelchair\n• a doorway too narrow to accommodate the chair\n• polling booths at such a height that a wheelchair user couldn’t reach, so had to complete the ballot paper on their lap, with no privacy.) voting stations and booths.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Many European citizens living with disabilities struggle to vote due to a [lack of accommodations](https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/news/article/a-fundamental-right-to-vote-removing-barriers-for-people-with-disabilities)(The barriers faced by people with disabilities - be they legal or technical - when they want to exercise this right that we nowadays take for granted are still far too high.\n\nNational rules in 16 Member States mean that about 800,000 citizens will be deprived of their right to participate in the European Parliament elections as a result of their disability or mental health problems.\n\nMillions of others will have no practical opportunity to vote due to organisational arrangements or technical barriers that do not take into account the needs resulting from their disability.) and support.
1.5.2.4.1.

1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: Germany lifted a ban that [prevented](https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-85000-adults-with-disabilities-can-vote-for-the-first-time/a-59216367)(Germany’s top court decided in 2019 that adults who have legal guardians should no longer be barred from taking part in elections. Now many of them will do so for the first time.) 85,000 citizens living with disabilities from voting in 2019, which suggests that ableist voting restrictions can be overturned.
1.5.2.4.1.2. Pro: Ableist voter suppression in the EU may be difficult to address because it is part of a larger trend of voter suppression that is on the rise in the [UK](https://us.boell.org/en/2017/11/01/achtung-voter-suppression-coming-europe)(In the United Kingdom, the Conservatives have been pushing for similar voter ID laws, even though only 0.00025 percent of votes cast in 2015 are alleged voter fraud cases Northern Ireland is currently the only province in the UK in which voters have to show photo IDs. But in the 2018 elections, the Conservative Constitution Minister Chris Skidmore is implementing a pilot scheme in which five areas in England will serve as a trial for the rest of the country by requiring some form of identification to vote. Unlike in Northern Ireland, where the government provided free photo IDs when the new rules took effect, there are no plans to introduce a free card in the rest of the UK. According to the Electoral Commission, an estimated 3.5 million people do not have a photo ID and could lose their access to the voting process.), [Germany](https://us.boell.org/en/2017/11/01/achtung-voter-suppression-coming-europe)(In Germany, where national elections were held on September 24, voter suppression tactics are not yet widespread. However, for the first time in Germany’s history, the election saw heated rhetoric around voter fraud that resembled the US debate: The hashtag #Wahlbetrug \(#voterfraud\) trended on Twitter the day before the general elections, thanks to supporters of the right-wing party Alternative for Germany \(AfD\)and Russian Twitter bots. The AfD also called on its supporters to watch the vote count, suggesting that election workers might discount or invalidate some of their votes. The claim led the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \(OSCE\) to send election observers to watch the vote count, a huge win for the AfD.), and [France](https://us.boell.org/en/2017/11/01/achtung-voter-suppression-coming-europe)(In France, supporters of right-wing populist presidential candidate Marine Le Pen also made claims of voter fraud.

1.5.2.4.2. Con: The European Commission released an [ambitious plan](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_810)(Today, the European Commission presents an ambitious Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030 to ensure their full participation in society, on an equal basis with others in the EU and beyond, in line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which establish equality and non-discrimination as cornerstones of EU policies.

It is time to scale up European action.) in 2021 to ensure that individuals living with disabilities are able to fully participate in society by 2030, which suggests that conditions in Europe are improving.
1.5.2.4.2.1.

I think you should lose your rights and voting is one of your rights,” Marc Fucarile told WBZ-TV.) in the US, which could result in political parties refusing to restore their rights.
1.5.3.2. Con: Without comprehensive voter access and law enforcement reforms, compulsory voting may enable a variety of worse forms of discrimination.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Scholars argue that discriminatory policing and voter suppression are linked, meaning that a legal voting mandate could make police discrimination worse \([pp. 263-265](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1606&context=facpubs)(As with voter suppression in the mid-twentieth century, abusive police conduct against minority citizens is a national problem perpetrated by thousands of localities.

Both incidents generated national attention because they reflected ingrained national problems. In the 1960s, countless localities across the South replicated the voting discrimination in Selma, persisting despite decades of federal remedial efforts.)\).
1.5.3.2.2. Con: Comprehensive voter access reform, police reform, and compulsory voting laws are compatible and thus could be enacted together.
1.5.3.3. Con: Compulsory voting may infringe on the religious freedoms of minority faith groups, thus creating new kinds of discrimination.

1.5.3.4.1. Pro: [Only 4%](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/02/05/a-majority-of-the-transgender-community-in-india-are-not-voting-in-elections/) of the transgender population in India are registered as voters.
1.5.3.4.2. Con: While it may be difficult to legally change one's ID, this bureaucratic process should not stop the person from voting using the ID stating their assigned sex at birth in the meantime.
1.5.3.4.2.1. Con: Even when voting in this way is protected by law, transgender individuals often face [discrimination](https://www.them.us/story/how-to-vote-while-transgender-disenfranchisement-voter-id-name-change-laws)(Unfortunately, trans voters can face scrutiny from and rejection by poll workers even when their documents are in alignment with their identity. In 2018, Sade Viscaria, a trans woman in Vermont, was denied the right to vote in a gubernatorial race after a poll worker refused to believe the female gender marker on her ID and accused her of having a fake ID.) from poll workers and can be put in [danger](https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2021)(Sadly, 2021 has already seen at least 50 transgender or gender non-conforming people fatally shot or killed by other violent means. We say at least because too often these stories go unreported — or misreported. In previous years, the majority of these people were Black and Latinx transgender women.) when their gender is publicly scrutinized.
1.5.3.4.2.2. Pro: Transgender voting rights advocates have [confirmed](https://transformthevote.org/voting)(If you decide to go in person to your polling place this year, having ID that doesn’t match your gender identity or presentation should not affect your right to cast a ballot, in any state.) that IDs that do not match a voter's gender identity or presentation should not impact voting access.
1.5.3.4.2.3. Con: For a large number of transgender people, being forced to use an ID with their assigned sex at birth is [unjust](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/voter-id-laws-may-prevent-34000-trans-people-from-voting-on-tuesday) and [painful](http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/04/how-id-laws-disenfranchise-transgender-voters/476511/).
1.5.3.5. Pro: Voting is often more logistically difficult in disenfranchised areas. The institution of mandatory voting would require governments to address this issue.
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: There are often [fewer voting booths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-locations-idUSKCN1VV09J)(States across the American South have closed nearly 1,200 polling places since the Supreme Court weakened a landmark voting-discrimination law in 2013, according to a report released by a civil-rights group on Tuesday.) in marginalized areas. Governments would have to create more to ensure that all people are able to vote.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: Governments could still choose to neglect these structural difficulties, which would make it especially difficult for these voters to vote and avoid punishment.
1.5.3.5.3. Pro: Minority populations often work essential jobs, making it [hard for them to get time off](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/11/12/a-ton-of-people-didnt-vote-because-they-couldnt-get-time-off-from-work/)(A full two-thirds said they simply didn't have enough time to vote. More than half of this group - 35 percent of the total - said that scheduling conflicts with work or school kept them from getting to the polls last Tuesday.) to vote. Under mandatory voting, governments would have to expand services like mail-in voting to compensate.
1.5.4. Con: [Voter ID laws](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/jim-demint-voter-id-laws/480876/)(Conservatives who back the laws say that there’s a danger of fraudulent votes, which pollute the democratic process at best and swing elections at worst. Liberals who oppose them counter that there’s next to no evidence of actual voting fraud; that voter-ID laws wouldn’t stop that fraud anyway; and that the laws are actually intended to depress voter-turnout among the populations that are least likely to hold state-issued photo ID—students, the poor, minorities, and the elderly who are most likely to vote Democratic—and improve conservative prospects in elections, despite demographic changes that favor liberal candidates.) have been passed in the US with the intention of reducing the turnout of low-income and minority voters, many of whom tend to vote for Democratic candidates. Such laws would be less effective if voting were mandatory.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The UK is also proposing voter ID laws that are likely to discourage those who [do not already have](https://www.bigissue.com/latest/voter-id-what-does-the-new-plan-mean-for-voters/)(But around 42 per cent of people who don’t already have ID would be reluctant to sign up for a voter card, according to Cabinet Office research.) valid forms of identification.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: It can be particularly hard for homeless people to procure [forms of ID](https://news.trust.org/item/20210511122902-aevr7)(Housing charities say the ID requirement could make it even harder for homeless people to vote.\n\n"When you're living out of a rucksack, whether on the streets, in hostels or shifting between friends' sofas, important documents like ID can frequently get lost or stolen," said Jon Sparkes, who heads the homeless charity Crisis.\n\n"With replacement costly, it can cause people a lot of difficulty claiming benefits, accessing healthcare and opening bank accounts.") since they can be lost, stolen, or damaged when there is no safe place to keep them.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Voter ID requirements in the UK would [disproportionately disadvantage](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/voter-id-boris-johnson-elections-photo-b1814531.html)(“People from black and minority ethnic groups are less likely to be registered to vote, vote and be elected.”\n\nShe added: “Many voters do not have photo ID, and that ownership of ID can differ by socioeconomic groups, with citizens from Bame communities at a particular potential disadvantage.) black voters and those from other ethnic minority groups.
1.5.4.1.3. Con: These proposals have not yet have been passed and have faced heavy opposition and [procedural hurdles](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/93/human-rights-joint-committee/news/157247/voter-id-law-must-be-shown-to-be-necessary-and-proportionate/)(More detail is needed on how the proposed Voter Card will operate in practice. The Committee calls on the Government to ensure that the document is easily obtainable by anyone who wants one. It must avoid any incidental costs or other barriers, such as a requirement to attend issuing offices in person. The Government must also work with the Electoral Commission to produce detailed plans for how they will promote the Voter Card scheme and encourage individuals to take part, including specific focus on marginalised groups.).
1.5.4.2. Con: Voter ID laws in the US have been passed with bipartisan [support](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_062121/)(4 in 5 Americans \(80%\) support requiring voters to show photo identification in order to cast a ballot. Just 18% oppose this.) to prevent voter fraud.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Investigations of alleged cases of voter fraud are often determined to be [honest mistakes](https://www.aclu.org/other/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet)(Identified instances of “fraud” are honest mistakes. So-called cases of in-person impersonation voter “fraud” are almost always the product of an elections worker or a voter making an honest mistake, and that even these mistakes are extremely infrequent.) rather than fraud.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: There is a [partisan divide](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_062121/)(Approval of making early voting easier stands at 89% among Democrats, 68% among independents, and 56% among Republicans. Support for requiring a photo ID to vote stands at 62% among Democrats, 87% among independents, and 91% among Republicans. Only Democrats back making voting by mail easier to do, with 84% supporting this idea compared to just 40% of independents and 26% of Republicans.) between Democrats who want to make voting easier and Republicans and independents who support strict photo ID requirements, which restrict voting access and rarely address cases of voter fraud.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: Instances of voter fraud in the US that ID laws could prevent are [extremely rare](https://www.aclu.org/other/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet)(In-person fraud is vanishingly rare. A recent study found that, since 2000, there were only 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation – the only type of fraud that photo IDs could prevent – during a period of time in which over 1 billion ballots were cast.).
1.5.4.2.3. Pro: The [Real ID Act of 2005](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/about-real-id)(Secure driver's licenses and identification documents are a vital component of our national security framework. The REAL ID Act, passed by Congress in 2005, enacted the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation that the Federal Government “set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses.” The Act established minimum security standards for license issuance and production and prohibits certain federal agencies from accepting for certain purposes driver’s licenses and identification cards from states not meeting the Act’s minimum standards.) established the minimum requirements for a federal ID in the US with bipartisan support. These could be used to create a national ID in the US.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Strict voter ID laws in the US have a [negative impact](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/elections/voter-id-laws-empirical-evidence-government-accountability-office) on voter turnout in Hispanic, Black, Asian, and multi-racial populations \([pp. 29-30](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/page5/documents/VoterIDLawsSuppressionofMinorityVoters.pdf)(The findings presented here strongly suggest that these laws do, in fact,\nhave real consequences for the makeup of the voting population. Where they are enacted, racial and\nethnic minorities are less apt to vote. The voices of Latinos and to a slightly lesser extent those of Blacks, Asian Americans, and multi-racial Americans all become more muted and the relatively \[sic\] influence of white America grows. An already significant racial skew in American democracy becomes all the more pronounced.)\).
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: The laws that require ID to vote [vary](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx) vastly from state to state, thus making the process confusing and complicated.
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: Voter ID laws in many states are very [strict](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx)(Strict: Voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after Election Day for it to be counted. For instance, the voter may be required to return to an election office within a few days after the election and present an acceptable ID to have the provisional ballot counted. If the voter does not come back to show ID, the provisional ballot is not counted.) and do not accept alternative forms of identification.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: One way to address the discriminatory effects of voter ID laws would be to require the government to take an active role in registering citizens to vote and providing citizens with IDs, which has been shown to increase voter turnout \([p. 3](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/Expanding.Democracy.pdf)(All of the countries in which the government takes an active role in registering voters have much higher voter registration rates than the United States.)\).
1.5.5. Con: [Optional voting](http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/24/news/economy/rich-vote-more/)(One reason for the voting disparity is that lower-income people tend to be less educated and not as politically active in general. In contrast, wealthier people are often better connected to donors, community leaders and politicians who encourage them to vote.) is more discriminatory as it gives greater influence to those who have greater social and financial power: a group already more [likely to vote](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-are-the-poor-and-minorities-less-likely-to-vote/282896/)(According to the U.S. Census, 47 percent of eligible adults with family incomes of less than $20,000 a year voted in 2012 and just one in four voted in the midterm election of 2010. By contrast, those with annual earnings of $100,000 or more turned out at rates of around 80 percent and 60 percent, respectively.) than traditionally marginalized groups.
1.5.5.1. Con: Those with less wealth tend to be less politically engaged and more likely to spoil their ballots. As such, mandatory voting does not meaningfully increase the representation of such groups \([p. 8-9](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244018817141)(However, a countervailing tendency of compulsory voting is to generate large proportions of invalid ballots. As invalid voting is strongly related to income inequality and low education, we conclude that whatever benefits in terms of equal voice are associated with higher turnout under compulsory voting, these are effectively erased by the high share of socioeconomically biased invalid votes that do not count for determining political representation.)\).
1.5.5.1.1. Con: In the US, marginal voters \(those who vote depending on circumstances\) general favour the Democratic party \([p. iii](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11156810/Fowler_gsas.harvard_0084L_10773.pdf?sequence=3)(Across three independent tests and settings, marginal voters are significantly more supportive of the Democratic Party compared to regular voters.)\). As such, turnout of these voters can drastically impact an election's result.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The difference in voter participation between British bottom earners and top earners has increased from 7% in 1960 to 13% in 2005 \([p. 5](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/23098/1/Compulsory_voting\(LSERO\).pdf)(Likewise, between the 1960s and 2005 the difference in turnout between the top and bottom quartile of earners grew from 7% to around 13%. These results are not dissimilar in other countries.)\).
1.5.5.3. Pro: In the US, voter turnout [differs](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/income-gap-at-the-polls-113997)(This class bias is a persistent feature of American voting: A study of 40 years of state-level data finds no instance in which there was not a class bias in the electorate favoring the rich—in other words, no instance in which poorer people in general turned out in higher rates than the rich.) hugely between socioeconomic groups; those with lower levels of income and education, young adults, and recent immigrants are all less likely to vote \([p. 2](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/universal_voting.pdf)(In practice, this might not matter much if non-voters were evenly distributed through the population, so that voters were a microcosm of the people. But that is not the case: in the United States, citizens with lower levels of income and education are less likely to vote, as are young adults and recent immigrants.)\).
