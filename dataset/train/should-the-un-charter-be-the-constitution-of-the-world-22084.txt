Discussion Name: Should the UN Charter be the constitution of the world?

1. The UN Charter should be the constitution of the world.
1.1. Con: Sovereign states are ultimately not answerable to an international body.
1.1.1. Con: If the UN Charter is adopted as the constitution of the world, states would have to agree to give up some sovereignty to the UN.
1.1.2. Pro: Making the UN Charter the world's constitution would create a global government, which would be bad for the world.
1.1.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #16070: Humanity would be better off under a global government.
1.1.2.2. Pro: There would be no organization or country powerful enough to overthrow a global government if it becomes corrupt.
1.1.2.3. Pro: There are only a few moral values that are objectively correct. Imposing them on people of different cultural backgrounds will be detrimental.
1.1.3. Pro: Nation states are answerable to their own citizens and a constitution should represent the will of the people.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The primary responsibility of states is towards their own people.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Citizens in the state vote for the government to represent their wishes and aspirations in legislative bodies. Therefore, their will should be prioritized.

1.1.4. Pro: There is no world leader or world head of state ahead of the Security Council \(the executive branch\).
1.2. Pro: The coalition of nations making up the UN is powerful enough to assert authority or pressure on dissenting members. Going against the will of most other states in the world will be met with pushback.
1.2.1. Con: The UN does not have an army that can credibly enforce rules with the threat of force.
1.2.2. Pro: Economic sanctions imposed by the UN can cripple a country's economy.
1.2.2.1. Con: As seen with [North Korea](https://undocs.org/S/2019/691), there are many ways to circumvent UN sanctions.
1.3. Pro: The UN Charter is the closest we've come to creating a viable blueprint for universal rule of law.
1.3.1. Pro: It is based on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), which is the most important document for humanity.
1.4. Pro: Its rhetoric is constitution-like.
1.4.1. Con: The type of rhetoric used in any document does not determine its legality or legitimacy.
1.4.1.1. Con: Legal documents must have a certain degree of [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_writing#Distinguishing_features) in order to be valid.
1.4.2. Con: Many constitutions of countries are deliberately vague and contain rhetoric.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The US constitution contains flowery language and is [vague](https://benjamindavidsteele.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/the-vague-and-ambiguous-us-constitution/) in order to be open for interpretation.
1.5. Pro: A worldwide constitution would bring greater stability and order to the world.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.6. Con: The UN Charter is outdated and outmoded.
1.6.1. Pro: The UN is essentially a Western-centric organsation that does not reflect the political or economic powers of the world fairly.
1.6.1.1. Con: [Ideas](https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/) like striving for more peaceful and diplomatic relations, higher degree of international cooperation, and standing up for fundamental human rights are global, not Western-centric.
1.6.1.2. Pro: The Security Council's permanent members do not reflect the world's current balance of power.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: As the world's second most populous country, [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_the_United_Nations#Seeking_of_Permanent_Seat_in_UNSC) should have a permanent seat on the Security Council.
1.6.2. Pro: The Charter reflects a Pax-Americano which no longer completely exists.
1.6.2.1. Con: The Charter does not mention America in any special context, other than in [Chapter XIX](https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-xix/index.html), which presents the US government in an administrative role.
1.6.3. Con: The Charter can be amended and updated to reflect changing norms, like any constitution.
1.7. Con: It has not been approved or voted by the world population.
1.7.1. Con: It has been approved and voted on by leaders of countries around the world. These leaders represent their population's will and interests.
1.7.1.1. Con: This is only true for democracies, and then only partially true, as a significant portion of the population would have voted for the losing candidate\(s\).
1.7.2. Pro: This would lead many people to consider the charter as having a [democratic deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_deficit).
1.8. Pro: It, like other constitutions, was written in a special moment of the world's history.
1.8.1. Con: The Communist Manifesto was also written at an important point in history, but is not recognized as a constitution. Being written during an important time in history has nothing to do with a written document being a constitution.
1.8.1.1. Con: The Communist Manifesto would have been akin to a constitution if communism had taken over the world.
1.8.2. Pro: The Charter reflects the values of the world at the end of the most destructive event in our history, World War II. It is important to preserve those values, lest we forget their importance.

1.10. Pro: It is recognised as valid and has been ratified by most of the world's states.
1.10.1. Con: Most states only adhere to the clauses they want to or opt out of others.
1.10.2. Pro: It contains a supremacy clause in [Article 103](http://legal.un.org/repertory/art103.shtml): "In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail."
1.11. Con: The Charter is too remote to world citizens; it does not have the same binding effect as their Constitution.
1.11.1. Pro: Most people have never read and do not know the contents of the UN Charter.
1.11.1.1. Con: Many Americans know [virtually nothing](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/americans-are-poorly-informed-about-basic-constitutional-provisions?utm_source=news-release&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2017_civics_survey&utm_term=survey&utm_source=Media&utm_campaign=e5f213892a-Civics_survey_2017_2017_09_12&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9e3d9bcd8a-e5f213892a-425997897) about their own constitution. This is no different than the UN Charter.
