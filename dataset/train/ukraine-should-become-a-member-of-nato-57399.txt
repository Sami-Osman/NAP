Discussion Name: Ukraine should become a member of NATO

1. Ukraine should become a member of NATO.
1.1. Pro: Joining the alliance would pull Ukraine further away from Russia’s [sphere of influence](https://theconversation.com/5-things-to-know-about-why-russia-might-invade-ukraine-and-why-the-us-is-involved-175371).
1.1.1. Con: Kyiv \(Ukraine\) is a [historical place for Russian identity](https://www.centeronnationalsecurity.org/vital-interests-issue-47-steven-pifer)(With Ukraine and Russia you have two countries whose history, culture, language, and religion are really intertwined. They both go back to the 10th Century, they both claim Kievan Rus’ as their founding state. Really, from 1654 until 1991, with the exception of a couple of very chaotic years after the end of World War I, Ukraine was part of the Russian empire.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, the part that the Russians missed most was Ukraine. Russians referred to Ukrainians as “little Russians,” which was never very popular with Ukrainians, but many in Russia saw the two as a single country.), therefore it might not be justified to pull Ukraine further away from Russia's influence.
1.1.1.1. Con: Experts have dismissed Putin’s depiction of Russo-Ukrainian unity as [political propaganda](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/disarming-putins-history-weapon/).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a typical appeal to authority \("argumentum ad verecundiam"\) fallacy. You can find "experts" with opposite views on this matter.
1.1.2. Pro: [The purpose of NATO originally was to defend Europe against Russian aggression for these exact reasons](https://www.britannica.com/topic/North-Atlantic-Treaty-Organization)(From its founding, NATO's primary purpose was to unify and strengthen the Western Allies' military response to a possible invasion of western Europe by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies). If Ukraine had become a member, then this war likely wouldn’t have happened.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Russia's power has declined and Putin can’t handle it, so he has [adopted a cold war mentality](https://www.orilliamatters.com/letters-to-the-editor/letter-putin-is-a-thug-stuck-in-past-cold-war-mentality-5101754). This isn’t a game of East vs West. Russia wants to control former colonies and rebuild a dead empire.
1.1.3. Pro: NATO Membership would draw Ukraine more firmly toward Europe, making it more likely that Ukraine could join the European Union
1.1.3.1. Con: There is a significant fraction of Ukraine that [does not want to get closer to Europe but to Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukraines-pro-russian-monasteries-draw-local-suspicion). A better stance for a peaceful co-existence is a neutral one.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The European Commision President Ursula von der Leyen has already stated that "[Ukraine is one of our own and we want them in the EU](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/03/01/621e02c046163f28328b4623.html)."
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The EU and Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine [are engaging in talks about EU Ascension.](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/03/07/EU-agrees-to-start-examining-Ukraine-Georgia-Moldova-membership-requests)(EU nations agreed Monday to start the lengthy process of examining membership bids submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova in the wake of Russia's invasion of its pro-Western neighbour, diplomats said.)
1.2. Con: Regional tensions could be exacerbated if Ukraine becomes a NATO member, as Russia has said it would interpret the alliance’s expansion as a [direct threat](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1072413634/russia-nato-ukraine).
1.2.1. Pro: The regions of [Donetsk and Luhansk](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/15/why-donetsk-and-luhansk-are-at-the-heart-of-the-ukraine-crisis) are against Ukrainian integration.
1.2.2. Pro: On the 15th of March 2022, Ukraine's President Zelensky stated that Ukraine wouldn't be joining NATO, as [it was one of the demands made by Russia before it invaded](https://www.newsweek.com/zelensky-nato-russia-putin-war-ukraine-1688145).
1.2.3. Pro: Going along with previous comments, Russia would see this as a threat and would strike back, escalating.
1.3. Con: If Ukraine were to join NATO, most of Europe would be dragged into the war against Russia, due to [Article 5 of the Washington Treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm)(Collective defence means that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies.\nThe principle of collective defence is enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.).
1.3.1. Con: [Ukraine is an important country within Europe that has close historic ties with Russia](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-crossroads-europe-and-russia), therefore Putin doesn't want to lose an important state out of its sphere of influence.
1.3.2. Pro: If most of Europe was dragged into the war, [NATO wouldn't be able to defend all of its members](http://"If most of Europe was dragged into the war, NATO wouldn't be able to defend all of its members.).
1.3.2.1. Con: No, because if Ukraine enters NATO, Ukraine would also have to contribute money and military, which would improve the alliance.
1.4. Pro: Ukraine has had a [partnership](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_80925.htm) with [NATO since 1992](https://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/98-00/tur.pdf), therefore they should be allowed to join it.
1.4.1. Con: Ukraine [still hasn't fulfilled](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article258774458.html)(“There’s a lot of criteria for NATO membership. Ukraine didn’t really meet any of those, although it was on a path to meeting those,” Monaghan said. “And NATO was helping them meet those targets. There was a path then, but now that seems much, much less likely.”) the requirements needed to become a NATO member.
1.4.2. Pro: [Dialogue and cooperation with NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_37750.htm) started when independent Ukraine joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council \(1991\) and the Partnership for Peace programme in 1994.
1.4.3. Con: Even if in 2020, [Ukraine joined NATO's enhanced opportunity partner interoperability progra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations)(On 12 June 2020, Ukraine joined NATO's enhanced opportunity partner interoperability program. According to an official NATO statement, the new status "does not prejudge any decisions on NATO membership.)m, it does not mean that NATO would give membership to Ukraine.
1.5. Pro: Membership with NATO would significantly increase Ukraine’s international military backing.
1.5.1. Con: There is still the option of becoming a [neutral country.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2022/03/03/a-hail-mary-on-ukraine/)(Ukraine’s joining NATO was never a good idea; it was not going to happen anytime soon even before the events of last week, and it certainly is not going to happen with Russian troops sitting on its soil. The idea goes back to a promise that NATO made to Ukraine, and Georgia, at its 2008 Bucharest Summit that they would be members someday. But there was no timetable, no interim security guarantee, and the condition that new members would only be eligible for membership if they first resolved territorial disputes with neighbors. This translated into a perfectly perverse set of incentives for Moscow to aggress against the two countries, as it has ever since.)
1.5.2. Pro: [Because Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance,](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/nato-what-mean-meaning-name-explained-countries-list-why-ukraine-members-1483494?ico=in-line_link) NATO is [not obligated to launch an armed attack](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-why-no-one-helping-nato-russia-invasion-response-member-countries-1483199) against Russia to protect Ukraine.
1.6. Con: Only if you want World War 3.
