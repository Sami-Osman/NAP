Discussion Name: Should the UK Remain in the EU if the only Alternative is a Hard Brexit?

1. The UK should remain in the EU if a hard Brexit is the only alternative option.
1.1. Pro: A hard Brexit would end Freedom of Movement, and all the associated benefits it brings.
1.1.1. Pro: Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU could technically disappear overnight.
1.1.1.1. Con: If both the UK and individual EU states value the relationship they currently have with each other, they can form bilateral agreements to preserve the conditions required to ensure ease of travel, work and education.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: For individual EU countries to grant the UK the same full open borders as before, the UK would have to reciprocate by opening their own borders too. This is not politically supportable for the UK, as closing down immigration was a major goal of Brexit - there won't be public desire or the political mandate to start re-opening borders.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Public support may exist to open borders with countries more ethnically close to us, like France and Germany, but keep eastern Europeans out.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: An increasing number of EU countries \(most recently [Portugal](https://eutoday.net/news/politics/2019/portugal-to-provide-special-lanes-for-uk-visitors-after-brexit)\) have made unilateral pledges to maintain visa free travel post-Brexit. The countries most likely to carry on this trend are the countries which benefit a great deal from UK tourism; i.e. the countries UK citizens would be most concerned about unrestricted travel to.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The UK can make bilateral arrangements to retain rights as it sees fit. For example, Switzerland and the UK have reached a [bilateral agreement](https://www.thelocal.ch/20181217/switzerland-signs-off-on-post-brexit-trade-agreement-with-uk) that retains trade and residency rights, and the UK and Spain have made [similar bilateral arrangements](https://www.ft.com/content/171ddbb0-1d96-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d),
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Spain has guaranteed British citizens can continue [to live there](http://www.cityam.com/274318/brexit-british-expats-spain-allowed-stay-even-if-no-deal) even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Spain is only one of the roughly 27 other member states of the EU. Most other EU states will require visas from British people and have to comply with that EU legislation. Free movement is for EU people only and if the UK leaves they will forfeit that right for the majority of member states.
1.1.1.2. Con: Spain, which has by far the largest number of UK citizens, has [bilaterally agreed](https://www.ft.com/content/171ddbb0-1d96-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d) [citizens rights](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47412708) with the UK.
1.1.1.3. Pro: A hard Brexit would also harm the ability of Britons to settle in the EU in the future.
1.1.1.4. Pro: British tourists looking to travel Europe would most likely need [visas and security screenings](https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/904036/post-brexit-travel-passport-visa-europe-eurozone). This makes travel more costly and more difficult.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Those visiting the UK from the EU would also have to obtain visas, making it easier to keep an accurate account of who is legally in the UK.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: While that may be positive for immigration, it could have a negative impact on the tourism industry in the UK.
1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Tourism](https://www.visitbritain.org/visitor-economy-facts) in the UK generates 9% of the country's GDP and nearly 10% of jobs. A decline in tourists due to Brexit would damage the UK economy.
1.1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Currently, the UK's [airline routes](http://uk.businessinsider.com/wef-tourism-competitiveness-report-brexit-impact-on-uk-tourism-2017-4) to EU and US destinations are arranged through EU agreements; a hard Brexit could call these into question.
1.1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: As an island nation, transport links are highly important.
1.1.1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: The aviation sector does not have the emergency fall-back option of World Trade Organisation rules which apply to most sectors. As a result, Brexit could [severely reduce](http://uk.businessinsider.com/wef-tourism-competitiveness-report-brexit-impact-on-uk-tourism-2017-4) the number of routes for holidaymakers, business travellers and visitors to the UK.
1.1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: The additional work of procuring a visa may deter people from using the UK as a holiday destination.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: British people spending money abroad through tourism is money leaving the British economy. It is better to have them vacation domestically.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: It is likely that the visa scheme will resemble [the U.S. process](https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/904036/post-brexit-travel-passport-visa-europe-eurozone) which guarantees 90 days upon entry. While this is more difficult than the status quo, [millions](https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/564537/4-million-Brits-travel-US-in-2014-record-breaking-tourism-year-Ireland-overseas-visitors) of tourists still travel from Britain to the U.S. each year.
1.1.2. Con: [Brits don't particularly want to live in the EU](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2690347/Revealed-Where-5million-Brits-live-abroad-1-3million-Australia-four-emigrated-San-Marino.html). None of the top 3 countries that Brits emigrate to are in the EU \(Australia, US, and Canada\).
1.1.2.1. Con: [1.3 million people](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates17.shtml) born in the UK live in other EU countries, according to 2017 estimates from the United Nations \(UN\).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is still less than the number of Brits living in Australia alone and reinforces rather than negates the parent claim. Given the EU27 comprises 27 countries, 450 million people and 15% of global GDP, while Australia had a population and GDP about one 20th the size, this illustrates the vast preference of Brits to live in non-EU countries, which preference is greatly increased even further when retirees are discounted.
1.1.2.2. Con: This may partly be because [the most popular holidays destinations are in the EU](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-uk-remain-in-the-eu-if-the-only-alternative-is-a-hard-brexit-8708/8708.0=8708.1+8708.1011+8708.1173), and people emigrating want to take the chance to live and work somewhere new that they couldn't visit easily otherwise.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The qualities one looks for in a holiday destination are different to those one looks for in a place to settle permanently. That people are familiar with the EU but don't want to live there suggests simply that they don't want to live there. Language and cultural barriers are far more likely reasons for Brits choosing not to live in the EU, with the exception of retirees - who are a special case of immigrant living a lifestyle more similar to that of a holidaymaker.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Given EU countries represent the closest and cheapest travel destinations, this statistic is hardly surprising.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: America is very popular as a tourist destination \(no. 5\) but more than twice as popular for migration as the most popular EU migration destination \(Spain\).
1.1.2.3. Con: Around 900,000 UK citizens are long-term residents of other EU countries \([ONS, 2010 2011](https://fullfact.org/europe/how-many-uk-citizens-live-other-eu-countries/)\).
1.1.2.3.1. Con: [Over 250k](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/investmentspensionsandtrusts/articles/pensionersintheeuanduk/2017-09-05) of these are pensioners, who are effectively on a semi-permanent holiday.  Therefore the number of UK citizens working in the EU is at most just 650k.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: This is a relatively small number considering there are over [1.3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_diaspora) British residents in Australia alone.
1.1.2.3.3. Con: These are not distributed evenly across the EU, and therefore the UK would be better served by dealing with popular destinations on a bilateral basis.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: You can’t negotiate that with part of the EU with any real success, especially in the Schengen zone. You may want to read the basis of negotiations in this briefing. [researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2016-0013/LLN-2016-0013.pdf)
1.1.2.4. Con: Freedom of Movement is not the same as Immigration. By definition it is the ability to move about and work anywhere within the EU.
1.1.3. Pro: Many students studying in the UK will have less exposure to employers outside of the UK, as well as lower opportunities for studying abroad.
1.1.3.1. Con: If there are fewer EU people working in the UK, then there may be more opportunities for students studying there to get a job in the UK.
1.1.4. Con: The right to move and work throughout Europe could still be granted through a standard visa process.
1.2. Pro: A hard Brexit would threaten the UK's domestic security with respect to crime, terrorism and the rule of law.
1.2.1. Pro: The European Arrest Warrants, which [rely](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-home-affairs-subcommittee/news-parliament-2017/arrest-warrant-government-response/) on the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, have reduced the time taken to extradite criminals [from 1 year to just 48 days](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23239493).
1.2.1.1. Con: Refusing to sign an extradition treaty with the UK to effectively preserve the present system would be an example of the EU acting maliciously against the interests of its own citizens. It is right to leave a club as nasty as to endanger lives of its own people rather than compromise with a close ally.
1.2.1.2. Pro: While there are some theoretical alternatives to European Arrest Warrants which could be as efficient, these have [not been](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-home-affairs-subcommittee/news-parliament-2017/arrest-warrant-government-response/) successfully implemented despite years of negotiation.
1.2.1.3. Con: This arrangement need not be dependent on the wide-scale political and economic union that the EU entails. Britain could leave the EU in its totality and then make a bilateral agreement with the EU, which closely resembles the current arrangement. It would be mutually beneficial for the EU and UK to make such an agreement.
1.2.2. Pro: In 2016, UK agencies launched [3,000 investigations](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39272921) at Europol \(the [EU's law enforcement agency](https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/our-thinking)\) into cross-border organised crime and terrorism.
1.2.2.1. Con: Refusing to allow Europol to work with the UK would be an example of the EU acting maliciously against the interests of its own citizens. It is right to leave a club as nasty as to endanger lives of its own people rather than compromise with a close ally.
1.2.2.2. Con: Europol is not crucial in combating terrorism as Intelligence Agencies [rarely share](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39272921) this kind of sensitive information via this avenue.
1.2.3. Pro: A hard Brexit would be particularly dangerous as it might threaten access to some [essential](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39272921) systems such as the [Second Generation Schengen Information System](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen-information-system_en), which is a key tool in countering terrorism.
1.2.3.1. Con: Losing access would be an example of the EU acting maliciously against the interests of its own citizens.  It is right to leave a club as nasty as to endanger lives of its own people rather than compromise with a close ally.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Many aspects of EU counter-terrorism is subject to EU law governed by the ECJ. It would simply be illegal under current EU laws to share information covered by data protection with 3rd nations. Brexit was a vote to become a 3rd nation not subject by EU laws, thus we have voted to [exclude](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/12/britain-falling-behind-eu-terror-fight) ourselves from the sharing of counter-terrorism information.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Revoking access to the benefits of the EU is important to maintain the EU's own collective integrity. An 'exclusive' club that grants all of its benefits to non-members would quickly lose many of its members. Therefore the EU's revocation of the UK's access is simply pragmatic, rather than ''nasty''.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The EU's tough stance when dealing with Brexit has led to decreased demand for similar exits from [other countries](https://www.thelocal.dk/20190104/danish-eu-support-at-record-high-poll).
1.2.3.2. Pro: This system is accessible to individual police officers on the street, and allowed them to identify [over 6,000](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/77/7706.htm) people of interest \(missing, organised crime, etc.\) in the UK between April 2015 and March 2016.
1.2.3.3. Pro: [Counter terrorism](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/77/7706.htm) alerts, which are more discrete than the regular police ones, can also be entered into the system.
1.2.3.4. Pro: This system holds the details of [over 8,000](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/13/brexit-may-britain-terrorists-schengen-information-system) suspected members of ISIS, making it invaluable when it comes to tracking returning foreign fighters.
1.2.3.5. Con: The article quoted says Britain would be unlikely to lose access to these systems: "But shutting Britain out of this club would be counter-productive for the rest of Europe, so officers are confident it will be retained after Brexit."
1.3. Con: Being part of the EU harms British culture.
1.3.1. Pro: The EU projects its own symbols of a shared identity, for example an [anthem and a flag](https://www.coe.int/en/web/tbilisi/the-coe/about-coe/flag-anthem). These [cultural symbols](https://books.google.com/books?id=app9DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=council+of+europe+symbols+impact+on+culture&source=bl&ots=gRCvGO2kdo&sig=arEKdjK954syvTNPUUxw7eJlZd8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtgPfXiYjZAhVDs1kKHaKFA4UQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&q=council%20of%20europe%20symbols%20impact%20on%20culture&f=false) distract from more local and national symbols of culture.
1.3.1.1. Con: The UK contains [five](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cornish-granted-minority-status-within-the-uk) national identities, each with their [own flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_flags), and even some counties within England, such as Lancashire, have their [own flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Lancashire). If someone can consider themselves to be from Lancashire, England, and the United Kingdom, it should not be difficult to also identify as European.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is not a question of difficulty, but of reality. 50% of British people felt they were British to the exclusion of being European \([Standard Eurobarometer, p.30](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/86438)\), and therefore feel that European identity and symbols do not represent them.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: And yet, in the same study 58% reported considered themselves to be a citizen of the EU.
1.3.1.2. Con: The EU indeed has its own flag and anthem to create a shared feeling of being European. This was deliberate to end wars between European states. The EU has been mostly successful in this, but this doesn't override the national flags or anthems.
1.3.2. Con: "British culture", through history, has been defined by its inclusivity, welcoming nature and acceptance of other cultures. Brexit seeks to alter British culture as opposed to Remain, which enshrines it.
1.3.2.1. Pro: British culture is itself an amalgamation of different cultures, including from many EU countries.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Being European is a big part of British culture. British art, food, sports and religions are primarily derived from thousands of years of shared history with other European countries and peoples.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: British people and their culture are fundamentally European. The [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) and even the [Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts) arrived here from Europe. Before the Celts, Britain was [populated by Basques](https://thewildpeak.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/are-the-english-basque/) who arrived from France and Spain. Old English originates from North Sea Germanic, and [Modern English developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_English) through combining Old English with Norse, French, Latin, and Greek.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: British identity, although having indeed been influenced by various cultures over the course of history, is still a unique country, with a specific culture and identity, that cannot be reduced to an amalgamation of different cultures \(which, in the end, could be considered true of all cultures\). After all, it is obvious from a glance, and even more if we dig deeper, that the UK is very different from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, etc.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The UK is in fact a [collection](https://brilliantmaps.com/eng-gb-uk/) of countries \(and a country fragment\) each with its own distinct culture. They borrow from one other, and from their European neighbours.
1.3.2.1.3.2. Con: Italians are different from French \(remember Napoleon?\), Polish are different from Germans \(remember WW2?\). And yet, French, Italians, English, Polish and Germans share common values: human rights, no death row, freedom of speech, public services, democracy \(to mention a few\). The English are different, yes, but not more different than other European nations between them. And at the same time have much more in common compared to other cultures.
1.3.2.2. Con: Britain has historically been ruthless and [discriminatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_mentality#British_India) against the cultures of the people it has colonized.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Colonial bad behaviour against others' cultures has occurred in the colonies, but that does not establish that the same has occurred in Britain.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Britain has internalized many of the cultural practises of the nations of the Commonwealth. For example, [Indian food](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8370054.stm) is now present and readily available throughout Britain.
1.3.3. Con: The greatest effect on 'British culture' would likely occur in [high immigration areas](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138). However, populations in high immigration areas voted overwhelmingly to stay. This suggests that people genuinely affected by changes in British culture are supportive of this change and that British culture has improved.
1.3.3.1. Con: If you look at changes in immigration levels a [different pattern](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/07/14/explaining-the-brexit-vote) emerges. Recent changes in the proportion of immigrants \(even though to smaller absolute numbers\) correlated strongly with voting leave.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: This shift may mean that the areas that voted leave were less equiped to adjust to immigration, thus they were acting off real experience.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: This does not necessarily disprove the parents claim that "perception of migrants has more effect than experience", instead it shows that people do not like change.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: It could be suggested that if the rate of migration in a town like Boston slowed drastically, the town would get used to the new migrants and opinions would move towards that of the other high total immigration areas \(leaning towards remain\).
1.3.3.2. Pro: From this it appears that any negative consequences for culture and national unity are not so much experienced by people who have the most experience with immigrants, but could be just a perception of those without much experience with immigrants.
1.3.3.3. Con: Even if this were true, it would not be surprising that people who have not yet been negatively affected by immigration would be apprehensive of those effects reaching them — as them not living in high immigration areas does not mean they cannot know how immigration affects their country.
1.3.4. Con: EU membership confers benefits and privileges that help preserve British culture.
1.3.4.1. Pro: EU programs are essential to [protecting cultural heritage](https://ec.europa.eu/culture/policy/culture-policies/cultural-heritage_en), including archaeological sites, monuments, museums, and artwork, that distinctively represent the culture within its member states. Brexit would mean that Britain would lose access to these programs which promote British culture.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The Creative Industries Federation \(an association of members from UK creative industries\) states that 96 per cent of its members supported remaining in the EU and 84 per cent of its members believed [the outcome of the referendum](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/07/what-will-brexit-mean-arts-and-culture-uk) was important to the future success of their organisations, as Brexit would result in a loss of EU funding and support for cultural programs.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Protecting archeological sites is almost useless if the overall culture and identity of the country are being diluted.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: The money that the UK \([who contributes more than it receives](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8036802.stm)\) gives to the EU could be used directly in their own country. Leaving the EU would thus be more positive than negative.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: This claim also does not take into account those benefits the UK derives which cannot easily be measured in terms of money, i.e. the increased quality of goods consumed, the efficiencies for companies of having a wider workforce, the healthcare enjoyed by UK pensioners and others in other countries.
1.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The EU could achieve higher efficiencies for the member states because it allows division of labour and higher specialisation \([see Adam Smith](http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/division.html)\). This is the ideal the EU \(ought to\) work towards.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The UK has been part of the EU for over 40 years and still has a distinct culture. This suggests that EU membership is, at the very least, not a threat to British culture.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: There is plenty of [evidence](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al-archive/leap/uklife/britishculture/) that British culture \(however you define it\) is robust enough to withstand outside influence. There is no evidence that Germans are less German or French are less French because of the EU.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Countries even further intregrated into the EU, such as France and Germany, have also been able to maintain their cultural identity.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The EU supports regional culture, and thus regional identity, more than the UK government does.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: The European Capital of Culture Programme has supported regional culture [twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture) in the UK, once in Glasgow and once in Liverpool.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: Between 2015-2016, the UK benefitted from [€11.3 million](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Arts_culture_Sector_exit_from_EU_NOV_16.pdf). In 2018, the total [Arts Council England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Council_England) \(which distributes government arts funds\) budget is £622 million, with the amount spent outside London targeted to rise [from 70% to 75%](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/28/arts-council-england-increase-ratio-funding-outside-london-darren-henley). The EU's support for regional culture is minor compared to the UK's.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Con: The EU budget is [€290](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union) per capita, while the UK government budget is [£9350](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjU1dLWt7PiAhV5VBUIHdSpCLoQFjABegQIDBAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fresearchbriefings.parliament.uk%2FResearchBriefing%2FSummary%2FSN04033&usg=AOvVaw3MXly-AM0e2o5uLzdZmliG) per capita. Thus making a direct comparision between €11m and £622m is extremely disingenuous.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Many British cultural leaders [believe](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/31/brexit-threat-to-arts) that a hard Brexit will hurt their nation's artistic reputation, as it curtails the ability of most British artists to work freely abroad and international artists to work in the UK. This also hurts the perception of the UK as an iconic cultural hub.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: Travel restrictions, which would result from a hard Brexit, will add large financial and logistical costs to touring companies and so prevent many British theatre companies from touring.
1.3.4.4.3. Con: Travelling won’t suddenly become impossible without the EU, and it doesn’t change anything for non-EU artists or British artists travelling outside of the EU.
1.3.4.4.4. Con: Britain’s iconic cultural hub identity is independent from the EU, as it predates it — wether you take into account London being a capital of culture in the 19th century, or the popular culture boom in the[interwar era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_Kingdom#Interwar_era_1918–1939). Believing brexit will hurt the UK as a culture hub is greatly underestimating the country’s appeal and history.
1.3.5. Con: British culture is primarily influenced by America, even as a member of the EU. Many Leave voters take no issue with American influence but protest cultural influence of other regions.
1.3.5.1. Pro: British media is made to be sellable to America as they are the largest and wealthiest English language culture market.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Language barriers make influence from European cultures slow to cross over and even slower to spread, but Americanisation permeates every level of British life.
1.3.5.3. Con: One problem does not negate another, and one could say that at least it’s anglo-saxon culture. The fact is the problem of American influence is a different problem to that of European influence \(especially this notion that the UK doesn’t really have its own culture, and is at best just an amalgam of other cultures — European and otherwise\).
1.3.5.3.1. Con: The Angles, Saxons and Jutes all came from mainland Europe, or from north Germany, Denmark and northern Holland to be more precise. America is itself a huge blend of cultures including German, Italian, Chinese, etc. so suggesting that they are culturally far closer to us is misleading.
1.3.6. Pro: While immigration is not a problem in itself, if it is too large, and too fast, the people coming in [cannot be assimilated](http://www.france24.com/fr/20150501-birmingham-limites-multiculturalisme-anglais-royaume-uni-elections-islam-tensions-communautarisme-small-heath) to the country’s culture. Thus, communities form that live apart from British culture and do not assimilate or identify with it. It harms British culture, and weakens social cohesion indeed.
1.3.6.1. Con: The way UK immigration figures are calculated means that the numbers include a great many people who have no intention of becoming permanent residents of the UK. Students, seasonal workers, etc. form a large part of the "immigrant" population and they all tend to return to their home countries after a short stay. There's no need for such people to be assimilated, and no evidence that their clustering for mutual support while resident here inflicts any damage on British culture.
1.3.6.2. Con: There's no reason why immigrants should be assimilated to the "country's culture". The desire to force them or persuade them to conform to whichever values someone decides to call British and to call them a problem if they don't is racism.
1.3.6.3. Con: The issues raised - too many immigrants in isolated communities leading to lack of integration - are planning issues that could be mitigated bycarefully considered mix-use housing developments in the places where migrant work is required.
1.3.6.4. Con: Culture is organic and evolves constantly, with each generation adding or removing customs and practices. Leaving the EU will do nothing to change this, as migration will still be allowed in both directions, even if in reduced quantities.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: This means the British population will still be exposed to different cultures, customs and practices which each individual is allowed to choose to adopt or not \(if the law permits\).
1.3.6.4.2. Con: The impact of on-screen world, whether television or internet, dwarfs that of real life. We interact much more with devices than we do with our neighbours, making any cultural impact they may have negligible.
1.3.6.4.3. Con: Culture is indeed organic, however it needs time to assimilate various influences to make it its own. The lack of control over immigration policy weakens the ability to control the rate at which people come into the country, which in turn makes it harder to both assimilate immigrants and to integrate eventual cultural influences from them into \(and not on top of\) British culture.
1.3.6.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.3.6.4.3.2. Con: Culture has no sensibilities so it needs no time so presumably this refers to bigots. This is about letting bigotry delay or even stop change.
1.3.6.5. Con: A major proportion of immigrants in the UK are not from the EU, but rather [countries somehow tied in with the British Empire](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/) such as Pakistan, India, South Africa, Bangladesh, Nigeria. The control of borders for these immigrants has been resting with British authorities and is not an EU issue.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: There has been a great [increase of immigration from Europe](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/22/eu-referendum-the-europe-debate-in-numbers/) in the last five to ten years, whether it be [Western, or Eastern Europe](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/#create-graph) \(in particular Bulgaria and Romania\). More accurately, immigration is on a downward trend from non-European countries, whereas immigration from EU-countries has greatly increased. Furthermore, there being strong non-EU immigration doesn’t mean EU-immigration cannot be a problem. Those are two different issues, and should be handled differently.
1.3.6.5.2. Con: A lot of the immigration people were concerned about was illegal immigration, with the current migrant crisis, as the EU has been very lax in controlling its own borders. In this case, once migrants get into the EU, they can pretty much travel anywhere in it without much problems.
1.4. Con: The EU is too dysfunctional for the UK.
1.4.1. Pro: The EU wastes [vast sums of money](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201310/20131025ATT73477/20131025ATT73477EN.pdf) in [decamping](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-20096221/eu-parliament-s-journeys-from-strasbourg-to-brussels) from [Brussels to Strasbourg](https://news.sky.com/story/meps-on-the-move-madness-of-strasbourg-shift-10293596) every month. If the EU is incapable of making the trivial decision to end this waste, then it is not capable of making more consequential decisions.
1.4.1.1. Con: This is not an example of the EU being dysfunctional per se. It is also not a trivial decision, nor particularly challenging. The policy may be annoying and a strange distribution of wealth - one that ultimately benefits both towns at the expense of the entire block - but does not demonstrate dysfunction.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: One function, entrusted to the EU, is to handle the vast sums of money it is given effectively. Therefore, wasting it in this way is a very good example of dysfunctionality.
1.4.1.2. Pro: 91% of MEPs [oppose the commuting](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-European-parliament-move-from-Brussels-to-Strasbourg-once-a-month), with France the only country benefiting.
1.4.1.3. Con: A cost of 0.06% of the overall Budget of the European Union is relatively trivial.
1.4.1.4. Con: The UK government also inefficiently wastes vast sums of money on matters for which trivial decisions could be taken to end it.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: The House of Lords is hugely wasteful as an institution. Its reform should be easy for the Government to achieve.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: The House of Lords has 778 members, vastly more than necessary for its function.
1.4.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The US Senate, whose role is roughly equivalent to the Lords, functions with just 100 members.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: The daily cost to sustain some peers in the Lords is [25 times higher](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-finance-office/2018-19/allowances-expenses-2018-19-month10-january.pdf) than most members of the House of Commons.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: The UK Government has continued to pour money into HS2, despite clear warnings from experts that it is a waste of money and [a lack of public support](https://www.comresglobal.com/polls/quicksilver-media-hs2-poll-feb-2019/).
1.4.2. Pro: The EU has failed to address many of the [economic problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/17/europe-in-turmoil-five-years-of-economic-crisis) that have developed since 2008.
1.4.2.1. Con: It is not an agreed area of EU competence to intervene in sovereign member states' economic affairs. Therefore it is not to be expected that the EU would address member states' internal economic problems. This point appears to conflate EU membership with the adoption of the Euro, which clearly the UK has not joined. And the link in question is very old news.
1.4.2.2. Con: Many countries outside the EU, especially the USA, also suffered a deep recession starting in 2008. Blaming the EU for this is wrong.
1.4.3. Pro: The EU is not democratic.
1.4.3.1. Con: Two of the three pillars of UK governance are unelected, i.e. 'The House of Lords' and ‘The Judiciary’.
1.4.3.2. Pro: One of the most powerful EU bodies, the College of Commissioners, is [not democratically elected](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-ellery/eu-referendum_b_9514608.html).
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The European commission is unelected and have been active since 2007. We may elect our MEPs but the [main policy makers](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/c_2017_6915_final_en.pdf) are still unelected and while they are accountable to the European parliament who can censure their decisions it is by no means a perfect system as it falls to the foibles of international politics.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Commissioners are selected by democratically elected Governments. Having no faith in our Government choosing Commissioners to represent us within the EU suggests that we have no faith in them governing us with the full sovereignty Brexit will deliver.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: The EU is no less democratic than the UK. The British cabinet ministers are unelected; they are selected by the PM.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: One potential Commissioner is [nominated](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_1.3.8.html) by the ruling \(democratically elected\) national government of each member state.  These suggestions are then confirmed by the democratically elected European Parliament.  So, the public vote for their own national government and, in doing so, place their trust in them to choose a suitable Commissioner, in an equivalent way to that which the UK public places their trust in their elected House of Commons to select a suitable Prime Minister.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Con: No one asks their local/national candidates who their pick for EU Commissioner would be let alone lets it influence their vote. People elect them for local/national matters not EU wide direction.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: In the UK with FPTP voting only [twice](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7529) in the last 100 years has the ruling party earned \>50% of the vote. From that the party picks the PM, and then the PM decides the Commissioner. This is too many steps from the people to the Commission for popular will to reasonably be carried out.
1.4.3.2.3. Con: The President of the Commission \(Jean-Claude Juncker\) was elected by the [Spitzenkandidat process](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20150526STO59409/spitzenkandidaten-the-story-of-what-made-last-year-s-ep-elections-different).
1.4.3.3. Con: When passing laws the unelected bureaucrats of the EU work in a [co-decision process](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/13/is-the-eu-undemocratic-referendum-reality-check) with elected representatives of the European Parliament.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: In the UK, civil servants and the House of Lords \(both groups of unelected bureaucrats\) work in a co-decision process with British MPs \(the elected representatives\).
1.4.3.4. Pro: The democratic deficit within the EU has left many feeling disenfranchised and led to the rise of [right wing parties.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/right-social-democracy-dying-europe-afd-far-right-germany)
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Growth of far-right politics is growing around the world, including in America and Australia. This rise has probably much more the effect of the Global Economic Crisis, where people around the world are dissatisfied with wage freezes, greater job insecurity and their politicians austerity policies reducing spending on infrastructure. [Rise of the American Far Right](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-far-right-revival-a-thirty-year-war)
1.4.3.4.2. Con: The rise of right wing parties doesn't make the EU undemocratic.
1.4.3.5. Con: The European Commission acts as the EU's Civil Service. Given most Civil Services requires individuals with specialised skills and training, it is unreasonable to expect them to be elected.
1.4.3.6. Con: Democracy does not necessarily mean the same thing in the EU and the UK. The EU needs to strike a consensus between the different democracies of the Member States, some being coalition systems with multiple parties, some with first-past-the-post systems, etc. The EU cannot have the same type of democracy as a state, because it is a supranational organisation, working for the benefit of citizens and countries.
1.4.3.7. Con: Member states must have [strong democratic institutions](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/accession-criteria_en) in order to join the EU.
1.4.3.7.1. Con: There are four Nazis sitting on the European Parliament, three elected with the Greek [Golden Dawn](http://www.pappaspost.com/refer-greeces-golden-dawn-party-neo-nazi/), and one elected with the German [National Democratic Party](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-18/national-democratic-party-resembles-nazis-but-no-ban/8189930). Their wages are paid by the EU.
1.4.3.7.1.1. Con: Allowing extreme parties is a characteristic of liberal democracy, not a lack of it. Golden dawn and NDP were elected with enough Greek/German votes to earn their position. Proportional representation requirements for MEP elections are designed to allow minorities a voice, no matter how unpleasant that voice may be. Until convicted of a crime, they have the right to become elected in a democracy, so they shouldn't be seen as a point against the EU's democratic institutions.
1.4.3.7.1.1.1. Con: Allowing Nazis to be elected is a characteristic of a liberal democracy, but Nazis actually managing to get elected is testament of weak and corrupt democratic institutions.
1.4.3.7.2. Con: Poland and Hungary have been making increasingly [illiberal and anti-democratic](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/05/hungary-and-poland-arent-democratic-theyre-authoritarian/) changes in their governance over recent years. It is unclear if the EU has the capacity to maintain democracy among its member states.
1.4.3.7.3. Pro: Following Turkey's dramatic shift toward illiberalism, European Commissioner Johannes Hahn [stated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu/turkeys-eu-dream-is-over-for-now-top-official-says-idUSKBN17Y0U0) that its bid to join the EU was effectively finished.
1.4.3.7.3.1. Con: This is no longer [the case.](https://www.ft.com/content/09935e16-a230-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4)
1.4.3.7.3.1.1. Pro: The article states that the EU might attempt to strengthen diplomatic relationships, but does not suggest that this comes anywhere close to the threshold required to join the EU.
1.4.3.7.4. Con: EU's accession criteria doesn't prove or refute the \(un\)democratic nature of the EU itself.
1.4.3.8. Pro: European Parliament elections [suffer](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/europes-democratic-deficit-is-getting-worse/371297/) from low turnouts, and increasingly disengaged electorates.
1.4.3.8.1. Con: This does not make the EU a non-democracy; the [United States](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/15/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) suffers from similarly low voter turnouts.
1.4.3.9. Pro: Even the EU [recognizes](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/democratic_deficit.html?locale=en) that many voters feel it suffers from a democratic deficit.
1.4.3.9.1. Con: The fact that the EU publicly recognizes this is the mark of a responsive governance system.
1.4.3.9.2. Con: The EU has acted to correct this. The democratic basis of the EU has been the European Parliament whose members have been elected by the electorate of the member states. While this is democratic, the electorate places more significance on their votes for their own national government than they do for their MEP, and are subsequently disenchanted that the European Parliament can overrule their national Government. Had the UK not chosen to pursue Brexit this discrepancy would have been [corrected](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/73195/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-A%20vote%20to%20leave%20the%20EU%20may%20have%20a%20detrimental%20impact%20on%20Parliament.pdf).
1.4.3.9.3. Con: The public opinion about the democratic deficit in the EU doesn't necessarily reflect reality.
1.4.3.10. Con: Democracy is not a guarantee of functionality.
1.4.3.10.1. Pro: The Chinese Government is relatively functional, despite there being virtually no democracy in China.
1.4.3.10.1.1. Pro: The Chinese government, which has no real democratic obligations or accountability, is far better at investing in long term [infrastructure growth projects](https://www.kpmg.de/docs/Infrastructure_in_China.pdf).
1.4.3.10.1.2. Pro: China was given a 0 score for ''Electoral Process and Pluralism" in the [ECU's Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
1.4.3.10.1.3. Pro: From [1960-2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(real\)_per_capita_growth_rate), China had the highest average annual growth rate at 6.61% of any country in the world.
1.4.3.10.2. Pro: Ukraine has relatively strong democratic institutions and yet has also been ranked as the [9th most corrupt](https://fraudsurveys.ey.com/ey-global-fraud-survey-2018/detailed-results/) in a survey of 55 countries.
1.4.3.11. Con: The European Union Parliament is elected using [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament), ensuring it is more democratic than the UK's own parliament.
1.4.3.12. Con: The EU's democratic legitimacy is also derived from participation of democratic national governments and leaders in the decision-making process. Some [EU decisions](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-proposal-for-a-council-decision-establishing-provisional-measures-in-the-area-of-international-prote.html#/##vote_list_tabs_content_1) are taken on an international basis and excludes Parliament \(supranational legislature\) from the decision-making process.
1.4.3.13. Pro: Due to its large population and dominating economy, Germany has had [major influence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-germany-influence-insight/insight-merkels-europe-how-her-men-run-brussels-idUSBRE99N05320131024) over the vast majority of EU policies, much to the [dissatisfaction](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/796149/Eurozone-EU-dominance-Brussels-France-Germany-Merkel-Macron) of other member states.
1.4.3.13.1. Con: The same could be said about British politics, where labour and conservative political parties have major control and influence, to the dissatisfaction of other parties/independants.
1.4.3.13.2. Pro: Germany has been the principal [force](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/31/growth-decide-eurozones-future-greek) behind EU austerity measures throughout the Eurozone, particularly in Greece.
1.4.3.13.2.1. Con: Greece has a huge culture of [Tax Evasion](https://www.dianeosis.org/en/2016/06/tax-evasion-in-greece/) which it has been reluctant to tackle, as well as hiding its [debt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16834815) from the EU when it joined. The EU could not afford to continue bailing out Greece to the cost of other nation states including Britain when it made no real attempt at tackling it's own economic problems.
1.4.3.13.3. Con: Large and powerful states/regions typically have power over smaller and weaker ones, irrespective of their place in/out of the EU.
1.4.3.13.3.1. Pro: England and London similarly have a huge influence over UK politics, much to the dissatisfaction of other areas.
1.4.3.13.3.1.1. Pro: HS2 is a project that would primarily benefit London, and is [opposed by the vast majority](https://www.comresglobal.com/polls/quicksilver-media-hs2-poll-feb-2019/) of people living in northern communities
1.4.3.13.3.2. Pro: Under any reasonable democratic system, a larger share of the population should equate to a larger degree of political leverage.
1.4.3.13.4. Con: Influence or soft power might differ among EU member states, but each EU member state has only one vote in the EU Council and European Council. Therefore decisions are taken democratically with a consent of majority member states.
1.4.3.14. Pro: The EU is anti-democratic. It routinely attempts to enforce its will on member states regardless of democratic direction, as it did regarding Ireland's vote against the Lisbon Treaty. If Britain wishes to have political power, rights and freedoms, it must leave the EU. [The Guardian on the Lisbon Vote](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/13/eu-ireland-lisbon-treaty)
1.4.3.14.1. Pro: This has happened [three times](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/19/asking-the-public-twice-why-do-voters-change-their-minds-in-second-referendums-on-eu-treaties/) in EU referendums – in Denmark on the Maastricht Treaty in 1992-3, Ireland on the Nice Treaty in 2001-2, and Ireland again on the Lisbon Treaty in 2008-9.
1.4.3.14.2. Con: For all three repeated EU referendums, the governments [sought reassurances](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/10/19/asking-the-public-twice-why-do-voters-change-their-minds-in-second-referendums-on-eu-treaties/) from the EU on the controversial themes of the first campaign. This allowed them to ask the same question again, but address the issues raised by the initial vote.
1.4.3.14.3. Con: Scotland hasn't voted for a Conservative Government in decades and yet are generally controlled by Tories in Westminster. Being in a political union will inevitably involve compromises as well as benefits.
1.4.3.14.4. Con: The situation in Ireland [changed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5638510/Why-Ireland-is-primed-to-reverse-its-Lisbon-Treaty-vote.html) after they voted against the Lisbon treaty so they put it to the vote again. It is a strange kind of democracy that cannot allow the electorate to change their mind.
1.4.4. Con: Brexit is the ultimate expression of dysfunction and the EU an example of stability and union.
1.4.5. Con: Since it has been shown that being an EU member is beneficial to the UK and the cost to the individual citizen minimal, then the efficiency, or lack of, of it's process is irrelevant.
1.4.6. Con: In some cases it is the EU that protects British citizens from their own Government's dysfunction.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The EU may in fact protect the citizens of the UK, through legal oversight, from the negative effects of poor policy making or implementation. Vulnerable and marginalised groups [have used](https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/28/3/763/4616672#100347677) the European Court of Justice to bring numerous claims against the British Government for human rights abuses.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: The EU has created [many directives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_labour_law#Equality) which encourage equal opportunities for ethnic minorities across Europe.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: The EUs [European Convention on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Article_14_%E2%80%93_discrimination) is a key legislation for preventing gender/ethnic discrimination, amongst many other similar areas.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1. Con: The ECHR is enforced by the Council of Europe, which is a completely different organisation to the EU.  The [UK will still be signed up to the ECHR](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-uk) when it leaves the EU.
1.4.6.1.1.2. Pro: The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides some [Human Rights which would be lost](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-uk) if we leave the EU as proposed under the [Repeal Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-repeal-bill-white-paper).
1.4.7. Con: Dysfunction is completely subjective. Who's to say what is normal for a union of countries like those in Europe. The fact that they exist and have 28 member states strongly suggests that they are not, "[deviating from the norms of social behavior in a way regarded as bad](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dysfunctional)."
1.4.7.1. Pro: The UK has [seriously influenced](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/brexit-britain-uk-eu-europe-influence-history-second-world-war-a8711586.html) the way EU works. If the EU is dysfunctional, then it is partly UKs fault, and as such the UK ought to help develop functionality within the union rather than fleeing from its own mess.
1.4.7.2. Con: If the structure of the EU leads to harmful externalities for its member states, this should be a relevant factor in the decision for the UK to remain or leave in the event of a hard Brexit.
1.4.8. Con: The UK would need to replace many of the EU's policies and institutions. These replacements will likely end up being more dysfunctional than the existing ones.
1.4.8.1. Pro: The course and outcome of negotiations on Brexit on both sides suggest that the [UK is more dysfunctional than the EU](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2018/07/13/brexits-institutional-irony-how-the-eu-has-successfully-outflanked-the-uk/). Hence leaving the EU for this reason is illogical.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: It is not reasonable to gauge the organization of entire administrations based on the conduct of their small negotiation teams.
1.4.8.2. Pro: The Windrush scandal [illustrates](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/25/number-of-windrush-cases-passes-5000-mark) how [incompetent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-parliaments-43791047) the Home Office is.
1.5. Pro: A hard Brexit will hurt the scientific community in the UK.
1.5.1. Con: Brexit will increase International non-EU collaborations as the interventionist EU policies incentivising collaboration with other EU groups to the detriment of non-EU groups will dissipate.
1.5.1.1. Con: There are a series of [structural reasons](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) which make international collaborations within the EU effective. It is unlikely that collaborations outside the EU can replicate these conditions.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The centralised funding [substantially reduces bureaucracy](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) when it comes to arranging international collaborations.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The shared political interest in promoting EU science means that the [best laboratory](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) can be chosen to perform a particular task without preferentially selecting national funding for work in the country it is sourced from.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Centralised funding means that there is [less risk](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) in engaging in international collaborations, as there is no chance that your collaborator may lose, or fail to acquire, funding.
1.5.1.2. Con: There is [no indication](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/05/debunking-the-myths-about-british-science-after-an-eu-exit/) that the EU reduces other international collaborations, as it already works with 170 countries around the world.
1.5.1.3. Con: International collaboration is already the core of scientific research. There has been no evidence presented that Brexit can improve that in any way.
1.5.1.4. Con: If Marmite was suddenly taxed heavily, you could expect sales of Vegemite to increase. That doesnt change the fact that people were CHOOSING marmite and are now having their preferences impacted by regulation. This claim does not attack the parent claim. Unless it also suggests that non EU collaborations are inherently more valuable. IE Vegemite is somehow superior to Marmite.
1.5.1.5. Pro: Many projects funded under the EU's Horizon 2020 fund [require collaboration between at least 3 organisations from at least 3 EU \(or associated\) states](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm), prioritizing intra-EU collaboration over the preferences of the researchers themselves.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: The Horizon fund says that "participants from all over the world ... can participate in most of the calls of Horizon 2020". It specifically supports and encourages international collaboration.
1.5.1.5.2. Con: Whilst the UK is a net contributor overall, the [amount it receives in research funding](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/uk-research-and-european-union/role-of-EU-in-funding-UK-research/how-much-funding-does-uk-get-in-comparison-with-other-countries/) is [greater than the proportion](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-research-funding-uk/) of its funding that goes to research from contributions the EU pot
1.5.1.5.3. Con: Even if the UK withdrew £x for research and put it directly in its own pot for research \(as opposed to funding those NHS budget claims\), that funding would be subject to its own criteria \(maybe even to support projects that worked with EU states in order to maintain the research links post-brexit\).
1.5.1.5.4. Con: Horizon 2020 is not the only research grant available.
1.5.1.5.5. Con: Horizon 2020 serves as an example of a research avenue that the UK might not be able to access in the future.
1.5.1.5.5.1. Pro: Some UK researchers report that they have already been '[frozen out](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36835566)' of making grant applications to Horizon 2020, the EU's Research and Innovation programme.
1.5.2. Con: A proportion of current EU-funded non-UK EU scientists who are working in the UK will have been hired over non-EU \(and potentially UK\) scientists for reasons of [administrative ease, visa quotas, funding stipulations etc](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/non-eu-scholars-struggling-with-the-uks-visa-policy/2010106.article) rather than on merit alone. Post-Brexit, non-EU individuals will not be structurally disadvantaged relative to EU individuals.  Hiring foreign scientists based solely on merit rather than citizenship will increase the quality of the scientific research carried out in the UK.
1.5.2.1. Con: Money is an issue, however. A significant portion of the funding which is required for those jobs comes from EU sources. The figures vary from sector to sector, but it is roughly [15%](https://fullfact.org/education/how-much-money-do-british-universities-get-eu/) in [general funding](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2016/university-funding-explained.pdf), and according to Universities UK, [overall EU research funding generated over 19,000 full-time-equivalent jobs in the UK in 2014/2015](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2016/economic-impact-of-eu-research-funding-in-uk-universities.pdf) \(p4\). Thus, leaving the EU might mean prioritising non-EU hires in theory, but the money to hire them would be reduced.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: No funding is guaranteed, and the EU could equally have withdrawn it in the future.  As the UK is a net payer into the EU, this funding is really UK money, anyway.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Quantity does not mean quality when it comes to scientific research.
1.5.2.2. Con: The administrative cost of bringing in non-EU citizens will not improve as a result of a hard Brexit. However it will be more costly to bring in EU scientists, meaning that overall quality could be hurt.
1.5.3. Pro: [Polling from the Campaign for Science and Engineering in 2015](http://www.epc.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/151214-FINAL-EPC_CaSE_Research-and-EU-Report_Dec-2015.pdf) showed that over 90% of scientists felt that EU membership was a *major* benefit to science and research \(pg. 1\). Many leading scientists have publicly called for a second referendum or to abort Brexit entirely; almost none support hard exit.
1.5.3.1. Pro: [97%](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181023110732232) of UK scientists believe that a hard Brexit would have negative outcomes for science in the UK.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The scientists in this survey were all staff from the biomedical research lab, [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181023110732232). As such, this finding may not be representative of all UK scientists who work across a plethora of different fields.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Scientists are well-placed to assess the impact of a hard Brexit on the scientific community because they have first-hand experience of it.
1.5.4. Pro: Brexit will reduce the numbers of scientists in the UK.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Ending free movement will restrict the ability of scientists to work across international boundaries and reduce the pool of scientists from which UK institutions can be drawn.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Most immigration systems, such as [Australia](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5899247/Australia-announces-change-points-general-skilled-migration.html), allow skilled workers like scientists to travel quite freely.
1.5.4.1.2. Con: In September 2019, PM Boris Johnson announced that he would create a [fast-track visa system](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49282689) to attract foreign scientists to UK institutions.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: Foreign scientists are unlikely to be persuaded to come to the UK just because the fast-track visa system makes it easier to get there because [there remain deeper issues](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/uk-scientist-visa-post-brexit-boris-johnson/) faced by the scientific community upon arrival.
1.5.4.2. Pro: More than [half of all scientists](https://www.nature.com/news/brexit-vote-drives-uk-academics-to-think-about-leaving-1.21259) reported that Brexit had increased the likelihood of them leaving. This was even higher for non-UK EU citizens, at over three quarters.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: "More likely" does not mean "likely" or indicate how much more likely.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: It is common for people to overestimate the impact that political votes will have on their future actions.
1.5.4.3. Pro: [31,000 academics](https://www.nature.com/news/brexit-by-the-numbers-the-fear-of-brain-drain-1.21142), or about 16% of the university-based workforce, are non-UK EU citizens. A hard Brexit could jeopardise their residency rights.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: Many academic staff currently do not earn [enough money](https://www.nature.com/news/brexit-by-the-numbers-the-fear-of-brain-drain-1.21142) to qualify for a tier 2 visa for skilled workers.
1.5.4.3.2.1. Con: As a sovereign country the UK can adjust its visa system to meet its needs.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Applications to UK-based scientific research programs by foreign nationals have dramatically [dropped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-08/brexit-guts-british-science-and-risks-graphene-innovation)(Every year Geim receives a steady flow of applications from abroad seeking to join the Marie Curie research program in Manchester. In 2017 he has received no applications at all.) since the referendum.
1.5.4.5. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.2.
1.5.5. Pro: Brexit will reduce EU collaborations.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.5.5.2. Con: Some notable collaborations, such as [CERN](http://www.epsnews.eu/2016/07/cern-statement-about-uk-referendum-on-the-eu/), are not contingent upon EU membership.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Outside the European Union, Britain will no longer [host](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/researchers-deplore-uk-decision-leave-european-union) the European Medicines Agency, which evaluates medicinal products throughout the EU and has 890 employees. Instead the Agency and those scientists will [relocate](http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2017/11/WC500238862.pdf) to Amsterdam.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: This will not affect scientific research in the UK, and so only affects an extremely small proportion of the scientific community.
1.5.5.4. Con: Non-EU [scientists](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2091490-vote-brexit-and-british-science-will-still-be-a-powerhouse/) from Israel and Switzerland have been part of the European Research Council. There is no reason Britain's scientists cannot do the same after Brexit.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: Israel and Switzerland win more [funding](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/championship-form-uk-leads-european-research-council-cash) per capita than UK researchers, and have similar success rates when attempting to obtain grants.
1.5.5.4.1.1. Con: Switzerland \(2.8 percent\) and Israel \(4.4 percent\) spend proportionally [more](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated) of their GDP on R&D than Britain \(1.7 percent\), making it easier for them to obtain research grants from the EU. It is unlikely that the UK will match them in spending anytime soon, given the economic consequences of Brexit.
1.5.5.4.2. Con: These associate members attend Research Council meetings in an [observer](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated) capacity only, and consequently their abilities to shape research policy are limited.
1.5.5.5. Pro: The UK [won](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/apr/06/eu-brexit-scientific-impact-complicated) research grants valued at €1.7 billion during the last funding period of the European Research Council. By contrast, Germany won grants valued at €1.1 billion.
1.5.5.5.1. Con: The ERC is not the only source of funding for UK scientific research, and so even if these funds are lost \(which is not necessarily the case as other non-EU countries receive ERC funds\) they could be compensated for through other sources.
1.5.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.4.1.
1.5.5.6. Pro: Between 2015 and 2019, the amount of EU science fellows choosing UK universities dropped from [33% to 22%](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/10/split-decisions-how-brexit-has-taken-toll-five-researchers). This trend is likely to continue under a hard Brexit.
1.5.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.5.5.1.
1.5.6. Pro: Britain receives around 60% more money from the EU for research funding than it contributes to the EU for research \(Royal Society [pg. 12](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/eu-uk-funding/uk-membership-of-eu.pdf)\).
1.5.6.1. Con: It is unlikely that the loss of EU control over the funding of British science will cause any harm. UK universities were good at science before the UK joined the EU, and will likely continue to remain so.
1.5.6.2. Con: Since the UK is a [net contributor](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7886) to the EU to the tune of £8.9bn, so any EU money science programs lose can be replaced by the UK government funding them directly.
1.5.7. Con: The UK can have better scientific research outside the EU as evidenced by the fact that many countries outside the EU have better scientific research programmes than many countries inside the EU.
1.5.7.1. Con: Research in EU-member states has developed massively thanks to the presence of [EU-funded projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Sk%C5%82odowska-Curie_Actions) and its supra-national institutes \(such as [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/)\). Many of these have [premises in UK](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Brexit will change this mainly for UK, as researchers that are working in the aforementioned projects will relocate to EU-member states.
1.5.7.2. Con: [Causation/Correlation Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation): The fact that other countries have better X \(scientific research programs\) than countries with characteristic Y \(membership within the European Union\) does not mean that success in X \(scientific research programs\) is causally related to Y \(membership within the European Union\) in any way.
1.5.7.3. Pro: Nations such as Australia and the United States currently [recruit](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2091490-vote-brexit-and-british-science-will-still-be-a-powerhouse/) more international researchers than Britain, which shows that membership in a supranational organization is not a prerequisite for success in this regard.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: False Equivalency: Australia and the United States are not Britain. This claim assumes that being removed from the EU will make Britain like the United States or Australia. There is no rational reason to make that assumption.
1.5.8. Con: The UK scientific community will no longer be beholden to burdensome EU regulations.
1.5.8.1. Con: There are relatively few EU regulations on research that the UK would not also implement.
1.5.8.1.1. Pro: Development of new biological weapons, heavily restricted under EU law, is unlikely given that the UK was the proposer of the original [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention).
1.5.8.1.2. Pro: Additional EU law governing animal experimentation was pushed heavily by the UK. UK law was already strict, but [a central aim of the revised legislation was to raise standards of oversight and animal use in other Member States](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/eu-uk-funding/phase-3/EU-regulation-and-policy-in-governing-UK-research.pdf).
1.5.8.1.3. Pro: The UK has been far more stringent in its application of the [Clinical Trials Directive](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/eu-uk-funding/phase-3/EU-regulation-and-policy-in-governing-UK-research.pdf) than other EU members.
1.5.8.2. Pro: At present, EU state aid [regulations](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/11/19/britains-biotech-industry-stifled-strict-eu-aid-rules/) limit the ability of UK funding bodies to support transnational research from universities into start up companies. Leaving the EU will remove this problem.
1.5.8.3. Con: EU regulations ensure research is undertaken in a safe, sustainable, ethical and accountable way.
1.5.8.4. Con: For example, the 'burdensome' EU regulations that prevent pesticides that devastate biodiversity from being used freely across Europe, thereby protecting the environmental resources on which scientific research \(and a lot more\) depends. It's policies like these, that benefit everyone \(except the likes of Monsanto\)[, that the British government seeks to block](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/22/tories-aim-block-full-eu-ban-bee-harming-pesticides)
1.5.9. Con: The impact of a hard Brexit on the scientific community will likely be cushioned by increased domestic spending on UK science.
1.5.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.2.
1.5.9.2. Pro: The UK government has committed to investing [2.4% of GDP](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/researchanddevelopmentexpenditure/bulletins/ukgrossdomesticexpenditureonresearchanddevelopment/2017) in the Research & Development \(R&D\) sector by 2027. This is significantly more than the current investment of 1.7%.
1.5.9.2.1. Con: The current government's spending of just 1.7% of GDP on R&D is already significantly less than the EU recommendation of [2.07%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/researchanddevelopmentexpenditure/bulletins/ukgrossdomesticexpenditureonresearchanddevelopment/2017). Therefore, the UK government has a history of falling short on R&D investment, suggesting that its commitment to 2.4% by 2027 may not be met.
1.5.9.2.2. Con: A lot can politically and economically change before 2027 so this commitment is not guaranteed.
1.5.9.3. Pro: By 2021, the UK government aims to boost investment in R&D by £7 billion, representing the largest ever increase in public funding of R&D by any UK government \([Industrial Strategy, p. 67](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664563/industrial-strategy-white-paper-web-ready-version.pdf)\).
1.5.9.4. Pro: In 2016, [Chancellor Philip Hammond](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37060430) announced that the UK Treasury would replace EU funds for scientists.
1.6. Con: The UK should be able to control and limit its immigration policy as it sees fit.
1.6.1. Con: The UK can sufficiently control immigration while remaining in the EU.
1.6.1.1. Pro: [EU regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/mar/29/eu-dangerous-criminals-allowed-free-entry-uk-vote-leave-claims) already allow countries to reject people with a criminal record.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: [According to the same source](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/mar/29/eu-dangerous-criminals-allowed-free-entry-uk-vote-leave-claims), the law states “previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures” \(i.e., for refusing entry to such a person\), adding extra standards for evaluating criminals on a case-by-case basis.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a positive thing, as it gives choice and control to UK border staff. Either alternative \(no ability to stop criminals / no ability to accept criminals\) would be worse for the UK than the current situation: getting to decide itself.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Convicted criminals can be [excluded](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/mar/29/eu-dangerous-criminals-allowed-free-entry-uk-vote-leave-claims) on a case-by-case basis if they present “a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society”.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Member States, like the UK, can restrict entry and residence of EU citizens on grounds of public policy or public security \([art 27 and further CD](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038)\). This is understood as 'genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society'. Although to be interpreted restrictively, based on the personal conduct of the individual, it is to be read in light of the national needs of the Member State. \(see cases 30/77[Bouchereau](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/showPdf.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30dd789656d3536448358ccef87255e02c57.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyOa3j0?text=&docid=89572&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=233337) and 41/74 [Van Duyn](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61974CJ0041)\)
1.6.1.3. Con: The number of Romanians and Bulgarians living in the UK [has increased by over 80% since 2014](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/964654/Romanians-UK-immigration-levels-2018-EU-Blair-Poles-immigrants) to over 400,000 as a result of EU open border immigration laws. This is unprecedented, was not anticipated \(even Nigel farage underestimated the numbers that would come\) and would not have happened had the UK had full control of immigration.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: It was consecutive UK governments who decided not to restrict residency rights without proof of sustainable work of EU immigrants. The EU is not responsible for the UK lack of regulations. Immigrants who work and pay taxes however contribute hugely to the UK economy.
1.6.1.4. Pro: The UK [already](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=460) has the [ability](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/fact-figures/what-is-freedom-of-movement/) to control immigration. It has chosen not to. The fact that there is no enforcement of these rules in the UK is not the fault of of the EU.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Other EU nations like Austria currently [restrict EU migrants](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria#visas-and-residency) using existing EU laws. Theresa May merely chose not to do so when she was Home Secretary. Brexit was never necessary to restrict migration from the EU.
1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: Austria's laws only restrict EU migrants that aren't working/studying/able to support themselves. The vast majority of EU migrants to the UK are employed, and so these laws would do next to nothing to restrict migration from the EU. Therefore Brexit is absolutely necessary to restrict EU migration.
1.6.1.4.1.1.1. Con: There is no consensus between Leave voters as to what controls on immigration should be put in place. Some insist that immigration was never the issue, some want only to restrict the unemployed being a burden on the country, others go much further insisting that we have "No room". If migrants are working then they are contributing to British society and paying towards new schools, housing, the NHS, etc.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: The UK government has failed to implement the measures allowed by the EU, when it could have. Brexit will enable it to continue to fail to do so. [Farage Admits UK could have controlled EU immigration.](https://twitter.com/Femi_Sorry/status/938456838940643332)
1.6.1.4.3. Pro: The UK previously chose to let in higher numbers of EU migrants than they had to, as the result of their own immigration policy.
1.6.1.4.3.1. Pro: The UK was [one of only three](https://theconversation.com/the-huge-political-cost-of-blairs-decision-to-allow-eastern-european-migrants-unfettered-access-to-britain-66077) EU member states, alongside Sweden and Ireland, to open its labour market to the new 2004 Eastern European EU citizens \(EU10, including the A8\) immediately.
1.6.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: [EU rules allowed](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpb21/reports/HomeOffice25_03.pdf) existing member states 2+3+2 years of their own restrictions, and to suspend free movement of workers if they experienced or anticipated serious disturbances to their labour market.
1.6.1.4.3.2. Pro: [Tony Blair made a 2004 deal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458492/Revealed-Blair-made-deal-with-Romanian-PM-to-let-in-migrants.html) with Romanian prime minister Adrian Nastase [accepting more migrants](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/964654/Romanians-UK-immigration-levels-2018-EU-Blair-Poles-immigrants) in order to manipulate Asylum application figures to make good on earlier promises, rather than trying to resolve the problem properly.
1.6.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Blair's deal was short lived, and it was reversed by the UK government in [2006](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/25/immigrationandpublicservices.eu). As a consequence of Romania then joining the EU and EU migration law, the UK government lost the power to restrict migration from Romania from [2014](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25565302), tying the hands of future UK governments who were then unable to change it despite the [democratic desire to do so](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/). This illustrates the fundamentally undemocratic way the EU project operates.
1.6.1.4.3.3. Pro: Opening borders to eastern european migrants was in keeping with Labours 1997–2010 immigration policies, which had always focused on [expanding immigration and removing restrictions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1045711?journalCode=cjms20), to encourage the economic benefits of increased migration.
1.6.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Under Blair’s Labour government, Britain’s economic immigration policy went from a highly restrictive approach to [one of the most expansive in Europe](https://theconversation.com/how-new-labour-made-britain-into-a-migration-state-85472). It resulted in Immigration five times higher than under the previous government.
1.6.1.4.3.4. Pro: EU rules allow the UK to require migrants to become [self-sufficient within 3 months](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07) of arriving \(excluding students and families\), but the [UK does not](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-bird/immigration-blame-the-uk-_b_13120104.html) register migrants as they arrive and as such has no way of knowing how long they have been in the UK.
1.6.1.4.3.4.1. Pro: There are no efforts to track or control this movement. The [Home Office has admitted](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10361971/Britain-admits-it-has-no-figures-on-EU-welfare-tourist-numbers.html) it does not even know how many EU citizens are in Britain and eligible for welfare.
1.6.1.4.4. Pro: The UK, Ireland and Denmark [have opt-outs](http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/05/can-uk-opt-out-of-mandatory-eu-refugee.html?m=1) from parts of EU justice and home affairs \(JHA\) policy. They could use those opt-outs to avoid the European Agenda on Migrations mandatory burden-sharing, if they wanted to.
1.6.1.4.5. Con: The only instance in which the UK can deny entry to an EU citizen is on security grounds, such as when the person who tries to enter is a criminal. Other than that, the UK has absolutely no control over the people that seek entry to the UK. And as for the people who want to stay in the UK, but they don't satisfy the conditions pointed out in [Article 7 of the Free Movement Directive](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07), they can still enter if they have a family member residing in the UK that satisfies these conditions.
1.6.1.5. Pro: EU citizens only have the right to reside in the UK for longer than 3 months if they work, or if they are self-sufficient \(including dependents\), students, or accompanying family members - [Article 7 of the Citizenship Directive](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07).
1.6.1.5.1. Con: While the claim is true that as a nation we could assert controls on EU migrants who are not financially independent, we're reliant on EU law to do this and we would still be restricted in our ability to control the flow of EU workers.
1.6.1.5.2. Con: EU spouses of UK citizens who earn less than £18,600 are still able to live in the UK and burden the social system, whereas [non-EU spouses are not](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/reports/the-minimum-income-requirement-for-non-eea-family-members-in-the-uk-2/).
1.6.1.5.2.1. Con: EU-originating benefit tourism was not one of the major factors in the Brexit referendum, and so is largely incidental to this debate.
1.6.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Benefit tourism is important to the electorate, and therefore plays an important part in the publics decision to Leave/Remain. [76%](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10570559/The-public-crave-a-crackdown-on-welfare-tourism.-But-are-they-deluded.html) said they would support a two year benefits ban for immigrants \(2014\).
1.6.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.4.3.4.
1.6.1.5.4. Pro: The UK [could limit 'benefit tourism'](https://brexit853.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/powers-that-the-uk-has-failed-to-use-to-control-eu-freedom-of-movement-directive/) from EU countries if it desired to do so, by using [Article 7 of the Citizenship Directive](http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/CitizensRightsDirective/ByPage/Article_07).
1.6.1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.5.2.1.
1.6.1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.4.3.4.
1.6.1.5.4.3. Con: There are many other reasons to exclude someone from coming to your country other than that they will be a burden on your state. Two reasons in particular would be if they were not a good cultural fit, or they posed a national security risk.
1.6.1.5.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.1.5.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.2.
1.6.1.5.5. Pro: The UK does not need to leave the EU in order to deport migrants after 3 months unless they can demonstrate that they are employed/self-sustaining. EU rules already permit member countries to do this, but successive British governments have opted not to implement or enforce this rule. The 3 month permitted period facilitates short term travel e.g. tourism. Migrants are not eligible for any state benefit during this time so that such visitors are in no way a cost to the UK.
1.6.1.5.6. Con: It is not enough for the UK to maintain partial control. These rules significantly infringe on the UK's ability to regulate immigration as it sees fit, which de-prioritizes the national interest.
1.6.1.5.6.1. Pro: An uncontrolled influx of cheap labour suppresses wages and benefits business owners at the expense of the working classes.
1.6.1.5.6.1.1. Con: There is a national minimum wage employers have to abide by, failure to do this for EU citizens would be breaking the law. Obviously this is harder to account for being paid for 'cash in hand' but this is something to target those businesses and traders over, not those willing to work.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Studies find a correlation between an influx of migrants and lower native wage levels.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: The Bank of England [found](https://fullfact.org/immigration/does-immigration-reduce-wages/) that a 10% increase in the proportion of foreign born workers in lower paid service jobs was associated with a near 2% fall in average pay for those jobs, when focusing on particular regions.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.1.1. Con: The study says: "This is a relatively small effect" comparing it to "global changes in technology and trade, or national differences in education, attitudes to gender, and union activity".
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.1.2. Con: It's possible that companies would go out of business or [reduce](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47083214) the [scale](https://www.gov.scot/publications/sectoral-impact-analysis-brexit-readiness-assessment/pages/5/) of their business without seasonal migrant workers and thus that many people \(including natives\) would be left without an income at all.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The population as a whole will also be without the product of those businesses, much of which will be locally produced food.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: This will increase carbon emissions as produce is transported further.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.2. Con: A meta study on the subject found concensus that whilst this effect is statistically signifigant, it is much [smaller](https://papers.tinbergen.nl/04134.pdf) than what is expected.
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.3. Con: A study [Borjas \(2003, p1335\)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25053941?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) found that "the measured impact of immigration on the wage of native workers fluctuates widely from study to study, but seems to cluster around zero".
1.6.1.5.6.1.2.4. Con: The impacts of immigration on the labour market [critically depend](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-labour-market-effects-of-immigration/) on the skills of migrants, the skills of existing workers, and the characteristics of the host economy. They also differ between the short and long run when the economy and labour demand can adjust to the increase in labour supply.
1.6.1.5.6.1.3. Pro: Studies show access to migrant labour benefits business.
1.6.1.5.6.1.3.1. Pro: The [IMF](https://blogs.imf.org/2016/10/24/migrants-bring-economic-benefits-for-advanced-economies/) argues that migration makes sense economically, regardless of the political considerations.
1.6.1.5.6.1.4. Con: The impact of migration on the wages of the UK-born in the semi-skilled and unskilled sector since 2004 has been about [1 percent](https://www.ft.com/content/0deacb52-178b-11e6-9d98-00386a18e39d), over a period of eight years. This is not only an insignificantly small decrease over a large period of time, it is certainly not something worth trading off the benefits of migration for.
1.6.1.5.6.1.4.1. Con: It is easy to say that wage repression is insignificant when it is not yourself on the breadline. The studies referred to in the parent shows that immigration reduces wages at the very bottom where small amounts matter and takes no account of inflation: 1% actual decrease is quite a significant loss in real terms against rising costs and prices.
1.6.1.5.6.2. Pro: An uncontrolled flux of migrant workers makes it difficult for Government to plan for and train citizens in critical industries to prevent skills shortages.
1.6.1.5.6.2.1. Con: The UK has [skills shortages](http://www.theirishworld.com/skills-shortages-eu-workers-shun-brexit-britain/) and [requires](https://www.bigissue.com/latest/plugging-the-skills-gap-how-brexit-will-impact-construction-and-health-care/) [migrant workers](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fewer-eu-migrants-increases-skills-shortages-pstf226g8) to fill [key roles](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-government-response-migration-advisory-committee-2018-19-call-evidence-shortage-occupation-list/pages/4/) now.
1.6.1.6. Pro: [The majority](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40015269) of immigration to the UK comes from non-EU countries, which the UK can already control.
1.6.1.6.1. Con: The EU accounts for less than 10% of the world's population, therefore it is inappropriate for it to account for over 40% of UK migrants.
1.6.1.6.1.1. Con: It is only natural for neighboring countries to account for more migrants, especially when it's easier.
1.6.1.6.1.2. Con: This is a very simplistic statistic that doesn't address real world issues and circumstances. It's far less likely for people from African nations to even be able to afford to even come to Britain whilst people from South America are far more likely to migrate to the USA due to geography.
1.6.1.6.1.3. Con: People have a natural tendency to migrate locally, both because they tend to share common cultural and linguistic roots and because of geographical logistics.
1.6.1.6.1.4. Con: There is no global standard governing the appropriateness or otherwise of the nationality mix of any nation's migrant population.
1.6.1.6.1.5. Con: The EU accounts for a much greater share of the world's skilled labour force and has many workers with particular specialised skills, which the UK requires.
1.6.1.6.2. Pro: UK Immigration statistics [categorize](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/04/overseas-students-migrants-universities-brexit) overseas students as migrants, but as many of these students will subsequently leave the UK, this overly inflates migrant numbers.
1.6.1.6.2.1. Con: The [ONS found that](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/whatshappeningwithinternationalstudentmigration/2017-08-24) many people do not simply immigrate for study and leave afterwards; their lives are more complex – some people arrive on a work visa and legitimately change to a study visa and vice versa.
1.6.1.6.3. Pro: Only 2.3m of the UK's current 5.5m foreign born workers are from the EU [\(source\)](https://www.solution-loans.co.uk/blog/why-the-uk-should-remain-in-the-eu/) and in the period 1993 to 2017 only 49% of the increase was due to EU born nationals. Leaving the EU will only partially address any perceived immigration issue.
1.6.1.7. Con: -> See 1.6.1.5.6.
1.6.2. Pro: Consistent [polling](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-31/immigration/introduction.aspx) has shown that a sizable majority believe the UK's immigration levels are too high.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The BSA poll is well respected and has been [running since 1983](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/about/about.aspx).
1.6.2.1.1. Con: How respected a poll is does not take into account that people's perception of immigration is not a solid basis to enact immigration policies.
1.6.2.2. Con: Polling the electorate on their beliefs about the levels of immigration is not a valid method of establishing the correct levels or possible effects of immigration, because individual perceptions can be influenced by the media and scaremongering.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Actually, it's true that British people feel they're hosting [more immigrants than those who they really host](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/oct/29/todays-key-fact-you-are-probably-wrong-about-almost-everything).
1.6.2.2.2. Con: It should be noted however, that the opinions of those that compete for services with migrants are the ones whose lives are most affected by immigration. We should be careful not to neglect the feelings of some people based, for example, on your opinion of the newspaper they read.
1.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Societal fears should not be a factor in policy making. Misperceptions should be mitigated through correct, responsible information to those sectors of the society by the institutions.
1.6.2.3. Con: Public perception and concern over immigration levels have little resemblance to the actual levels of immigration.[LSE Blog - Perceptions and Reality](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/perceptions-and-reality-ten-things-we-should-know-about-attitudes-to-immigration-in-the-uk/)
1.6.2.4. Con: Polls with public results alter perceptions and public opinion by making the majority opinion observable to people who may be influenced when reacting to that same issue.
1.6.2.5. Con: Comparing attitudes before and after the referendum from within the same groups of individuals suggests that both Leavers and Remainers have [softened in their attitudes towards immigration](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/).
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: This has been quantified at 19% softening over 4 years. Inconsistent question wording makes historical comparisons difficult, but good Ipsos MORI data since 2013 suggests that there has been a recent softening of attitudes with just 45% agreeing that there are too many immigrants in 2017 compared to 64% just 4 years earlier. [Figure 2](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/#kp3)
1.6.2.6. Con: Immigration policy should not be based on what some people in the country think the immigration levels should be, but rather what evidence indicates would be best.
1.6.3. Pro: The possibility that Turkey, an EU candidate country that borders war-torn Syria and has a large population, may join the EU is a major [concern](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/world/europe/britain-brexit-turkey-eu.html) to many British Eurosceptics.
1.6.3.1. Con: If Turkey, or any other country, wants to join the EU, they must first [integrate EU policy spanning over 35 areas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35832035). These include human rights policies and freedom of expression. In 10 years Turkey has only managed to align with the EU on two policy areas: science and research. This not only proves that Turkey is not currently anywhere close to joining the EU but also shows that if a country such as Turkey were to join, it would be in a state where its values and interests align with the UK's.
1.6.3.2. Con: Polls in Turkey have shown mixed support for joining the EU and the support has [decreased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#Population) over the past 10 years.
1.6.3.3. Con: The UK have a veto on whether Turkey ever joined the EU.
1.6.3.4. Con: The EU is [unlikely](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-turkey-eu-factbox/factbox-turkeys-collapsing-eu-membership-bid-idUSKCN1BF1TH) to admit Turkey under its current political [situation](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34503388) with or without the UK. Moreover, the UK \(while historically in favor of Turkey's accession\) would [probably](http://www.dw.com/en/turkey-eu-relations-which-countries-are-for-or-against-turkish-accession/a-40381533) be against it if it remains and would have [veto](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/penny-mordaunt-andrew-marr-uk-veto-tory-minister-accused-of-flat-out-lying-over-turkey-joining-the-a7041956.html) power over its accession.
1.6.3.5. Con: The reasons why Eurosceptics object to Turkish EU membership are largely unjustified and based on racial fears. Even if the UK should be allowed to regulate its own immigration policy, these would be illegitimate reasons to exclude Turkey.
1.6.3.5.1. Con: Turkish President Erdogan's [purge on media](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2018/07/erdogan-media-turks-care-180701092502264.html) and the [2017 referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017) granting him further control over government institutions are not compatible with EU democratic standards and anti-corruption efforts.
1.6.4. Con: The EU is not a third party imposing an immigration policy on the UK. As a member of the EU, the UK was involved in the drafting of, and signed up to, the [Maastricht Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty) which introduced the notion of EU citizenship, and the right of any citizen to reside anywhere within the Union. The UK was exercising its right to decide its immigration policy by introducing free movement \(along with its fellow EU-members\).
1.6.5. Con: The EU is [blamed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-says-uncontrolled-immigration-from-eu-is-driving-down-wages-and-putting-pressure-on-a6948346.html) for uncontrolled immigration, yet the EU does have laws that do this that the UK has failed to enact.
1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.6.6. Con: The UK has full control over the flow of non-EU migrants, which accounts for over [80% of the UK's recent immigrant intake](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/february2019#non-eu-net-migration-has-increased-while-eu-net-migration-has-decreased). A failure to control controllable immigration gives a strong indication that EU immigration would not be significantly reduced by Brexit.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.6.
1.6.7. Pro: This would allow the UK to implement a [merit-based](http://www.euronews.com/2017/09/06/watch-live-pm-theresa-may-faces-mps-questions-for-first-time-since-summer-break) immigration policy which, due to strict policing and mandatory quotas, would be impossible under EU regulations.
1.6.7.1. Con: Successive UK Governments have not applied all the measures that are available to police immigration from either without or within the EU.  Under resourced Customs and Immigration departments UK wide are the [problem](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/18/border-force-funding-cut-by-quarter-per-person-arriving-to-uk/), not EU membership as such.
1.6.7.1.1. Pro: Immigration departments in Britain do not have any figures as to how many legal EU and non-EU migrants are currently living in Britain [Link](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/845163/Immigration-figures-wrong-again-Home-Office-scramble-to-get-numbers-right). The Windrush scandal happened because of poor immigration records and Theresa May's "Hostile Environment" policies.
1.6.8. Con: By leaving the EU, the UK has to sign free trade deals with other nations, many of whom may require increased freedom of movement of people, which could potentially offset any decreased immigration from the EU.
1.6.8.1. Pro: India has [stated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-australia-india-tell-uk-relax-immigration-rules-free-trade-deal-eu-visa-restrictions-a7540036.html) that it cannot separate free movement of people from the free flow of goods, services and investments, indicating that any free trade deal will likely require increased immigration from India.
1.6.8.1.1. Con: This statement was from "a senior Indian official", rather than an official red line. It should be seen as a posturing/bargaining point, rather than a certainty.
1.6.8.2. Pro: Australia has [said](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-australia-india-tell-uk-relax-immigration-rules-free-trade-deal-eu-visa-restrictions-a7540036.html) that it wants to liberalise immigration visa policies for Australians wanting to come to the UK.
1.6.8.3. Con: This becomes a matter that can then be controlled by the UK government and renegotiated as necessary, and so is a desirable outcome for those who voted to regain control of the UK's borders.
1.6.8.4. Con: It is highly unlikely any liberalisation of visas will be as expansive as the EU's free movement of people policies.
1.6.8.5. Con: The UK controlling their own immigration policy doesn't necessarily mean it will limit immigration. Perhaps the UK will set such immigration policies as to avoid costs of low immigration or to obtain a free trade agreement with India or Australia.
1.6.8.5.1. Con: Much of the initial impetus of Brexit was around immigration being too high, impacting housing and infrastructure like schools and the NHS. Suggesting that we could have the same or more immigration as a result of Brexit damages the whole "will of the people" argument.
1.6.9. Pro: An open immigration policy with the EU puts the UK's economy at risk.
1.6.9.1. Pro: The UK needs the power to restrict entry into the country in order to maintain its ability to provide for the needs of its citizens in the future, otherwise an unemployment crisis in the rest of the EU could burden the UK with an influx of people in need.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.5.
1.6.9.1.2. Con: According to \[1\], EU migrants contributed on average £2,300 more than the average contribution to UK public finances. UK-born adults contribute on average £70 less than the average and non-EU migrants contribute on average £800 less than the average. On average, EU migrants therefore are less of a burden to the system than UK-born. In fact they counter the burden that UK-born and non-EU migrants pose on the country thus restricting their access to the UK would be detrimental. [\[1\]](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/recent-releases/8747673d-3b26-439b-9693-0e250df6dbba)
1.6.9.2. Con: The level of unemployment of the British state was on a [downwards](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/timeseries/mgsx/lms) trend even when taking in a significant influx of immigrants prior to the initial vote of in or out.
1.6.9.3. Con: Market forces are what control immigration in the EU, making the countries with high economic worth more appealing to the best talent that the EU has to offer. For the UK to compete for these key roles, frictionless employment is essential.
1.6.9.3.1. Con: Once we have free trade deals with countries such as India, which will include free movement of workers, employers will be free to recruit workers from whichever nation can supply them the cheapest, whereas if the UK remains in the EU, it will be caught by [new EU regulations](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/eu-brexit-uk-labour-laws-migrant-workers-a8375836.html) which prevent immigrant labour from undercutting the local workforce.
1.6.9.4. Con: The free movement of people between the UK and the rest of the EU is actually economically beneficial for the UK.
1.6.9.4.1. Pro: The USA is commonly called the most economically powerful country in the world, and has the [highest number of migrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population) \(46 million\).
1.6.9.4.1.1. Con: Correlation does not necessarily mean causation - immigration might not be a factor causing success, but a reaction to success.
1.6.9.4.1.1.1. Pro: Immigrants naturally flock away from less successful countries towards more successful countries.
1.6.9.4.1.2. Pro: A survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the view that high-skilled immigration makes the average American better off. A survey of the same economists also shows strong support behind the notion that low-skilled [immigration makes the average American better off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Economic).
1.6.9.4.1.2.1. Con: The predictions of "economists" in general are not credible. Specific economists with demonstrable track records of predictive success may be more credible.
1.6.9.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The predictions and views of surveyed economists are so often [misleading or plain wrong.](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/02/economic-forecasting-flawed-science-data)
1.6.9.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Economics is not a science](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/10390981/Time-to-stop-this-pretence-economics-is-not-science.html) or -at least- economists are not scientists.
1.6.9.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: Economists have been found guilty of [groupthink, guided by political ends and using error-prone gravity modelling](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/jan/08/economic-forecasts-hardwired-get-things-wrong).
1.6.9.4.1.3. Pro: America, the promised land, [was built](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigrants-make-america-great-because-immigrants-made_us_5928a40ce4b08861ed0cc96d) on the backs of immigrants. It's melting pot of migrants is a huge part of it's conception, history, and success.
1.6.9.4.1.3.1. Pro: Because the United States is a settler colonial society, the vast majority of Americans, with the exception of Native Americans, [can trace their ancestry to immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States) from other nations.
1.6.9.4.1.4. Pro: The other countries with next highest immigration levels are also all economically strong countries:  Germany \(12m\), Russia \(11m\), Saudi Arabia \(10m\), UK \(8m\).
1.6.9.4.1.4.1. Con: The economies of Russia and Saudi Arabia are massively reliant on oil and natural gas, and so in addition to this being something unattributable to migration, the lack of diversification makes the economies prone to economic shock and underlying strength may be illusory.
1.6.9.4.1.4.2. Pro: Germany, UK, and Russia are in the [top 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) economies in Europe, by nominal and PPP GDP.
1.6.9.4.1.4.2.1. Con: Russia is [46th](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) out of 50 European countries by measure of GDP growth rate, and [31st](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) out of 50 by GDP per capita.
1.6.9.4.1.4.3. Pro: The Saudi economy is the [largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Saudi_Arabia) in the Arab world.
1.6.9.4.1.5. Con: The USA does not have free movement of people with the EU, indicating free movement with  the EU is in no way a prerequisite for a country to be economically  powerful.
1.6.9.4.2. Con: The free movement of people may have been economically beneficial for the UK in the past, however the law of diminishing returns suggests that the economic benefits are being increasingly eroded by the associated societal costs, as negative externalities caused by population pressures mount. This is what has happened in the UK.
1.6.9.4.2.1. Pro: Immigration has been the [largest driver](https://fullfact.org/health/increasing-population-households/) of the increasing population, according to the Office for National Statistics.
1.6.9.4.2.1.1. Con: Given that the average birthrate in the UK is [1.7 children per](https://www.onaverage.co.uk/other-averages/average-number-of-children) couple, the UK needs immigration to reach a stable population replacement rate.
1.6.9.4.2.2. Pro: In 2010, a cross-party group including MPs, poverty experts, economic historians, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury issued a [“Declaration on Population”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/09/is-britain-full-home-truths-about-population-panic). It warned that a UK population of 70 million – which will arrive about 2030, based on current trends – “would be seriously damaging to the future harmony of our society.”
1.6.9.4.2.3. Con: The [UK's ageing population](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-parliament-2015/social-change/ageing-population/) makes the free movement of people advantageous to the long-term strategic requirements of the UK population by providing working age migrants to do the necessary jobs, care for the elderly and contribute to public service funding.
1.6.9.4.2.3.1. Pro: [EU migrants](http://bruegel.org/2016/06/what-is-the-age-profile-of-uk-immigrants/) are younger and more likely to be in work compared to the average member of the population, and so pay more tax and rely on state services less.
1.6.9.4.2.4. Con: The "negative externalities", such as housing and transport issues, are planning failures. The failure of government to properly allocate taxes to manage infrastructure investment requirements has little to do with immigration.
1.6.9.4.3. Con: Whether or not it is beneficial in an economic sense does not affect whether or not the UK should have the right to control it.
1.6.9.4.4. Pro: Migrants make a positive net contribution to the economy.
1.6.9.4.4.1. Pro: Data analysis of 30 years of data from 15 countries in Western Europe shows that [migrants positively affect the economy within a year of arrival](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaaq0883), continuing to have significant impact for 2+ years.
1.6.9.4.4.2. Pro: In America, immigrants are [net fiscal contributors](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550) on the federal level.
1.6.9.4.4.3. Pro: Researchers generally agree that immigrants from the European Economic Area \(EEA\) and recent immigrants are, as groups, [more likely to have a positive net fiscal impact](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/).
1.6.9.4.4.3.1. Pro: A [2014 UCL study](http://www.cream-migration.org/files/FiscalEJ.pdf) estimated that during the years 1995-2011 the total fiscal impact of EEA migrants in the UK was about +£0.3 billion per year, but the total fiscal impact of non-EEA migrants for this period was estimated at -£6.9 billion per year. The UK-born population impact was -£34.8 billion per year.
1.6.9.4.4.4. Con: A [report](https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Paying%20Their%20Way_1352.pdf?noredirect=1) from the Institute for Public Policy Research \(IPPR\) in 2005 found that expenditure attributed to immigrants grew by more than the revenue from them, resulting in a negative impact of -£0.4 billion in 2003-4.
1.6.9.4.4.4.1. Con: During this time period the report found that the UK born population also had a negative fiscal impact, and their [impact was higher](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/) than the immigrant impact.
1.6.9.4.4.5. Con: [MigrationWatch UK studies](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/7) show that depending on how you account for dependent children or the elderly, migrants give a negative net contribution.
1.6.9.4.4.5.1. Pro: If costs from children born to one immigrant and one UK-born parent are [shared between both categories](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/), MigrationWatch estimates show that the net fiscal impact of immigrants was negative \(-£1 billion for 1999-2000 and -£5 billion for 2003-2004\).
1.6.9.4.4.5.1.1. Con: These UK born children should count as fully UK born, not half immigrant, because they are UK citizens.
1.6.9.4.4.5.1.2. Pro: Alternative estimates allocating all children of mixed couples to the immigrant group show the fiscal cost of migrants to be [much higher](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/) \(around -£3.8 billion in 1999-2000\).
1.6.9.4.4.5.2. Pro: A Migration Watch UK [paper](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/381) looking at the 2014/15 period found that if you look at the Working Age population only, the UK-born population was the only group that \(out of EEA, Non-EEA, UK Born\) [did make a positive fiscal contribution](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/).
1.6.9.4.4.5.2.1. Con: It is fairer to look at the whole age range than a narrow one, as increases in dependents/the elderly has a significant effect, and all effects of migration should be considered.
1.6.9.4.4.5.3. Con: Migration Watch is an [advocacy group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MigrationWatch_UK) that argues for increased restrictions on immigration to the United Kingdom. It is likely to select and report data in a biased fashion.
1.6.9.4.4.6. Pro: HMRC released a [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tax-contribution-of-recently-arrived-eea-nationals-for-2013-to-2014) in May 2016, which said that recently arrived EEA nationals –those who arrived within the previous 4 years – received £0.56 billion in tax credits and Child Benefit in the 2013/14 fiscal year but paid £3.11 billion in income taxes and national insurance contributions.
1.6.9.4.4.6.1. Con: This report ignored taxes like VAT and Council Tax, benefits like Housing Benefit and JSA, and use of a range of public services, and so is not a good indicator of financial cost/benefit.
1.6.9.4.4.7. Pro: In 2013 the Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\) predicted that in the long term \(50 years\) [higher net immigration would reduce pressure on government debt](http://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/2013-FSR_OBR_web.pdf).
1.6.9.4.4.8. Pro: The [OECD found that](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2013_migr_outlook-2013-en) migration in the UK contributed +0.46% of GDP.
1.6.9.4.4.8.1. Pro: The UK benefits more than average from migration, receiving +0.11% higher GDP due to migration than the average \(+0.35% of GDP\).
1.6.9.4.4.9. Con: -> See 1.6.1.5.6.1.2.
1.6.9.4.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.5.6.1.2.1.2.
1.6.9.4.4.11. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.5.6.1.3.
1.6.9.4.5. Pro: Engineered austerity, not immigration, is [behind](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-scathing-report-of-britains-treatment-of-the-poor) a lack of resources.
1.6.9.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.4.4.
1.6.9.4.6. Pro: Our ageing population will not be able to support itself on the tax revenue of the next generation, without attracting an immigrant population of working-age people.
1.6.9.4.7. Pro: The end of the free movement of people will reduce the supply of labour, damaging the British economy.
1.6.9.4.7.1. Pro: Skilled foreign workers actually [grow](http://uk.businessinsider.com/immigrants-create-jobs-for-local-workers-2015-6) British businesses, making them more profitable and leading to further job creation.
1.6.9.4.7.2. Pro: Leaving the EU means we could lose over [4,500 NHS nurses](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-brexit-crisis-could-see-12925831), among many other skilled workers that come from the EU.
1.6.9.4.7.2.1. Con: The expected reduction in the numbers of NHS staff required from the rest of the EU will ensure that the UK government will be forced to reverse decades of decline in the numbers of NHS staff trained within the UK. This will in the long term make the NHS more self-sufficient in staffing, will improve salaries for NHS staff and will improve employment in the country overall.
1.6.9.4.7.2.1.1. Con: It is untrue that they will be forced to spend more money, when there is a constraint on resources owing to Brexit. It seems more likely that they'll force the NHS to adjust to the lack of money.
1.6.9.4.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.4.4.
1.6.9.4.7.4. Con: The UK is one of the [least mechanised](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/08/britains-economy-is-not-suffering-as-much-as-the-doom-mongers-insist/) country in the developed world due to the low cost of immigrant labour. This depresses wages and harms manufacturing output. Lack of immigrant labour would lead to increased mechanisation and the funding of training for employees who would in turn earn more money - thus helping with the gap in wages and cost of living.
1.6.9.4.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.4.2.3.1.
1.6.9.4.7.6. Pro: UK unemployment is at an [all time low](http://uk.businessinsider.com/uk-unemployment-rate-productivity-wages-2017-2018-1), meaning the country is almost at [full employment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp), and therefore the economy will suffer if the labour pool is reduced.
1.6.9.4.7.7. Pro: In low-skilled sectors \(e.g. hospitality, food processing and construction\) employers have difficulty finding British employees and rely on predominantly Eastern European migrant labour \([Rolfe, p.51](https://www.niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Free%20movement%20-%20Final%20report.pdf)\).
1.6.9.4.7.8. Con: Reducing immigration is a political choice that is not necessitated by a hard Brexit.
1.6.9.4.7.8.1. Pro: The point of Brexit is that it will be up to the people, as represented through their MPs, who will decide what sort of immigration system they want; together with the freedom to change it whenever they want into the future.
1.6.9.4.7.8.1.1. Con: The UK Government has chosen to implement its own interpretation of Brexit. There has been no consultation with the British electorate to debate what kind of immigration system the public wants or what socio-economic costs there would be for doing so.
1.6.9.4.7.8.1.1.1. Con: The Government sought a mandate from the electorate based on its manifesto at the last general election, and received it.
1.6.9.4.7.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Theresa May insisted that a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for confidence in her delivering Brexit. She lost numerous seats in the last General Election.
1.6.9.4.7.8.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.9.4.7.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.
1.6.9.4.7.8.4. Con: Both sides chose to focus on values, not the details of Britain's EU membership. Due to the Leave campaign's focus on immigration policy, [immigration became the defining issue of the referendum](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/immigration-now-top-issue-voters-eu-referendum). This means many people likely made their decision based on the Leave campaign's promises to cut immigration, rather than considering the specifics of EU policy and what leaving actually entailed.
1.6.9.4.7.8.4.1. Con: [Ashcroft's poll](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/) taken on referendum polling day suggests the single most popular reason for the leave vote was the issue of sovereignty \(49%\). Since [polls taken on election day yield a more representative sample](https://www.ft.com/content/0e38ae9e-4a16-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43), it is more likely that sovereignty was the defining issue.
1.6.9.4.7.8.4.1.1. Con: [Parliamentary sovereignty](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/sovereignty/) is a principle of the UK constitution. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK, which can create or end any law. Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution. Yet the hard brexiteers want to deprive Parliament of a [meaningful vote](https://amp.businessinsider.com/explained-dominic-grieve-meaningful-vote-brexit-amendment-2018-6), thus subverting their sovereignty.
1.6.9.4.7.8.4.1.2. Con: It is hard to separate votes for immigration and votes for sovereignty. Leave politicians insisted that taking back our Sovereignty was a means of restricting immigration by allowing us to "control our borders".
1.6.9.4.7.8.4.2. Con: Regardless of the defining issue for leave or remain voters \(for whom it was[the risk of leaving to economy, jobs etc.](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/)\), it does not logically follow that EU policy and what leaving actually entailed were not given full consideration by those voters.
1.6.9.4.7.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.5.
1.6.9.4.7.9. Con: Although it is generally small, there is a specific downward effect on the [wages of unskilled native workers](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2015/the-impact-of-immigration-on-occupational-wages-evidence-from-britain). As they are a vulnerable group, their economic welfare ought to be prioritised.
1.6.9.4.7.9.1. Con: Maybe, instead of paralysing the British economy with a Hard Brexit, the government should invest in high-skills education for those native workers who aren't skilled.
1.6.9.4.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.5.6.1.2.
1.6.9.4.7.9.3. Con: Brexit is [unlikely to help](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-wages-theresa-may-gdp-deal-eu-latest-analysis-a8655746.html) the most economically disadvantaged.
1.6.9.4.7.9.4. Con: The economic welfare of the poorest is better served by the increase in tax income that immigration [provides](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-workers-uk-tax-treasury-brexit-migrants-british-citizens-a8542506.html) overall than by trying to protect them from the small reduction in wages that immigration sometimes causes.
1.6.9.4.7.9.5. Con: -> See 1.6.1.5.6.1.4.
1.6.9.4.8. Con: -> See 1.6.9.4.7.8.
1.6.10. Con: The Brexit campaign resulted in a significant increase of expressions of xenophobia and racism, which may make it harder for the UK to attract foreign workers.
1.6.10.1. Pro: The government has a policy of creating a [hostile environment](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmhaff/421/42106.htm) for illegal immigrants which will be extended to include [EU citizens](https://www.the3million.org.uk/hostile-environment).
1.6.10.1.1. Con: EU citizens who choose to break our laws and come here illegally should find a hostile environment.
1.6.10.2. Con: Making it more difficult to attract foreign skilled workers will encourage the public and private sectors to invest more in training UK residents.
1.6.10.3. Con: An exodus of skilled workers from foreign countries can lead to a brain drain in those countries, negatively affecting their development.
1.6.10.4. Pro: A [UN special report](https://ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23074&LangID=E) said that Brexit has contributed to an environment of increased racial discrimination and intolerance, and has made [racial and ethnic minorities more vulnerable](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/uk-has-seen-brexit-related-growth-in-racism-says-un-representative) to racial discrimination and intolerance.
1.6.10.5. Pro: Police figures obtained through Freedom of Information \(FOI\) requests show [incidents surged by 23 per cent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/racist-hate-crimes-surge-to-record-high-after-brexit-vote-new-figures-reveal-a7829551.html) – from 40,741 to 49,921 – in the 11 months after the EU referendum, compared with the same period the previous year. This is the highest spike in religious and racial hate crimes ever recorded.
1.6.10.6. Pro: The UK's Home Office confirmed victims’ reports of a [dramatic increase in incidents](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hate-crimes-eu-referendum-spike-brexit-terror-attacks-police-home-office-europeans-xenophobia-a8004716.html) motivated by attackers’ hostility towards their race, nationality, religion or other factors.
1.6.10.6.1. Con: A home office spokesperson said that the increase was thought to also be due to ongoing [improvements in crime recording](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/hate-crimes-eu-referendum-spike-brexit-terror-attacks-police-home-office-europeans-xenophobia-a8004716.html) by the police.
1.6.10.7. Con: This is a temporary effect, not a long lasting change in UK racism.
1.6.10.7.1. Pro: The increase was due to the widespread public debate. Debate will significantly lessen once we leave \(or remain\), and therefore tension within the British public will lessen.
1.6.10.7.2. Con: There has been a [large](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/revealed-antimuslim-hate-crimes-in-london-soared-by-40-in-a-year-a3775751.html) [rise](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/20/record-number-anti-muslim-attacks-reported-uk-2017) in hate crimes against muslims \(26% rise in 2017\) and people from other non-EU backgrounds. After brexit these groups are not going to decrease in size \(if anything we will see a rise in commonwealth migrants\) even though the expectation among brexiteers is that migration will fall. This disillusionment quite possibly will lead to further increases in bigotry and racism
1.6.10.8. Con: -> See 1.6.2.5.
1.6.10.9. Pro: Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Service have warned of a “[real possibility](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/19/brexit-will-trigger-rise-in-hate-crimes-warns-police-watchdog)” that Britain’s exit from the European Union next year will trigger a spike in hate crimes.
1.7. Pro: A hard Brexit will negatively affect the National Health Service.
1.7.1. Con: [£20 billion has been pledged to NHS](http://www.itv.com/news/2018-06-16/nhs-to-receive-20bn-boost-by-2024-partly-funded-by-brexit-dividend-says-may/) by 2024, funded by money saved from the EU membership.
1.7.1.1. Con: FullFact suggest that [none of the £20 billion Brexit dividend will actually come from Brexit savings](https://fullfact.org/europe/does-brexit-dividend-exist/).
1.7.1.2. Pro: The Brexit dividend will pay the [equivalent of £384 million a week](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/975322/brexit-news-nhs-funding-600-million-week-victory-leave-european-union), more than the [£350 million promised by Vote Leave](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/brexit-latest-nhs-england-350-million-per-week-pledge-eu-simon-stevens-brussels-a8043191.html).
1.7.1.2.1. Con: The EU membership cost to Britain is £13.1bn a year, or [approximately](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) £251m a week. £4.5bn of that fee covers money paid back to Britain for farming subsidies, science research, regeneration grants, etc. Researchers suggest that the loss of trade through a No-Deal Brexit will [cost far more](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-no-trade-deal-with-eu-cost-58-billion-annually-customs-union-tariffs-a8251581.html) than the EU membership fee itself, a total of £58bn a year.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: The figures of £350/384 million are intentionally misleading as they do not include the UK's rebate, [this amount is never sent to the EU](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/), so should not be considered for any dividend.
1.7.1.3. Con: A likely period of economic harm after Brexit may be enough to do permanent damage to the already struggling NHS as well as other public services as Government tax revenues would be hit.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: A hard Brexit will significantly damage the UK economy.
1.7.1.3.1.1. Pro: Britain may have to pay a Brexit divorce bill.
1.7.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The UK's [Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\) suggests](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/689581/CCS207_CCS0318157642-1_OBR_EFO_March_2018_Accessible.pdf#page=23) that Britian will be [paying the divorce bill until 2064](https://fullfact.org/europe/brexit-divorce-bill-2064/), with the majority paid by 2021, and the total net estimate at £37.1 billion. \(March 2018\)
1.7.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It's the same with a bad internet provider. Sometimes it is better to pay the contract cancellation fee than to use a bad service.
1.7.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: In the budget for financial year 2016–17, [proposed total government spending was £772 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending_in_the_United_Kingdom). This should be our perspective. £37.1 Billion sounds like a lot of money, but in 3 years time, it's not that much.
1.7.1.3.1.1.2. Con: In the event of a no deal brexit, there will be [no divorce bill](http://uk.businessinsider.com/government-not-obliged-to-pay-52-billion-brexit-divorce-bill-2017-3) for the UK to pay, as the [agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-report-on-progress-during-phase-1-of-negotiations-under-article-50-teu-on-the-uks-orderly-withdrawal-from-the-eu&ved=2ahUKEwiDt-Wv8-rbAhUrBsAKHcamDHAQFjAFegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw2lySUz0sIGRclxf59BZreS) reached thus far has been "under the caveat that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed."
1.7.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: In December 2017, the British prime minister [put forward £39 billion](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-divorce-bill-financial-settlement-39-billion-theresa-may-juncker-agreement-northern-ireland-a8099076.html), though recent [auditors say](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-divorce-bill-brexit-theresa-may-estimate-eu-exchange-rate-pac-a8312776.html) "relatively small changes” to government assumptions – on economic performance, ongoing payments into EU schemes or the exchange rate – would throw out the calculation.
1.7.1.3.1.1.4. Con: The [British prime minister said](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-11/debates/965E3010-41F6-4353-A2CC-2F5A6C31495F/BrexitNegotiations) "We will continue to pay our net contributions under the current EU budget plan" but added that that was "conditional upon a number of principles we have negotiated over how we will ultimately arrive at a fair valuation of these commitments" \(December 2017\).
1.7.1.3.1.1.5. Pro: Article 70 of the [Vienna Treaty](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201155/volume-1155-i-18232-english.pdf) says a party leaving a treaty has an obligation to existing agreements made before leaving.
1.7.1.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: The [Vienna Treaty text says](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12511.htm)  "termination of a treaty" "does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.”
1.7.1.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: If the Vienna Treaty Applies, Brexit is bound by international treaty to pay it's Divorce Bill.
1.7.1.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: A House of Lords report decided "the meaning of Article 50 TEU, should, as a matter of EU law, be determined in the light of rules laid down in the Vienna Convention"
- ["Brexit and the EU budget" March 2017](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12511.htm).
1.7.1.3.1.1.5.3. Con: A House of Lords report "concludes that Article 50 TEU is 'lex specialis', or an exception, expressly mentioned in the first part of Article 70 VCLT. In other words, because the TEU contains a specific provision on withdrawal, Article 70 is irrelevant to the UK’s financial obligations arising out of its EU membership." 
- ["Brexit and the EU budget" March 2017](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/125/12507.htm#_idTextAnchor040).
1.7.1.3.1.1.5.3.1. Con: [Independent legal analysis has suggested](https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-brexit-bill-and-the-law-of-treaties/) this is incorrect. Article 50 TEU only specifies a specific procedure \(the timeline and notification requirements\), and does not explicitly specify anything about existing obligations, and so does nothing to overrule the specified existing obligations under Article 70 VCLT.
1.7.1.3.1.1.5.4. Con: Those agreements were made with two major caveats. Firstly, the possibility of leaving the EU with a two year notice period. Second, the expectation of continuing benefits. Art 70 of the Vienna Treaty is therefore \(arguably\) satisfied without any payment after March 2019 in the event of no deal.
1.7.1.3.1.1.6. Con: If there is no agreement in place at the point of leaving there would be no legal [obligation](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39294904) for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement, saving them a large amount of money.
1.7.1.3.1.1.6.1. Pro: The UK can leave the EU without a deal and negotiations for a new arrangement can continue. As a deal will last for many years, if not forever, it is critical to obtain a fair deal and not enter into a bad deal .
1.7.1.3.1.1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.1.1.2.
1.7.1.3.1.1.6.3. Con: A part of the financial settlement is finalising EU investment in UK based projects. If the settlement was abandoned, then these projects would have to be finished or, even worse, restarted at the UK taxpayers expense.
1.7.1.3.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: The European Structural and Investment Fund has[€14.2bn of unspent planned UK expenditure with a further €7.3bn of unplanned expenditure to be spent.](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7847/CBP-7847.pdf)
1.7.1.3.1.1.6.4. Con: Not paying for agreed commitments would destroy goodwill and trust towards the UK, which will diminish our ability to negotiate any beneficial new trade deals, whether with the EU or others.
1.7.1.3.1.1.6.4.1. Con: If the UK were to leave without a deal it would leave a hole in the EU budget. This would be a better incentive for a trade deal though the amount might be renegotiated depending on the trade deal on offer.
1.7.1.3.1.2. Pro: Trade deals take [time](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/07/how-long-do-trade-deals-take-after-brexit/) to negotiate. So for a period of some years the UK will not have negotiated trade deals which will impact the economy. At which point with the UK desperate for trade deals in the beginning to limit the impact of WTO tariffs, it will be likely the UK will be negotiating from a position of weakness and will negotiate one sided deals detrimental to the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: In the event of a hard Brexit, Britain will overnight be excluded from EU arrangements with “third countries”, or non-EU countries, entering the equivalent of a legal void in key parts of its external commercial relations. This exclusion will mean that the UK will have to [renegotiate](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) 759 treaties.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The UK will still be able to trade under WTO rules with countries whilst setting up \(hopefully more beneficial\) trade agreements with various nations.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The WTO has [stated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/no-deal-brexit-uk-trading-wto-under-wto-rules-not-realistic-roberto-azevedo-a8505946.html) that it is not realistic to start trading on WTO terms immediately after Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Britain can negotiate its relationship with the EU [whilst still being a member](https://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/resource/possible-united-kingdom-negotiate-trade-agreement-eu-ftas-third-countries-new-legal-status-within-wto-part-eu/).
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Britain could negotiate their status, if they had the slightest clue of what their negotiating stance should be. Sadly they do not.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: 295 of these treaties are [trade treaties](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e), leaving in limbo countless businesses who will not know what rules govern trading relations between the UK and other countries.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: Each agreement has to be reviewed, the country approached, the decision makers found, meetings arranged, trips made, negotiations started and completed. This will take up considerable time and resources of the British government, where some treaties may not be negotiated in time for Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Many countries want to know the outcome of EU-UK talks [before](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) making their own commitments to the UK, ensuring that their won't in fact be treaties signed with some non-EU nations by the time a hard Brexit occurs.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.4. Pro: Multi-lateral agreements based on consensus also need to be renegotiated, where Britain must [re-approach](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) 132 separate parties.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.5. Con: The UK is trying to [secure](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) transition agreements that will minimise disruption to trade after Brexit, allowing breathing room for old deals to be renegotiated and new ones to be made.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: The UK has secured a [one year transitional period](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-43456502)  \(Brexit day to 31 December 2020\).
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: The EU27 may extend the transition period and [require Britain to refrain](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-trade-deals-liam-fox-two-years-veto-michel-barnier-negotiating-guidelines-a8160996.html) from implementing any independent trade deals for two years after Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.2.1.5.2. Con: There will not be any [automatic](https://euobserver.com/uk-referendum/140571) roll-over of EU trade deals for the UK during the post-Brexit transition period, unless the EU negotiates them individually with non-EU states. It is unlikely the EU will taken on this burden, or be able to complete the negotiations for all the treaties in the limited time remaining.
1.7.1.3.1.3. Pro: A Brexit reversal would have a beneficial impact on the UK's economy. This is because it would boost investor [certainty](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/17/reversing-brexit-second-referendum-would-have-positive-impact/) in the UK market.
1.7.1.3.1.4. Pro: A recent government analysis indicates that the UK economy will contract by [as much as 9%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/economy-could-shrink-by-9-percent-under-no-deal-brexit-government-says) after no-deal Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.5. Con: The exceptionally strong performance of the UK economy since the Brexit vote indicates that a hard Brexit will significantly benefit the UK economy.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1. Con: Since the announcement of Brexit the value of the pound has [dropped](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/gbp/GBP-to-EUR#charts).
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: The weaker pound will make British exports more competitive.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: However, with hard Brexit there will be a lack of involvement in the free market. This would mean decreased exports to EU countries due to less benefits and thus increased costs.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply. Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, which would negatively affect many British companies who rely on this trade.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: British farmers would face [30-40](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-collapse-negotiations-eu-uk-theresa-may-david-davis-no-deal-wto-a7955471.html) per cent charges for exporting to the EU. This would be a huge blow to agriculture in Britain.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Part of the reason UK farmers are so reliant on EU markets is because the [protectionist](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/protectionism-tariffs-us-european-union-913499) [nature](https://brexitcentral.com/remainer-lord-hannay-wrong-eu-tariffs-african-imports/) of the [EU bloc](https://iea.org.uk/the-eus-thousands-of-senseless-tariffs-punish-the-poor/) means that reciprocal tariffs or strict quotas are in place with many other countries.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Mark Manger and Atom Vayalinkal \(of the London School of Economics\), who have compared tariff data for Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, the UK and the US, [reach a different conclusion](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/10/24/the-eu-isnt-protectionist-its-one-of-the-most-open-economies-in-the-world/). On manufactured goods the EU has the second-lowest tariffs after Japan. On agricultural products Japan has the highest tariffs, followed by the US.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Looking at average tariffs as Manger and Vayalinkal have done can disguise the true picture, as tariffs are only one of the ways in which protectionist entities like the EU and US restrict trade, and specific tariffs still cause harm, as explained by [Rolf Langhammer](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/protectionism-tariffs-us-european-union-913499) and [Kevin Dowd](https://iea.org.uk/the-eus-thousands-of-senseless-tariffs-punish-the-poor/).
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The European Union is one of the most open economies in the world and is committed to free trade.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has unveiled a blueprint for a [free-trade deal with the U.S](http://fortune.com/2019/02/22/europe-trade-deal-usa/?#), saying that “While we are talking, we should not impose any tariffs on each other”.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The average applied tariff for goods imported into the EU is very low. More than [70% of imports enter the EU at zero or reduced tariffs](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/index_en.htm).
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The EU has [over 35 free trade agreements with 62 partner countries](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2018/october/tradoc_157468.pdf), and the pace of new FTAs in increasing.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Entering into WTO would provide us with the same access to Europe as other non-European countries and any negotiations with regards specific tariffs would be scheduled later as we'd continue on current values. Going WTO is a scaremonger story and the reality is we import more than too Europe, WTO negotiations would be in our favour.[ukandeu.ac.uk](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/no-deal-the-wto-option/)
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Continued EU membership [guarantees](http://foodresearch.org.uk/publications/feeding-britain-food-security-after-brexit/) the long term security of food.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: UK trades internationally under EU WTO schedules and quotas, a Hard-Brexit will require immediate implementation of a [UK WTO Schedule and Quota](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news18_e/mark_24jul18_e.htm). This does not exist and could take a long time to agree.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.5. Con: In the absence of any agreement with the EU, imports from the EU will raise £12.9bn for the UK Treasury in duties, whilst UK exporters will face £5.2bn in total in tariffs on their exports to the EU. [blogs.lse.ac.uk](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/01/27/post-brexit-trade-can-thrive-under-wto-rules/)
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Car industry analysis suggests that [EU tariffs on cars](https://www.smmt.co.uk/industry-topics/brexit/) alone could add £1.8 billion to the cost of exporting UK cars to the EU, decreasing UK competitiveness in the European market.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: The UK [manufactures enough](https://www.smmt.co.uk/industry-topics/brexit/key-exports-data/) cars domestically that British citizens will not have a problem.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Only a [tiny fraction](https://www.theaa.com/car-buying/cars-made-in-britain) of these are made by British-owned companies. The bulk are made by companies which are [pulling out because of Brexit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/business/brexit-honda.html).
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Cars are [bad](https://www.kialo.com/should-private-cars-be-forbidden-in-large-cities-9351) anyway. Good riddance.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Cars manufactured in the UK by EU companies will suffer from tariffs and delays on parts, which could make it more expensive and logistically more difficult than to manufacture the cars on the continent and then take just a single tariff and delay to sell to the UK. This could result in the shutdown of plants in the UK owned by EU companies and a consequential loss in jobs.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Reciprocal tariffs imposed on goods the EU sends to the UK would protect some British industries, contributing to economic growth.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.7.1. Con: The UK is a net importer with the EU. [Imports exceeded exports by £7.6 billion](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/OverseasTradeStatistics/Pages/EU_and_Non-EU_Data.aspx) in April 2018.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.8. Con: As Britain comprises [16%](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20170410-1) of EU GDP, reciprocal tariffs would hurt EU businesses as well, incentivising the agreement of sector-specific trade deals.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.9. Pro: 75% of British fish is exported. Leaving the EU would put Britain in a position similar to Norway, which is subject to tariffs on exported fish, and has described this as a '[serious obstacle to trade](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-4043758/EU-trade-key-success-UK-fish-industry-75-home-caught-fish-exported-majority-fish-eaten-Britons-imported.html)'.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.9.1. Con: Such a high level of exported fish indicates how in demand British fish is in the EU. The imposition of tariffs will hurt EU consumers first and foremost.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.9.1.1. Con: Trade is not zero-sum: it is possible for tariffs to hurt both the exporter and the importer, and therefore both the UK and the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: This would illustrate that the EU as a political organisation is willing to hurt its own citizens in order to protect its own narrow interests, which is a good argument in itself for the UK leaving such a spiteful club.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.7.1.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.3. Con: Currency depreciation also makes UK produced products [more expensive](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/why-pound-sterling-collapse-not-good-uk-economy-robert-skidelsky) as many of them are deeply integrated in foreign supply chains and need foreign imported inputs to produce. When sterling depreciates and import prices rise, the effect on export prices renders them less competitive.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.2. Pro: Should a hard brexit actually pass, several experts [predict](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/16/brexit-dont-buy-british-pound-sterling-investment-experts-say.html) the pound may come under further pressure.
1.7.1.3.1.5.1.3. Pro: Increased import prices that come with currency depreciation [harm](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-inflation-latest-updates-news-pound-sterling-brexit-vote-prices-city-london-a7941921.html) the British consumer as the UK economy [relies on imports](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-trade-deficit-latest-record-high-pound-sterling-slump-exports-goods-imports-brexit-a7992051.html).
1.7.1.3.1.5.2. Pro: UK wage growth is at the [fastest level since 2008](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/22/uk-pay-growth-employment-weekly-earnings), far outstripping inflation, confounding the pre-referendum pessimistic forecasts.
1.7.1.3.1.5.3. Pro: The UK employment rate has hit a [record high of 75.8%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46958560), confounding the pre-referendum pessimistic forecasts.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4. Pro: The [UK economy grew at 1.3%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihyr/pn2) in 2018 \(comparing Q4 2018 to Q4 2017\), faster than that of Germany [\(0.6%\)](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth) or France [\(0.9%\)](https://tradingeconomics.com/france/gdp-growth), confounding the pre-referendum pessimistic forecasts.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1. Con: Brexit hasn't happened yet.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1.1. Con: Brexit is a process. Economic predictions were for catastrophe as soon as a pro-Brexit vote happened. These were clearly [not just wrong](https://fullfact.org/economy/brexit-and-economic-apocalypse/), but in many cases, e.g. employment and public finances, the opposite of what has happened.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Let's not conflate the process of forming any leaving deal with the implementation itself which is not a process.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1.2. Con: Businesses cite uncertainty as the biggest economic inhibitor. The post-referendum period has seen the most uncertainty from a policy perspective over a hard brexit. The fact that the economy is doing so well despite this uncertainty indicates a hard brexit holds nothing to fear.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: Not all [commentators](https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/economics-policy/insights/uk-economic-outlook.html) are convinced the economy is doing as well as claimed.
1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [CBI](http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/cbi-sets-out-business-impact-of-a-no-deal-brexit-in-every-region-and-nation-across-the-uk/) doesn't want no deal.
1.7.1.3.1.5.5. Pro: The UK unemployment is [below 4% for the first time since 1975](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47622415), 3 years after the vote to leave the EU, confounding the pre-referendum pessimistic forecasts.
1.7.1.3.1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.4.1.
1.7.1.3.1.5.7. Pro: The value of UK exports has [increased markedly by over 20%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/exports) in just 2.5 years since the Brexit vote, whereas the value of exports was flat for the preceding four years.
1.7.1.3.1.5.8. Pro: UK government 10 year borrowing costs are at [historically low rates](https://datahub.io/core/bond-yields-uk-10y), currently just 1.01% and down 0.3 points on a year ago, indicating that the market is extremely confident in UK government finances and is unconcerned by any risk associated with a hard Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.5.8.1. Con: Some [commentators](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/dec/20/markets-ftse-100-fed-rate-hike-donald-trump-bank-of-england-business-live?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard) think that low interest rates reflect the Bank of England's concerns regarding the economy.
1.7.1.3.1.5.8.2. Con: The [last time](https://www.ft.com/content/ef568030-a7a8-11e4-be63-00144feab7de) the UK’s 10-year gilt yield fell to a historic low was in the midst of the eurozone debt crisis in 2012.
1.7.1.3.1.5.9. Con: Not [everyone](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/cf51e840-7147-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9) agrees that the UK's economic performance has been exceptional.
1.7.1.3.1.5.10. Con: Economic effects are not always immediate. The likely loss of single market and passporting rights has caused investment in the UK economy to drop by around [£300B](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/jaw-dropping-300-billion-negative-swing-in-foreign-investment-flows-since-brexit/29/04/) a year already, even before leaving the EU. This will not be felt immediately, but will have harmful long term consequences on productivity and growth.
1.7.1.3.1.5.11. Con: There is now a [long and expanding list](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-companies-leaving-uk-list-job-cuts-eu-no-deal-customs-union-a8792296.html) of major employers leaving the UK due to brexit. These include, but are not limited to: Barclays, Dyson, Honda, HSBC, Lloyds of London, Moneygram, P&O, Nissan, Sony, Panasonic, Airbus, JPMorgan, Toyota. To claim this will lead to economic benefits is not credible.
1.7.1.3.1.5.12. Con: [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/brexit-uk-financial-services-sector-moves-1-trillion-in-assets-to-eu.html) of financial assets are leaving Britain because of Brexit. This will significantly harm the Exchequer's ability to tax the financial industry, which makes up a large proportion of the UK tax base.
1.7.1.3.1.6. Pro: A hard Brexit will have an [adverse](https://www.which.co.uk/news/2019/04/what-will-brexit-mean-for-house-prices/) [impact](https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/28/bank-of-england-says-no-deal-brexit-would-be-worse-than-2008-crisis?usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D&amp_js_v=0.1#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2018%2Fnov%2F28%2Fbank-of-england-says-no-deal-brexit-would-be-worse-than-2008-crisis) on our housing market, and interest rates could rise. This could leave people in negative equity with higher mortgage payments, that some may not be able to afford and potentially people having their homes repossessed.
1.7.1.3.1.6.1. Con: There are consistent complaints that prices are too high for young people to get on the property ladder, and for them this would be seen as a positive effect on the housing market.
1.7.1.3.1.6.1.1. Pro: Brexit is a brilliant idea if you're a [disaster capitalist](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans).
1.7.1.3.1.6.1.2. Con: Most people would not describe the financial ruin of potentially hundreds of thousands of households as a positive effect on the housing market, even if it meant they could milk the despair of their fellow man for quick profit.
1.7.1.3.1.7. Pro: The EU directs [considerable investment](http://blog.policy.manchester.ac.uk/brexit/2017/10/uk-regional-development-in-the-context-of-brexit/) towards poorer regions of the UK that the national government tends to ignore.
1.7.1.3.1.7.1. Pro: The British government [spends significantly more money](https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/new-transport-figures-reveal-north-to-receive-indefensible-2-555-less-per-person-than-london) on transport infrastructure per head in London than anywhere else in the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.7.1.1. Con: This is because the London area has the oldest rail network, and is subject to the most strain with the largest population increase and thus increase in usage, of any location in the UK. Plus the fragmented nature of the network pushes up costs - London is the [hub](https://www.ft.com/content/d82848ca-f7ba-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00) where a lot of this fragmentation meets.
1.7.1.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con: London does not have the UK's oldest train network. The rail networks around Liverpool, Manchester and most of Scotland are significantly older.
1.7.1.3.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: London's rail network is fragmented because it is run by 38 separate private contractors.
1.7.1.3.1.7.1.1.3. Con: Geographically, London is in no way the nexus point for the British railway. It is only the centre of this matrix by choice, not divine, immutable intervention.
1.7.1.3.1.7.2. Pro: The [European Investment Bank](http://www.eib.org/) is the largest multilateral investment bank in the world \(bigger than the World Bank\), and lent [36 billion euros](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7847) between 2011 and 2016 to British institutions, with less developed areas \(particularly in West Wales and the South West of England\) receiving more per person than other areas.
1.7.1.3.1.8. Con: The UK could create a more competitive environment for attracting companies.
1.7.1.3.1.8.1. Con: Many companies [are leaving or thinking about leaving](https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/half-of-big-european-companies-cut-uk-investment-over-brexit-survey-shows-1.743895) the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.8.1.1. Pro: Even the pro-Brexit 'traitor' bashing [Daily Mail](https://twitter.com/AngryScotland/status/888820533512609793?s=19) is quietly considering moving to its Irish offices in Dublin to continue enjoying the benefits of EU membership.
1.7.1.3.1.8.2. Pro: The EU mandates that the UK not have less than a [15% VAT](http://www.blandbaker.co.uk/sites/www.blandbaker.co.uk/files/blandbakerpwp_apu_oct16_vatafterbrexit30.9.16.pdf). Once free from these regulations the UK could lower this and gain a competitive advantage to encourage growth and investment.
1.7.1.3.1.8.2.1. Con: As UK VAT currently stands at 20%, there was room for the Government to lower the tax without exiting the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.8.3. Pro: It has been [proposed](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446407/brexit-uk-deregulation-parliament-should-seize-opportunity) that the UK could form a commission to cut back on EU regulations post Brexit by almost a quarter. This would save the UK between £33 billion \($43 billion\) and £140 billion \($182 billion\) annually and bring more industry and investment into the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.8.3.1. Con: EU regulations protect the health and safety of its citizens. Severely cutting them back would be a risky measure.
1.7.1.3.1.8.3.2. Con: EU officials have [stated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-trade-deal-workers-rights-tax-haven-michel-barnier-environmental-legislation-a7851761.html) they will not sign a trade deal with the UK if they begin a deregulatory "race to the bottom".
1.7.1.3.1.8.3.3. Con: Deregulation doesn't automatically mean less stress on public finances or higher economic performance.
1.7.1.3.1.8.3.3.1. Pro: [Deregulation](https://smartasset.com/taxes/do-sin-taxes-affect-cigarette-and-alcohol-consumption) of drugs, tabacco and alcohol would lead to higher consumption of these substances and higher frequency of negative health related issues. Hence higher stress for NHS and public health budgets.
1.7.1.3.1.8.3.3.2. Pro: Unregulated capitalism leads to creation of monopolies, which in turn decreases competition.
1.7.1.3.1.8.4. Con: The UK is already a competitive market for companies under the status quo. Trade barriers will only [harm](https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jun/07/brexit-make-uk-businesses-less-competitive) this.
1.7.1.3.1.9. Pro: The EU is responsible for the funding/loans behind many of the UK's largest infrastructure projects.
1.7.1.3.1.9.1. Pro: The macroeconomic effects and uncertainty caused by Brexit are likely to [slow down](https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/~/media/files/insights/publications/2016/06/eu-referendum-brexit-and-the-impact-on-uk-infrastructure/eureferendumukinfrastructurealert.pdf) infrastructure spending.
1.7.1.3.1.9.1.1. Pro: Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank, said it was [inevitable](https://www.ft.com/content/aaaaa9cc-b1b2-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8) that lending to the UK would fall from recent levels of about £7bn a year once it left the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.9.1.2. Pro: The uncertainty around whether the new regulatory landscape of the UK will be in line with EU regulations is already [causing delays](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/15/uk-infrastructure-projects-could-be-hit-by-european-investment-bank-concerns) in investment, putting jobs at risk.
1.7.1.3.1.9.2. Pro: The UK is one of the largest shareholders \(16%\) in the European Investment Bank \(EIB\), granting it [considerable leverage](https://fullfact.org/economy/uks-stake-european-investment-bank/) to be able to direct the Bank's funding towards its own projects. By leaving the EU, and thereby leaving the Bank, the UK loses access to this pool of money.
1.7.1.3.1.9.2.1. Pro: The UK has already experienced [a significant reduction](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-financial-affairs-subcommittee/news-parliament-2017/brexit-eib-report-published/) in funding from the EIB as a result of Brexit preparations.
1.7.1.3.1.9.2.2. Pro: The European Investment Bank loaned £1 billion towards the cost of [Crossrail](http://www.crossrail.co.uk/news/articles/tfl-agrees-1bn-loan-for-crossrail-from-european-investment-bank).
1.7.1.3.1.9.3. Con: The UK is [seeking to maintain its membership](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eib-european-investment-bank-davis-davis-eu-negotiations-a7932671.html) of the European Investment Bank \(EIB\) after Brexit. If that happens, there will be a minimal effect, if any, on procurement for infrastructure spending.
1.7.1.3.1.9.3.1. Con: Maintaining access to the EIB would require a deal with EU, a prospect that would be costly to the UK and at the moment seems unlikely to even occur.
1.7.1.3.1.9.3.2. Con: In order for the UK to remain a member of the EIB, all the constitution of the Bank would have to be [amended](https://fullfact.org/economy/uks-stake-european-investment-bank/) and all remaining member states would have to agree to this change. This is by no means a given.
1.7.1.3.1.9.4. Con: With regards to funding, the UK is a [net contributor](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) to the EU. This means that following Brexit the UK could fund all the currently EU funded projects in the UK and still have money left over. With regards to loans, if the UK wishes to borrow money it can do so. It is not necessary to borrow exclusively from the EU. The UK does not do so now and would not need to in the future.
1.7.1.3.1.9.4.1. Con: The problem with this argument is that it does not take into account the efficiencies generated by doing some things at the EU level. It will probably cost the UK more to do them on their own.  [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8SyXnDMfio)
1.7.1.3.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.4.7.
1.7.1.3.1.11. Pro: A hard Brexit would result in short-term regulatory chaos.
1.7.1.3.1.11.1. Pro: When we leave the EU, we will become a 'third country' in terms of data protection. This will cause business no end of effort and expense when transferring data to the EEA and beyond, unless there is an 'adequacy decision' issued. [EU: the UK will be a 'third country' for personal data transfers from the point of Brexit](https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2018/january/eu-the-uk-will-be-a-third-country-for-personal-data-transfers-from-the-point-of-brexit1/)
1.7.1.3.1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.1.2.
1.7.1.3.1.11.3. Pro: [Inadequate customs contingency](https://www.ft.com/content/5ae67bea-ca0e-11e7-aa33-c63fdc9b8c6c) planning could lead to gridlock in Kent and resulting in delayed deliveries to businesses in the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.11.3.1. Pro: Sainsbury's, a major supermarket chain, is worried about [food rotting](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sainsburys-ceo-mike-coupe-brexit-food-eu-goods-uk-border-a7927606.html) at the border.
1.7.1.3.1.11.4. Pro: Leaving Euratom, the EU's atomic energy community, could cause [energy supplies to be disrupted](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39774062) due to the lack of equivalent national regulatory body, and the inability to source vital components from Europe.
1.7.1.3.1.11.5. Pro: Regulatory misalignment between the UK and EU could result in a [prohibition on data sharing](https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/brexit-could-put-data-sharing-jeopardy) between the two zones, causing serious problems for businesses.
1.7.1.3.1.11.6. Pro: [Insurance contracts](http://www.lmalloyds.com/LMA/News/Blog/brexit_cliffedge.aspx), vital to companies' ability to manage risk, could face serious difficulty transferring between UK and EU jurisdictions.
1.7.1.3.1.11.7. Pro: A hard Brexit will result in a [legal and regulatory no-man's land](http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-political-economic-and-legal-chaos-risked-by-a-no-deal-brexit-uk-changing-europe-2017-7) with nobody entirely confident of what laws and regulations still apply. Disputes will therefore take far longer to resolve, bringing up costs and throwing into disarray trade relations between businesses.
1.7.1.3.1.11.7.1. Pro: Many international contracts will [lack](https://www.ft.com/content/a9204df0-da84-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) the details to deal with a new customs border between the UK and the EU. Potentially reviewing thousands of contracts will take a lot of time, but re-negotiating them will take significantly longer, increasing costs and creating a large degree of uncertainty.
1.7.1.3.1.11.8. Con: The UK is planning on [staying within the remit](https://www.ft.com/content/64d30780-10b5-11e7-b030-768954394623) of some of the regulatory agencies of the EU after Brexit, minimising the so-called regulatory upheaval.
1.7.1.3.1.11.8.1. Con: Without a trade deal or open borders, staying in any regulatory remit will mean very little.
1.7.1.3.1.11.9. Con: Brexit is a golden opportunity to get [rid](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2017/03/28/brexit-golden-chance-throw-eu-regulations-bonfire/) of cumbersome EU regulations that the UK has no need for.
1.7.1.3.1.11.9.1. Con: As the most [regulation-happy](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/08/social_media_explanation/) member State of the EU, the [UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nanny-state-index-state-interference-smoking-drinking-junk-food-a7727571.html) is more likely to diverge from the EU as a [nanny](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-45356189) State.
1.7.1.3.1.11.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.8.3.
1.7.1.3.1.11.9.3. Con: Supporters of deregulation [won't identify](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-david-davis-tax-haven-cut-regulations-after-leaving-eu-based-on-nothing-european-commission-a8218481.html) or are [not upfront about](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/backlash-liam-foxs-total-secrecy-uk-us-trade-talks/) which regulations need to be scrapped and how they are currently cumbersome.
1.7.1.3.1.11.9.4. Con: It is not certain that deregulation will save money. In fact, the government's own [2014 report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227069/2901084_SingleMarket_acc.pdf) into the functioning of the single market states "... integration has brought to \[...\] the UK, in most if not all observers’ opinions, appreciable economic benefits". \[...\] Is that trade-off, between cost and benefit, between economics and politics, of overall benefit to the UK? ... Most observers, and indeed most of the evidence received for this report, answer positively." \(p.6\).
1.7.1.3.1.11.9.5. Con: There is no certainty that a more deregulated society is a direction that would win support from the general public, especially when it comes to environmental and labour regulations. A future government hoping to be elected on such a manifesto might not get elected, and therefore, such deregulation may never get implemented. In short, these economical advantages are highly hypothetical and speculative, not just on an economical level, but also on the political level.
1.7.1.3.1.11.10. Pro: The UK will have to create national substitutes of the regulatory institutions that the UK benefits from as members of the EU. The UK will lose out on the economies of scale that the EU has and have costs in setting them up and running them.
1.7.1.3.1.12. Con: The UK would save [billions of pounds](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) in annual EU contributions.
1.7.1.3.1.12.1. Con: The net gain from leaving has to be compared to the loss to the economy from leaving the free trade area. The impact of leaving the free trade zone is [estimated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/carney-says-u-k-economy-is-feeling-brexit-effect-in-short-term) to be greater than the savings in contributions to the EU  budget.
1.7.1.3.1.12.2. Pro: The UK pays [more money](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) into the EU budget than it gets back in EU spending in the UK. In 2016, the UK payed £13.1 billion and the EU in return spent £4.5 billion on the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.13. Con: Many regions in the UK are economically unaffected by EU membership in the first place. Therefore, a hard Brexit is unlikely to economically damage sizeable parts of the UK economy.
1.7.1.3.1.13.1. Pro: Poorer regions where inequality was high and quality of life has declined [usually voted for Brexit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36616028), despite the comparatively small impact of the EU in these regions.
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.7.
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.2. Pro: The EU's guidelines leave the responsibility of dealing with regional inequality in countries down to national governments. It is therefore wrong to blame regional inequality on the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.2.1. Pro: The EU's Principle of Subsidiarity leaves decisions that are more efficiently taken at a national/regional level down to the respective nations or regions. \([Article 5\(3\) of the Treaty on European Union](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/7/the-principle-of-subsidiarity)\)
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the UK, all [17 operations](https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/factsheets/2014/cohesion-policy-and-the-united-kingdom) within the EU's Cohesion Policy \(as part of EU regional management\) are managed directly by the UK itself.
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.3. Pro: London, the area that is most heavily intregated and reliant on European legislation, voted [overwhelmingly to Remain](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36612916).
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.4. Pro: Leave voters were disportionately clustered in areas where [immigration ​was low](http://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138).
1.7.1.3.1.13.1.5. Pro: Stronger than expected support for Leave in Sunderland has been accredited to [rising unemployment, inequality and feeling of being ignored by the Westminster establishment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRQ8DryTWQ).
1.7.1.3.1.14. Pro: The UK's trading relationship with the EU will become less profitable.
1.7.1.3.1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2. Pro: Businesses could lose their [passporting](https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/brexit-means-brexit-everywhere-uk-banks-will-lose-eu-passporting-rights-barnier-36336220.html) rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.1. Pro: Over [5,400](https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/brexit-means-brexit-everywhere-uk-banks-will-lose-eu-passporting-rights-barnier-36336220.html) British firms rely on passporting rights to bring in £9 billion in revenue every year to Britain.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.2. Pro: Loss of passporting rights would mean the [immediate end](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-talks-collapse-negotiations-eu-uk-theresa-may-david-davis-no-deal-wto-a7955471.html) to any business UK banks had in the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.2.1. Pro: As a result, since the Brexit vote, many banks and financial firms have begun establishing EU bases to take their operations [out](http://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit/81116/brexit-and-the-british-economy) of the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.2.2. Con: Losing passporting rights only [involves a restructuring of operations](http://www.cityam.com/249639/moodys-says-uk-banks-dont-need-eu-passporting-rights) in order to continue offering financial services in Europe.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.2.3. Con: Zurich, Switzerland, is the [second most competitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Financial_Centres_Index) banking centre in Europe after London despite not having passporting rights.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.2.3.1. Con: Switzerland benefits from a more open [freedom of movement agreement](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/839032/brexit-news-latest-switzerland-germany-economy-finance-banking-european-union) with the EU than the UK will have after Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.2.3.2. Con: Switzerland has made many [ethical trade offs](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/05/tax-gap-avoidance-switzerland) to ensure their competitive edge in the banking sector.
1.7.1.3.1.14.2.3. Pro: Services includes much of the UK's computing industry, such as apps sold online.
1.7.1.3.1.14.3. Pro: Britain will default to trading under the worst possible terms with the EU in the immediate aftermath of Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.14.3.1. Pro: Britain could become a 'third country', meaning trading with the world under the worst possible tariff rules. Even after a period spent establishing its position [under WTO rules](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/no-deal-the-wto-option/), the UK will almost certainly still suffer.
1.7.1.3.1.14.4. Pro: UK companies that participate in security-sensitive EU industry collaborations would suffer.
1.7.1.3.1.14.4.1. Pro: Britan's satellite industry might very well lose out on the [Galileo](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21741593-britain-struggles-stay-europes-most-important-space-project-britains-space-industry) project.
1.7.1.3.1.14.4.2. Pro: Airbus has already [announced](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21741593-britain-struggles-stay-europes-most-important-space-project-britains-space-industry) that it will move part of it's satellite making operations from Britain to France.
1.7.1.3.1.15. Con: Economic forecasts are [inherently unreliable](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/02/economic-forecasting-flawed-science-data) due to the infinite range of variables involved. Given that, it is impossible to accurately predict the economic consequences of Brexit, or whether the UK economy would be better off in or out of the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.15.1. Pro: The [Bank of England](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/715480/Carney-Brexit-Bank-England-admits-Britain-economic-outlook-POSITIVE-EU) and [David Cameron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDS027L8YMo&app=desktop) made very pessimistic predictions during the referendum about the impact of a leave vote and then later admitted these were overstated.
1.7.1.3.1.15.2. Con: The weather is also governed by a near infinite range of variables and while forecasts are often wrong, they provide a more accurate picture than random guesses.
1.7.1.3.1.15.3. Con: Economic forecasts are not predictions. They are a tool that supports evidence based policy making, such as the [decision](https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/economy/economic-growth/news/77895/bank-england-cuts-interest-rates-and-boosts-quantitative) of the Bank of England after the referendum vote to cut interest rates and boost quantitive easing, to ward off the worst effects of the fall of the pound.
1.7.1.3.1.16. Con: The UK is too focused on ties to Europe. Diversified international trade deals are more lucrative.
1.7.1.3.1.16.1. Pro: Whilst the EU is a primary trading block, [compared](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Intra_EU_exports_of_goods_compared_with_Extra_EU_exports_of_goods_by_Member_State,_2016_\(%25\).png) to other major EU economies the UK is more tilted to trade outside the EU, giving it more resilience and more opportunities within other trade for good pacts.
1.7.1.3.1.16.2. Pro: Trade in non-physical goods rose \(80%\) from 2006-2016. Whereas physical goods had a 40% increase. So physical proximity will be increasingly [less important](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/wts2017_e/WTO_Chapter_02_e.pdf) to overall trade. It's as easy to do financial services for someone on the other side of the planet as it is with a person in the country next to you.
1.7.1.3.1.16.2.1. Con: Trade in many non-physical goods oftens relies on trade agreements and single market agreements, which is why the [EU is the UK's largest service trading partner](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/bulletins/exportsandimportsstatisticsbycountryforuktradeinservices/julytoseptember2018). A Hard Brexit would cripple EU-UK service trade.
1.7.1.3.1.16.3. Pro: The 'anglosphere' of countries with English as a primary business language puts the UK at an advantage in new global trade deals with US/Canada/Australia/India/Nigeria.
1.7.1.3.1.16.3.1. Con: Countries within the EU teach English as a second language as it is considered the number one language for business in the world.
1.7.1.3.1.16.4. Con: Even if the US and Britain are able to come to an agreement quickly, Britain is [unable](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/22/the-uk-is-preparing-11-post-brexit-trade-deals-and-it-might-all-be-for-nothing.html), per EU rules, to sign new deals until the Brexit process is completed.
1.7.1.3.1.16.4.1. Con: Although Britain cannot officially sign independent trade deals while still a member of the EU, Britain has [informal arrangements](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5315524/britain-lines-up-post-brexit-trade-deals/) with 36 countries to implement free trade agreements once Britain officially exits.
1.7.1.3.1.16.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.2.1.5.1.1.
1.7.1.3.1.16.4.3. Con: It is unlikely any trade deal with another country will be signed immediately. Negotiations for any trade deal will take time, so the UK should start now rather than starting the process after it leaves the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.16.5. Con: Before the referendum Britain [relied](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/23/news/economy/us-uk-trade-talks-start/index.html) on experienced EU negotiators to secure lucrative trade deals. Many of Britain's new trade officials are novices, and thus at a disadvantage negotiating new agreements.
1.7.1.3.1.16.5.1. Con: The Department for International Trade has [hired high-calibre trade negotiators](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/06/16/uk-hires-top-new-zealand-trade-negotiator-head-post-brexit-deals/) to fill the experience gap.
1.7.1.3.1.16.5.2. Pro: Not only is the British negotiating team not sufficiently qualified, they are also [understaffed](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e): Whitehall's Trade Policy Group employ's 300 people, but the UK Trade Policy Observatory, an independent think-tank, says they need at least 700 people.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6. Pro: On balance, the EU is a [barrier](https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/how-the-european-union-s-protectionism-is-hurting-developing-economies-26771) to global free trade. A hard Brexit will remove this barrier, allowing the UK to pursue profitable free trade agreements with other countries.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1. Pro: The EU prevents member states from striking their own free trade deals with third countries, so a deal opening borders with India is only possible if the UK leaves.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1. Pro: While within the EU, the UK [can not negotiate](http://brexitcentral.com/uk-trade-agreements-before-brexit/) its own trade deals without consensus of all the member states. This makes it far harder to strike deals with important emerging economies like China and India for example.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.1. Con: The ability to do our own trade deals will only bring in an extra [0.6% GDP](https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/the-governments-own-brexit-analysis-says-the-uk-will-be). Far less than the losses from Brexit, especially Hard Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.2. Con: Trade deals tend to involve the liberalisation of immigration controls. Trade deals with [India](https://www.politico.eu/article/india-no-rush-to-do-bilateral-trade-deal-with-post-brexit-britain-commonwealth-eu-customs-union-external-tariffs/) would almost certainly increase immigration from those countries, to the displeasure of many Brexit voters.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.1.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: There are many different levels of trade deal. The strongest / most expansive Trade deals \(those with the [most advanced stage of economic integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement#By_level_of_integration)\) include eliminating labour barriers \([Common markets, Economic Unions, Economic and Monetary Unions, and Complete economic integrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_integration#Stages)\).
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.2.3. Con: A very common type of trade deal is a Free Trade Area, which typically does not include "[eliminating barriers for exchange of labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_integration#Stages)".
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3. Con: The EU is also looking at [partnerships](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-india-trade-germany-pushes-for-post-brexit-deal/) with India.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.1. Con: Yet such a trade deal is [possible](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-india-trade-germany-pushes-for-post-brexit-deal/) exactly because the UK is about to leave the EU. The two demands made by India - visa liberalisation and high tariffs on foreign wines and spirits - were heavily resisted by the UK during negotiations in 2013.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2. Pro: The EU has been [working on a free trade agreement with India since 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93European_Union_relations#Free_trade_negotiations), which has not been successful after 7 rounds of negotiations. The UK is a weaker economic force - if the EU can't do it, the UK alone can't either.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Without the negotiating leverage of the combined EU trade block, the UK will be unlikely to secure new trade deals on as favorable terms as it would have as a member of the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The UK wants free trade, as evidenced by the fact that it was a [key plank](https://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:sav235yoh/read/single#page/3/mode/1up) of the winning Leave campaign. All the protectionist conditions that the EU places on its trading partners are inherently unfavourable in the context of free trade.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: A [number of countries](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-partners-object-to-brexit-transition-roll-over/) which have trade deals with the EU wish to renegotiate terms of any post-Brexit deal with the UK to be more in their favour, and thus worse for the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Trade is not a zero sum game. Something that is in favour of a trading partner is not necessarily worse for the UK.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The EU charges a 16% tariff on oranges from south Africa to protect Big Spanish Orange. Oranges would be [cheaper](https://iea.org.uk/the-eus-thousands-of-senseless-tariffs-punish-the-poor/) if we left the EU and abolished this tariff, and we'd buy more south African oranges.  This is in the interests of both the UK and our trading partner south Africa.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: As the UK economy is already relatively global and deregulated, Britain has [limited leverage](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-trade-deal-thatcher-impact-european-union-single-market-deregulation-a8160026.html) when it comes to negotiating free trade deals.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The  narrative portrayed in the cited support article of Britain wanting to "dictate terms" and "have leverage" in trade negotiations is inherently false. Britain wants to pursue a free trade agenda. Protectionist attempts to dictate terms and use leverage are things that protectionist blocs like the EU do. Brexit is an opportunity to trade with the world unfettered by such chains.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Wanting unfettered access to all world markets is all well and good, getting such access is entirely another thing, and [not](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/20/business/post-brexit-britain-may-struggle-top-japan-eu-free-trade-deal/) [very](http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-trump-global-trade-war-uk-trade-deal-almost-impossible-2018-3) [likely](http://uk.businessinsider.com/ambassador-charles-ries-why-a-uk-us-trade-deal-will-be-difficult-2018-1).
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.3. Pro: The EU and India recently [adopted](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/10/06/india-summit-statements/) three joint declarations relating to counterterrorism, climate change, and sustainable development at the 14th EU-India summit.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.
1.7.1.3.1.16.6.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.7.1.3.1.16.7. Con: If we carve up the world in terms wealth, most of the 35 most wealthy are in Europe. The rest are really far away e.g. US. Canada, Australia, China, India and Japan.
1.7.1.3.1.16.8. Con: One of the main reasons to trade with Europe \(rather than other countries\) is distance. Distance equates to fuel and time. Increase either and cost increases, while fuel also increases our carbon footprint.
1.7.1.3.1.16.9. Pro: Commonwealth trade officials are currently pursuing [plans](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/mar/10/drive-to-replace-eu-trade-links-with-closer-ties-to-commonwealth-economies) for closer economic integration with the UK in the wake of Brexit.
1.7.1.3.1.16.9.1. Con: Good trade agreements are based on trust and goodwill. Theresa May has already damaged that through her "Hostile Environment" policies which led to the Windrush Scandal. "It is a matter of denial of the dignity of citizenship, which really cannot be restored," - Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. [uk.reuters.com](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-chogm-windrush/trouble-in-the-family-uks-migrant-embarrassment-undermines-commonwealth-reunion-idUKKBN1HQ1ZM)
1.7.1.3.1.16.10. Pro: The EU is not the place where most economic growth is occurring. The EU’s share of world GDP is forecast to [decline](http://www.betteroffout.net/the-case/10-eu-myths-about-withdrawl/) to 22% in 2025, down from 37% in 1973.
1.7.1.3.1.16.10.1. Con: This argument confuses growth with total volume in economic activity. Many areas of high relative growth still represent small markets. Even with slower growth relative to the rest of the world, the EU will remain the [UK's largest export market](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-trade-partners/).
1.7.1.3.1.16.10.2. Con: This argument neglects the barriers to trade imposed by geography. Even with falling transport costs, these act to increase the cost of UK goods in more distant markets such as China, Japan, and North and South America.
1.7.1.3.1.16.10.3. Con: This claim misleadingly suggests that EU trade is shrinking, by confusing GDP and growth with share of total world trade.  The EU has a smaller total share of world trade, because countries like China, India and South Korea have grown very quickly and now take much larger shares of total world trade than they used to. As more middle income countries grow, everyone is sharing a much bigger pie, meaning smaller percentages don't automatically mean less pie.
1.7.1.3.1.16.11. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.
1.7.1.3.1.16.12. Pro: The UK could pursue membership in [NAFTA](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-nafta/britain-could-join-nafta-if-brexit-trade-deal-fails-telegraph-newspaper-idUSKBN1CF18K).
1.7.1.3.1.16.12.1. Con: Joining NAFTA would require the UK to conform to the regulatory framework of the deal for goods and services, a framework that is [significantly different](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/29/could-the-uk-join-nafta-there-are-considerable-downsides/) to the one that the UK currently has as a member of the EU. The highly complex legislative changes would make trade difficult with the EU, and would undermine stability in British markets.
1.7.1.3.1.16.12.1.1. Pro: To benefit from preferential market access into NAFTA, UK exporters would, in certain cases, have to [significantly restructure](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/29/could-the-uk-join-nafta-there-are-considerable-downsides/) their production, supply and distribution chains to comply with the North American trading zone’s product standards and rules of origin. Industries such as the automotive one would have to produce two versions of the same product to export to both EU and NAFTA markets.
1.7.1.3.1.16.12.2. Con: Joining NAFTA would [expose](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/29/could-the-uk-join-nafta-there-are-considerable-downsides/) a range of UK manufacturing and agriculture sectors to highly competitive US and Mexican exports, undermining domestic industry.
1.7.1.3.1.16.12.3. Con: The Trump administration is currently [renegotiating](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/business/how-the-trump-administration-is-doing-renegotiating-nafta.html) NAFTA. This means that not only will the UK have to wait for those negotiations to complete, it currently cannot know if the deal will actually be advantageous for it to join.
1.7.1.3.1.16.12.4. Pro: Joining NAFTA will increase trade with the US, Mexico, and Canada, whose combined GDP reached GPB 17.2 trillion in 2017. This [outweighs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/10/britain-could-join-nafta-trade-alliance-us-canada-mexico-post/) the EU, at GPB 15.7 trillion.
1.7.1.3.1.16.12.5. Con: The effect of distance on trade is a well studied issue in economics. Whilst we could boost trade with other countries they will be further away, increasing the costs, so it is unlikely we will ever find ourselves trading as much with NAFTA or other distant trade organisations, as we will with countries in Europe. If we do it will be [more expensive, and more environmentally damaging](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/credit/documents/papers/11-02.pdf) than if we could trade with the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.16.13. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.2.1.
1.7.1.3.1.16.14. Con: The EU remains Britain's [largest trade partner](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-trade-partners/), accounting for 48% of goods exports from the UK in 2017, justifying Britain's focus on the EU.
1.7.1.3.1.17. Con: Damage to the UK economy was advised by both sides during the campaign, with different degrees of the damage, but the majority decided that other benefits will outweigh short economic disadvantages.
1.7.1.3.1.17.1. Con: Warnings of economic damage were almost always dismissed as 'Project Fear' by Leave politicians. Many people weren't aware of any short term damage to the economy and some Leavers now predict up to 30 years of 'short term' economic pain. [Link](https://twitter.com/OFOCBrexit/status/1009884621306302464?s=19)
1.7.2. Pro: Theresa May has [refused](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nhs-us-trade-deal-talks-privatisation-healthcare-trump-a8198871.html) to rule out when asked in Parliament if the NHS would be part of any trade deal discussions with America.
1.7.2.1. Pro: US law allows American authorities to [access data held overseas in order to tackle crime and terrorism](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nhs-us-trade-deal-talks-privatisation-healthcare-trump-a8198871.html), potentially including British patients if they are given greater access to the NHS.
1.7.2.2. Pro: This raises risks of [higher costs of drugs for British patients](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/15/trump-threatens-use-us-trade-talks-force-nhs-pay-drugs/) as the US has pushed for higher drug prices in Brexit trade negotiations as part of their ''put American patients first'' scheme.
1.7.3. Con: If the UK will regain control over immigration, the demand side of the equation in the health service can be stopped in its increase. Migration is linked to [82% of population growth between 2001 and 2016](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6088861/Migration-82-UKs-population-growth.html) - immigrants and their children. 1991 to 2017 [estimated net not-British immigration into the UK at 6,076,000](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics).
1.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.6.
1.7.3.3. Con: A tiny fraction of the UK's immigrants from the EU were from the [over 65 or under 15 age ranges](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/), the groups that create most of the demand for healthcare. Increased demand for healthcare has been driven almost exclusively by the ageing of the native UK population.
1.7.3.4. Con: The [proportion of dependents was much higher](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/) in other non-EU groups. If this was a serious concern, then it would be far more effective for the UK to simply limit movement from these regions.
1.7.4. Con: A clean Brexit would enable the UK to move away from applying competition law to the NHS, something which is currently more difficult due to EU regulations \([pg. 4](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/procurement-competition-rules-kings-fund-mar-2015.pdf)\).
1.7.4.1. Pro: While the UK itself has competition law that applies to the NHS this [cannot be reformed](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#procurement-and-competition) as it is echoed by European regulations. This could be changed after Brexit.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Competition law [has prevented](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/15/competition-killing-nhs-bournemouth-poole) the NHS from enacting mergers that could improve care and reduce costs.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Competition law has allowed private health providers to [challenge](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/15/competition-killing-nhs-bournemouth-poole) the NHS for failure to refer services, creating expensive legal fees. This risks clinicians within the NHS experiencing a "[chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)" whereby they are discouraged from referring patients to public providers, over private ones, even when it is the best clinical decision.
1.7.4.4. Con: EU competition law only applies to 'undertakings'. When acting in a way connected with 'the exercise of the powers of a public authority', or providing services based on solidarity, an entity is not an undertaking. The NHS therefore does not have to qualify as an 'undertaking' for the purpose of EU competition law. \([Case CJEU: Wouters v Algemene Raad van de Nederlandsche Orde van Advocaten, , 2002, paragraph 57](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddb41c0a5e81dc4ed98c5ed39e5d840d7a.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyNchb0?text=&docid=46722&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=239325)\)
1.7.4.4.1. Pro: Scotland and Wales essentially avoid competition law by not treating health services as commercial agreements, but rather as something provided as a public service. This is consistent with the EU regulations and could be followed throughout the UK without Brexit \(Collins, B. 2015 [pg. 5](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/procurement-competition-rules-kings-fund-mar-2015.pdf)\)
1.7.5. Con: A hard Brexit could improve the quality of service provision and medical staff.
1.7.5.1. Pro: The EU working time directive, which restricts the amount of work a week to 48 hours, has had significant benefits for healthcare staff but it is also inflexible. This inflexibility has a [negative effect](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/about-the-rcs/government-relations-and-consultation/working-time-directive-taskforce/) on the training of doctors.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: The minor changes required to make the working time directive more flexible for training are already being [considered by EU bodies](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-flexibility-for-nhs-doctors-under-european-working-time-directive) in coordination with UK authorities. Such reforms that are beneficial to the UK can take place within the EU.
1.7.5.2. Pro: After Brexit, the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council could require [competency tests](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#regulation-of-life-sciences-and-health-care) for practitioners who trained in the EU. This is relevant as there is considerable variation in the way doctors are trained across Europe
1.7.5.2.1. Pro: Oncologists in the UK are trained in both radiation and chemotherapy, whereas in some parts of Europe they may focus on one \(House of Commons [pg. 25](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhealth/640/640.pdf)\)
1.7.5.3. Con: After Brexit UK doctors, and by extension their patients, will be unable to access the [European Reference Networks](https://ec.europa.eu/health/ern/overview_en). These networks bring together experts from around Europe to assist in caring for patients with rare diseases. This loss will reduce the quality of care these people receive.
1.7.5.4. Con: The [Special EU Programmes Body](https://www.seupb.eu/iva-overview) funds specific initiatives in Northern Ireland that tackle the problems caused by having a border. [These include](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#the-regulation-of-workers) initiatives aimed at supporting children with mental health needs and community care. The vast majority of this funding comes from the EU.
1.7.6. Pro: Brexit will interfere with the supply of goods for the NHS.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Continued EU membership [guarantees](https://news.sky.com/story/pharmacists-preparing-to-stockpile-medicines-and-medical-supplies-for-no-deal-brexit-11441089) the long term security of medicines.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Many goods supplied to the NHS have complex supply chains. [For example](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#customs-and-trade), the main supplier of NHS needles produces them in Plymouth but distributes them from Belgium. A hard Brexit will interrupt this movement of products and increase their cost.
1.7.6.3. Pro: Some medical goods, such as radioisotopes and a number of biological agents, have a shelf-life that's [measured in hours](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#medical-radioisotopes). Any delay at customs could be detrimental.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: The UK government would unquestionably put in place arrangements to prevent customs delay on inward movement of such goods.
1.7.6.4. Pro: The depreciation of the Pound against the Euro has already cost the NHS [considerably](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/01/nhs-already-crisis-brexit-could-finish-it) as at least half of the products used come from overseas. It is [likely](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pound-sterling-latest-updates-price-value-brexit-currency-dollar-amundi-fund-manager-a8217381.html) that a hard Brexit would cause a further depreciation of the value of the Pound.
1.7.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.1.
1.7.7. Pro: A large number of British pensioners are able to live in Europe and receive healthcare from European systems because of Britain's membership of the EU. If the UK were to leave, some of these pensioners would have to return, costing the NHS \(on net\) approximately [half a billion pounds](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/news-item/nhs-could-face-bill-of-over-half-a-billion-pounds-from-brexit).
1.7.7.1. Con: The estimate of increased costs is highly derived and unclear if it is true or not. The report only considers the cost to the NHS of pensioners returning to the UK, getting older and using more services. It does not consider the economic benefit of those pensioners spending their money locally which will bolster UK tax revenue, rather than that of Spain or France.
1.7.7.2. Con: That the NHS is so much less efficient than the health services of other EU countries is a reason for NHS reform, not a reason not to leave the EU.
1.7.7.3. Con: In the grand scheme of things, half a billion pounds is not very much \(it would fund the NHS for around 1.5 days, based on a yearly budget of [£116 billion](https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx)\).
1.7.8. Con: Currently new medicines used in the UK need to be approved by the European Medical Authority. After Brexit the equivalent UK body could be [more flexible](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/research/brexit-relationship-eu-shape-nhs#finding-a-system-that-works-for-medicines) and fast-track the approval of medicines, which had already been approved by other regulators \(including the European and American Authorities\).
1.7.8.1. Con: A pharmaceutical company looking to market their drug will have the choice between two markets: a one-country UK, or a 27-country European Union. Pharmaceutical companies are a business, and the most effective strategy would be to sell to as many countries \(and therefore people\) as possible -- this means the UK will be second-choice \(or later\) in the pecking order for medicine approval, meaning it won't "fast-track" drugs, but instead the converse.
1.7.8.2. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.3.
1.7.8.3. Con: That is an extremely dangerous practice. Fast tracking medicines without proper approval systems will lead to mistakes being made. The EU has a lengthy approval process to protect peoples health from profit hungry pharmaceutical companies.
1.7.9. Pro: When the UK tightened its immigration policy for non-EU citizens this had a [negative effect](https://fullfact.org/immigration/immigration-and-nhs-staff/) on recruitment of hospital staff. It is likely a restriction on EU immigrants would have the same effect.
1.7.9.1. Con: The UK has [just increased immigration quotas](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/14/sajid-javid-confirms-cap-on-foreign-doctors-and-nurses-will-be-lifted) for doctors and nurses from non-EU countries showing that it is not necessary to have completely unfettered free movement in order to effect adequate NHS recruitment from other countries.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.4.1.
1.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.4.7.2.
1.7.9.3. Pro: From the 2016/17 year to the 2017/2018 year, there has been an [87% reduction](https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/uk-public-support-recruitment-of-eu-nurses-post-brexit) in nursing registrants from EU countries since the referendum.
1.7.9.3.1. Con: There have recently been [strict new English proficiency tests](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/24/english-speaking-ovserseas-nurses-fail-nhs-too-tough-language-test) that are preventing many people being eligible to apply for nursing positions, and so it is not clear whether the referendum has had a significant impact on nursing applications.
1.7.9.3.2. Con: Numbers of non-EU international nurse recruits has [increased markedly](https://www.health.org.uk/chart/chart-large-drop-in-the-number-of-new-nurses-coming-from-the-eu-to-work-in-the-uk) since the 2016 referendum, and are at their highest levels since 2007/08. In 2017/18 overall international registrants were higher than in 2009/10 or 2010/11, suggesting fears of a collapse in international recruits are overblown.
1.7.9.3.2.1. Con: The source indicates that the inflow of nurses from non-EU countries has not increased enough to [compensate](https://www.health.org.uk/chart/chart-large-drop-in-the-number-of-new-nurses-coming-from-the-eu-to-work-in-the-uk) for the drop from EU nursing applicants.
1.7.9.4. Con: The immigration policy won't be applying to just the eu. The whole point is we have one policy applied to the whole world encouraging those with skills to come here. Hospital staff constitute those with skills and thus there will be allowances for those coming here to fill those jobs. Infact instead of non eu citizens who could work as hospital staff being blocked because numbers of internal non skilled eu immigrants were too high and thus external skilled quotas had to be cut.
1.7.9.5. Con: Looking solely at the number of recruits and not the quality of recruits gives a misleading picture. Recruiting large numbers of staff with poor technical and/or language skills is not a good long term strategy for the NHS.
1.7.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.9.3.1.
1.7.9.6. Con: EU immigrants make up [only 5% of NHS staff](https://fullfact.org/immigration/immigration-and-nhs-staff/), therefore the effect will not be so pronounced.
1.7.9.6.1. Con: The impact of losing 5% of NHS staff will be more pronounced as the system is already under the strain of staff shortages. [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/13/nhs-faces-acute-and-growing-staffing-shortage-warns-agency)
1.7.9.6.2. Con: The "Hostile environment" towards immigrants created by Theresa May and compounded by Brexit will not only make NHS recruitment much more difficult from the EU, but for medical staff from outside the EU too.
1.7.9.6.2.1. Con: The 'Hostile Environment' refers ONLY to illegal immigrants not to legal ones.["We’re going to give illegal migrants a really hostile reception".](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9291483/Theresa-May-interview-Were-going-to-give-illegal-migrants-a-really-hostile-reception.html)
1.7.9.6.2.1.1. Con: That was the stated goal, but it worked out that lots of legal immigrants were [targeted](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43782241) too.
1.7.9.6.3. Con: The NHS is one of the largest employers in the world employing just over a million "full time equivalent" posts - "only" 5% is roughly 50,000 FTEs - more than we're already short by for nurses e.g. [40,000 nurse FTEs.](https://fullfact.org/health/are-we-short-40000-nurses/)
1.7.9.7. Pro: About [10% of doctors](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40015269) come from the EU, leaving this workforce is particularly vulnerable to reductions in immigration.
1.7.9.7.1. Con: -> See 1.7.9.1.
1.7.9.7.2. Pro: Almost a third of newly-registered nurses in the UK had [trained in the EEA](https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/news-item/nhs-could-face-bill-of-over-half-a-billion-pounds-from-brexit). \(2016\)
1.7.10. Pro: The Caribbean island of Anguilla is a British Overseas Territory. It [relies heavily](http://westindiacommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-White-Paper-on-Anguilla-and-Brexit.pdf) on access to the neighbouring island of St Maarten, which is a French territory and therefore in the EU, especially for medical care. The islanders' access to healthcare will be devastated in the event of a Hard Brexit, as there are currently no backup plans.
1.8. Con: The supremacy of EU law impinges on Britain's ability to make laws to govern itself; by exiting the EU, Britain can make rules on any area it chooses.
1.8.1. Con: EU legislation around areas such as employment rights offers a framework of minimum standards to protect workers. Each EU member can improve on those standards through its own legislation. We already do so on matters such as [holiday pay](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-and-paid-holidays/#).
1.8.2. Con: The minimal amount of sovereignty Britain may win back from Europe is useless if it inhibits future governments from maintaining British prosperity. A Hard Brexit, with its economic and political consequences, calls this into question.
1.8.3. Pro: The future trajectory of the EU as a political union is incompatible with the UK retaining its sovereignty.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The European Union is [planning on replacing](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/decision-making-eu-tax-policy_en) the veto system of taxation for a qualified majority system. This movement of powers up is incompatible with the UK who are attempting to devolve powers such as taxation downwards, see differing income tax between Scotland and England for an example.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.13.1.2.1.
1.8.4. Pro: The EU is a [neoliberal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-european-unions-neoliberal-dilemma-1507147154) institution. As part of it, Britain is unable to pursue [socialist economic policies](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2017/07/lexit-eu-neoliberal-project-so-lets-do-something-different-when-we-leave-it), even if it was democratically mandated.
1.8.4.1. Con: EU rules do not push privatisation. The EU is [constitutionally required](https://fabians.org.uk/negotiating-the-red-lines/) to be neutral as regards public ownership or privatisation, and doesn’t prevent nationalisation of already privatised companies or the setting up of new ones.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: The EU [restricts interventionist government](http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/overview/index_en.html).
1.8.4.2. Pro: The [ban on tariffs](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/sell-abroad/import-export/index_en.htm) means countries cannot pursue protectionist economic policies to ensure domestic industries survive.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: The single market removes tariffs for its members, which is possible because it creates a level playing field with regulations \(e.g. on labour, standards and the environment\). There still are protective tariffs for exports originating from outside the EU, where rules are different, to prevent those countries gaining a competitive advantage over the EU countries \(cheap labour creates cheap products\).
1.8.4.2.2. Con: The UK does not like protective measures. It [rejected](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tata-steel-uk-government-accused-of-failing-to-protect-british-workers-by-blocking-eu-plans-to-allow-a6962446.html) the option to put tariffs on steel to protect the domestic steel industry, even when the EU proposed it.
1.8.4.3. Pro: The EU pursued [austerity policies](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/greece-debt-crisis-athens-accepts-harsh-austerity-as-bailout-deal-nears) in Greece, [against](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/19/greek-people-austerity-eu-greece-economic-crisis-democracy) the Greek people's wishes. This was made possible [by the ECB](https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-agrees-to-new-bailout-deal/), an EU institution.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: When any institution makes a loan they need to ensure such a loan can/will be repaid. It would be highly irresponsible for any organisation not to do so. The Greeks had to raise taxes to cover their spending, or reduce their spending.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: The additional loan given to the Greeks was the European Central Bank 's own money, thus they got to choose the terms. If the Greeks had refused then they would have simply defaulted, been forced into bankrupty, and then be forced into even worse austerity
1.8.4.3.3. Con: The ECB is part of the same system the national banks of [every EU member state, including the UK](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/overview_of_eu_institutions.html)(The ECB is part of the European System of Central Banks, which also includes the national central banks of all EU member states, whether they have adopted the euro or not.). Therefore member state governments can influence the ECB, and must be at least complicit with it's actions.
1.8.4.4. Con: EU employment law provides some of the [strongest safeguards](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/24/what-would-leaving-eu-mean--employment-rights) for workers in the world.
1.8.4.5. Con: The past six UK prime ministers \([Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#United_Kingdom), [Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism#United_Kingdom), [Blair](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/aug/06/society.labour), [Brown](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/04/gordon-browns-legacy-rampant-neoliberalism), [Cameron](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/david-cameron-and-the-neoliberal-undercurrents-of-state-austerity/), and [May](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-tory-manifesto-2017-david-cameron-right-wing-social-care-a7743146.html)\) have run government's with neoliberal policies. The UK does not want to pursue socialists economic policies, so it's ability to do so has never actually come under consideration.
1.8.4.6. Con: The EU is only a sum of the wills of its member states. If the UK citizenry wants to make the EU have more left-wing or protectionist policies, they can vote that way such that their domestic government and EU representatives will advocate for them.
1.8.4.6.1. Con: Whilst it would be possible for a future UK Socialist government and Socialist MEPs to influence the EU, this alone would not be enough to make a significant difference.
1.8.4.6.1.1. Pro: The majority of the EU countries have centre-right or right leaning parties in government, and extreme nationalist and populist parties like AfD are gaining footholds all over Europe.
1.8.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Political trends are fluid. Sometimes there's an authoritarian trend, sometimes there's a democratic trend. The parent assumes that just because the atmosphere is such and such today it will stay just like that frozen in time.
1.8.4.7. Con: EU membership hasn't prevented Sweden and Denmark's strong workers' rights, nor the Universal Basic Income in Finland.
1.8.5. Pro: EU laws [have supremacy](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-law-and-uk/) over the national laws of the UK.
1.8.5.1. Con: All supranational laws override national laws. International laws have to override national laws in order to be effective, otherwise governments that break international law can just point to their own national laws and say they acted legally deeming international laws useless.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Much of international law is consent-based governance. This means that a state member is not obliged to abide by this type of international law, [unless it has expressly consented](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) to a particular course of conduct, usually through [ratification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification) \(making international law/agreements into national law\).
1.8.5.1.2. Pro: And Trade Agreements have supremacy over national laws of the UK. And we will have Trade Agreements anyway.
1.8.5.2. Con: Despite EU laws technically having supremacy over domestic law, the UK wields substantial influence over both.
1.8.5.2.1. Pro: True, but as a large and influential EU member state, UK has a big say in the laws that apply EU-wide.
1.8.5.2.2. Pro: Many of the EU laws and regulations supposedly imposed on the UK were heavily influenced by UK officials working in Whitehall and Brussels. The UK has [disproportionate influence](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/is-the-uk-marginalised-in-the-eu-2/) across a range of policy areas in the EU and has used this to establish common policies across the EU that benefit the UK.
1.8.5.2.2.1. Con: The problem is that once these laws and regulations are established, they are almost impossible to change as they require consensus across the EU. This means that a change in UK government cannot undo what was wanted by a previous government, undermining democracy.
1.8.5.2.3. Pro: On the votes in the European Parliament, the majority agreed with the UK in [95% of cases](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-facts-behind-claims-uk-influence/). In 2%, the UK did not express an opinion.
1.8.5.2.3.1. Con: This still does not mean the UK has any power over the EU because it can't revoke the law when its citizens disagree, therefore it does not have sovereignty.
1.8.5.2.3.2. Con: Because the UK agreed with 95% of all cases does not necessarily mean that in those cases the policies were the most suitable for the UK, as the EU must provide policies that work to some extent for all members. The UK can agree with an EU policy and still believe an alternative option would work better for the UK.
1.8.5.2.4. Pro: Today, the British government remains solely responsible for the majority of policy actions that matter to voters, such as [health, welfare, pensions, border security, defense, and monetary policy](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-05-09-britain-eu-sovereignty-myth-niblett.pdf).
1.8.5.2.5. Pro: The United Kingdom controls more than 98 per cent of its public expenditure. \(Niblett, 2016, [pg. 1](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2016-05-09-britain-eu-sovereignty-myth-niblett.pdf)\).
1.8.5.3. Con: Much like in the US Federal laws override state laws. Or UK laws override local council laws.
1.8.6. Con: Brexit legislation has weakened parliamentary sovereignty. Government ministers can amend or repeal legislation without the need for parliamentary scrutiny, known as ["Henry VIII laws"](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/30/rights-for-the-chop-how-a-henry-viii-clause-in-the-great-repeal-bill-will-undermine-democracy/).
1.8.7. Con: It is unrealistic to expect that Britain will have perfect supremacy over its own laws, irrespective of its relationship with the EU.
1.8.7.1. Pro: With the EU being our [largest trading partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_United_Kingdom), we are likely to align our laws to make trading easier if we were outside it.  We are going to end up with most EU legislation being enacted, we will just be losing the ability to influence those laws.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: Even if current EU legislation is incorporated into UK law, the UK parliament can amend or repeal those laws in the future whenever there is will to do so and any further EU legislation can \(or not\) be incorporated at the will of parliament.
1.8.7.1.2. Con: The UK will still be able to make its own laws in sectors apart from trade, such as the environment, taxes, education, and justice, to name a few.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Leaving the EU will likely lead to an increase in the influence of actors other than the British public on UK law.
1.8.7.2.1. Pro: The UK will have to strike deals with both the EU and third countries, which will require it to make concessions. It will probably have to accept, to some extent, the laws of the EU, especially if it wants to trade. It may even have to accept some regulatory alignment with third countries. The ability to choose not to be subjected to those rules is limited by the power the UK has vis-à-vis other countries. The UK may have less power on its own than as part of the EU.
1.8.7.2.2. Pro: The US food industry has already proposed bringing chlorinated, contaminated chicken into the UK. It’s going to be far more likely that the government [will accept lowered food standards from third countries](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/26/uk-us-trade-deal-chlorinated-chicken-michael-gove-liam-fox?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) for the bump in GDP that results from the trade. Without the EU to trade with and the protections and standards they provide, it’s going to be tempting to sacrifice a bit of public health for the cash offered by a powerful US food lobby.
1.8.7.2.3. Pro: Multinational companies will be able to exert leverage on UK employment law by threatening to move jobs out of the UK, whereas they would be less able to use this negotiating tactic to influence EU-wide employment laws.
1.8.7.2.4. Con: Any marginal increase in external lobbying represents less of a problematic influence than that of the EU's direct sovereignty over UK institutions.
1.8.7.2.4.1. Pro: External lobbying only attempts to influence the UK, and does not have direct authority to mandate a change to UK law. Thus, the influence of lobbying is more easily resisted and less of a significant threat to sovereignty.
1.8.7.2.4.1.1. Con: Evidence from the [US](http://www.businesspundit.com/10-of-the-biggest-lobbies-in-washington/) indicates that lobbying groups can have a very strong influence on laws and government spending.
1.8.7.2.5. Pro: Some prospective trading partners prefer arbitration of agreements/treaties pertaining to trade to be conducted by [industry panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement), not courts. This not only reduces transparency and therefore accountability, it also allows foreign private companies to sue the government for changing laws that they deem to be detrimental to their profits/competitiveness.
1.8.7.2.6. Pro: The UK government will still want to influence EU laws and regulations, but will do that by lobbying. This occurs mostly behind closed doors, and is therefore less transparent and accountable than having UK citizens in the European Parliament, and in various other positions in the EU.
1.8.7.3. Pro: It is politically naive to suggest that any country enjoys "full" sovereignty. All countries across the world sacrifice or pool sovereignty when they enter into trade treaties or international institutions, such as NATO, as those treaty obligations override domestic law. What is being asked for here is not achievable and not desirable.
1.8.8. Con: This aim is unlikely to be achieved as new trade deals bring in new regulations. Examples include American patent law and ability for coporates to sue governments.
1.8.9. Con: The extra layer of jurisdiction means that UK citizens can appeal to a higher court if they feel domestic law does not implement the rights of citizens that are described in EU law correctly, such as [equal pay](http://www.equalpayportal.co.uk/the-law/).
1.8.9.1. Con: The ECJ takes a purposive approach to interpreting EU regulation that expands its authority rather than respecting member states' sovereignty [\(Alter, p. 656\)](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3083&context=faculty_scholarship).
1.8.10. Pro: The EU consists of member states that often have conflicting interests with clear winners and losers in any given piece of legislation, regulation, etc. It is better for nation states to control their own destinies.
1.8.10.1. Con: EU legislation undergoes fierce bargaining and is a result of compromise more often than not. In most cases member states ask for something in return in order to agree with some legislation.
1.8.10.2. Con: Decision making on a clearly national basis wouldn't avoid competition between national interests, and would facilitate zero sum situations as bigger nations would have no institutional checks on their power. This would only deprive EU nations of the platform and means to negotiate their differences in a peacefull, effective and mutually beneficial way.
1.8.10.3. Con: No nation state controls its own destiny in an[intensely globalized](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/trump-tariff-europe/555146/) world. [Giant players on the global stage](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/15/these-25-companies-are-more-powerful-than-many-countries-multinational-corporate-wealth-power/) \(e.g. Exxon-Mobil, Microsoft, General Electric\), [manipulate national politics](http://www.transparency.org.uk/our-work/uk-corruption/lobbying/#.WrVYhpdpHtQ), preferring smaller, weaker states \(less likely to regulate and tax them\). The British electorate's interests are low priority for them, as opinions are easily manipulated via the popular press. Multilateral Organisations allow national governments to collaborate and retain power to act in the people's interests.
1.8.10.4. Con: Inside or outside of the EU, Britain is still beholden to the same tides of international politics and economics \(which are outside of the control of any one state\) that drive the rules and policies of individual states. As an EU member, Britain wields far more power and authority to deal with trans-national players \(e.g. corporations and their lobbyists, rebel groups, cross-border rogue states etc\) and navigate these tides than if it stands alone.
1.8.10.4.1. Pro: No trade agreement exists that does not have an arbitrator that forces changes of laws in the participating countries. Even falling back to World Trade Organisation would mean other countries have effects on our laws.
1.8.10.4.1.1. Con: MPs could hold the outcomes of the deal to account and have repealed it if it was unpopular. Within the EU, they cannot.
1.8.10.5. Pro: Even big corporations are bound by law, wether it be national or international, thus ways remain to limit their capacity for interference in national politics.
1.8.10.6. Pro: The EU itself lacks transparency and is very much affected by [lobbying](https://lobbyfacts.eu/charts-graphs) from big corporations. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is even less control from the people in this instance than there would be were the national state the only institution to be considered, in the absence of the EU.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.
1.10. Con: The institutions of the EU are not representative of modern Britain.
1.10.1. Pro: The bureaucratic and elected institutions of the EU [demonstrate a distinct lack of ethnic diversity](https://www.dawn.com/news/1388420), particularly when UK-originating MEPs/employees are excluded. The UK should not be part of an institution which lacks diversity to this extent.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Currently only [5% of the MEPs are from ethnic minorities](https://www.europeaninterest.eu/article/meet-national-racial-minorities-new-european-parliament/) \(despite these people making up 10% of the total population\), and a fifth of these \(around 7 MEPs\) are from the UK.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: In the last European parliament only 1.6% of MEPs were from ethnic minorities. Now it's 5%. That's a 312% improvement in representation in one election cycle.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Six out of the seven different 'Presidents' of the EU are all [white and male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_institutions_of_the_European_Union).
1.10.1.2.1. Con: This is not an EU issue, the EU is relatively young, compare the EU to other diplomatic organisations. Britain has had no prime ministers of colour and only two women in it's history.
1.10.1.2.1.1. Pro: [The UK has only had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom#Since_1721) 2 \(out of 75\) female prime ministers since 1721. \(Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May\).
1.10.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Over the last 40 years, the UK has had a female prime minister for [13 of those years](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom), which is over 30% of the time. The EU has had female Presidents for zero of those years.
1.10.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The UK has had a series of incredibly well respected and powerful queens who ruled as head of state since [1558](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England).
1.10.1.2.1.2. Pro: The UK has only had white prime ministers.
1.10.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The UK had its first ethnic minority Prime Minister and first person from an ethnic minority background to hold one of the Great Offices of State in [1868](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli).
1.10.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.1.2.1.1.1.
1.10.1.3. Pro: The EU has been [accused of being blind to](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/eu-criticised-leaving-out-ethnic-minorities-diversity-drive) [ethnic minorities](https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-blind-to-diversity-whiteout-european-parliament/).
1.10.1.4. Con: This is a global problem that is not unique to these institutions, and therefore not a reason to leave the EU.
1.10.1.4.1. Con: The EU bureaucracy is a particularly bad example, which is paying lip service to the problem while continuing in the same worrying vein [favouring white men over woman and ethnic minorities for positions of real power](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-european-commission-gender-equality-6-men-no-women-promoted-to-top-eurocrat-grade/).  As the unelected bureaucratic body which in some respects wields more power than the UK parliament,  we should not accept its power until it has genuinely reformed.
1.10.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.2.
1.10.1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4. Con: The best way to influence change in the organisation is by being a member.
1.10.1.4.1.4.1. Con: David Cameron already tried proposing changes and [failed to extract meaningful concessions](https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2017/02/camerons-renegotiation-took-place-a-year-ago-heres-our-take-on-it-from-the-time.html).
1.10.1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: Mr Cameron secured the [“emergency brake/Red Card”](https://brexit853.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/powers-that-the-uk-has-failed-to-use-to-control-eu-freedom-of-movement-directive/) mechanism which allowed any EU country whose welfare system has come under strain, as the result of an influx of EU migrants of ‘an exceptional magnitude’, to restrict access to certain kinds of welfare benefits.
1.10.1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: It was recognised that the United Kingdom was [exempt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105) to further political integration into the European Union.
1.10.1.4.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Britain will have significantly less influence in Europe if it leaves the EU, and as a result will be a weaker nation in the international community.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Influence is complex and multifactorial, and therefore challenging to predict. The view that the UK's post-Brexit future influence will wane may therefore reflect cognitive bias.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Given the size of the UK economy, the EU may be forced to respond to unilateral decisions taken by the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The EU has [threatened to sanction](https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/3017883/uk-to-develop-distinct-regulatory-framework-post-brexit) the UK if it liberalises its economy post-Brexit, illustrating they fear the power and influence the UK will have post-Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The idea to treat a country that aims to become "an uncooperative tax haven" as "an uncooperative tax jurisdiction" seems a pragmatic, rather than fearful, response.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: Unshackled by the EU's protectionist rules, the UK could lead by example with economic and trade liberalisation, providing a [beacon to economic growth](https://www.economistsforfreetrade.com/News/brexit-could-boost-uk-economy-by-135-billion-say-top-economists/) that the EU could follow should they wish to replicate our success.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Agreements reached between the UK and other countries may directly influence EU policy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.3. Con: As a member of the EU the UK has a veto in many important areas of policy, and a vote in many more. It's nonsensical to suggest that losing veto power can add influence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.1.4. Con: Many things are complex and multifactorial and challenging to predict. This doesn't mean you can't take a measured view on them. It seems highly likely that wielding less economic power post-Brexit will result in wielding less influence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2. Pro: The UK owns a market composed of 65 million people; the USA owns a market composed of 300 million people; the EU owns a market composed of 500 million people; China owns a market composed of 1 billion people: the larger your market is, the more powerful you are. Outside the EU, the UK will lose its bargaining power.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Economy size is only one metric of how much other countries want to trade with you. The other important metric is ease of doing business.  The UK together with the US are the [only G7 countries that make the top 10 list](http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/~/media/WBG/DoingBusiness/Documents/Annual-Reports/English/DB18-Chapters/DB18-Overview.pdf), indicating how desirable the UK economy is and how much other countries will want to do business with us. Germany only ranks 20th, France 31st and Italy 46th. The UK is both very big and a very easy place to do business.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Of course it is, but think about losing all the facilities that the EU offers to the UK \(for example, [two european agencies](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/relocation-london-agencies-brexit/)\), and also think about all the cuts prepared by the English government. We can't be sure the UK will keep being a good place to do business.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: It is the UK and not the EU that has made the UK a good place to do business, therefore fear mongering about what a future UK government may do outside of the EU is misguided.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Brexit is making the UK a less good place to do [business](https://www.verdict.co.uk/which-companies-could-leave-the-uk-because-of-brexit/).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.16.8.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.1.3. Con: The UK already does business with plenty of other countries under the existing EU arrangements. It is not clear that the desirablity of the UK for external trade will increase as a result of Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.2.2. Con: Value and currency strength are also relevant to an assessment of a market. So one million UK citizens are worth far more than one million Chinese citizens in market terms.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3. Con: Britain's soft-power and diplomatic relations with the Commonwealth, the Anglosphere and many other nations outside the EU make it if not the pre-eminent global soft-power, then a close second or third.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: A [report](https://softpower30.com) by Portland, a communications strategy firm working for governments and large corporations, currently ranks the UK as the nation with the most soft power in the world. This makes the UK well placed to weather the transition, and suggests a hard Brexit would not meaningfully affect its influence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.2. Con: The Commonwealth has been shown to be an extremely weak institution, thus it does not grant the UK much 'softpower'.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: The [Commonwealth Charter](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter) aims to stop discrimination of all kinds, however Homosexuality remains a criminal offence in [35 of 53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations#United_Kingdom) Commonwealth states.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Several Commonwealth and former Commonwealth members have broken the [Harare Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare_Declaration), despite the Commonwealth's objections. \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations#Membership)\]
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.2.3. Pro: The commonwealth is comprised of 52 member states, none of which have any greater decision-making power than the other. This hinders Britain's ability to impose its political will on those nations.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.3. Con: The Anglosphere is currently pursuing a diverse range of political directions and agendas. It is unlikely that the UK can significantly direct individual countries, let alone the group as a whole.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.4. Pro: Leaving the EU would mean the UK probably could not go back if Brexit was a total disaster. Remaining would mean the UK could still leave if membership proved to get worse in the future. The best option is to stay and use veto to agitate for change and improve the EU as a full, key member.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.5. Con: The UK's negotiating position in the EU will likely be extremely poor. Cancellation of Article 50 will not make everyone forget about the whole affair.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.6. Pro: The UK will have less value to the US as it will no longer be its [window](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/20/brexit-european-union-united-states-europe/85976276/) to the European Union.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7. Con: Britain's foreign policy focus on Europe crowds out its ability to pursue partnerships with the [commonwealth](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/769151/Commonwealth-rebirth-Brexit-Britain-shun-EU-Queen-countries-Article-50-trade).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.1. Con: The commonwealth is a far less politically influential actor to be allied with than the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.1.1. Pro: The combined GDP of the Commonwealth is only [$10,923 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Commonwealth_of_Nations_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)), compared to the EU's GDP of [$18,800 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union). The latter is clearly the far stronger power.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.1.2. Con: The commonwealth as a group is not, but individual countries in it are — Australia, Canada, India, South Africa, etc.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.2. Con: The commonwealth is currently far less unified than the EU, making joint decisions on foreign policy far more difficult.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.3.2.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.2.2. Con: Because it’s not the same goal. Precisely what is criticized in the EU is the amount of control and influence it has on national politics.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.3. Con: The UK already holds significant political influence with commonwealth states.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.3.1. Con: The UK has come under criticism by Commonwealth nations in recent years due to its imperialist legacy, with prominent political parties in South Africa [boycotting](https://buzzsouthafrica.com/blacks-are-illiterates-unemployed-and-dying-because-of-whites/) Commonwealth conferences and traditions such as the Commonwealth games coming under [attack](http://allafrica.com/stories/201611240193.html). The political atmosphere makes future cooperation more difficult.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.3.2. Pro: The commonwealth's [headquarters](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16842428) are in London.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.3.3. Pro: Of the commonwealth member states, Britain [provides](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/02/commonwealth-global-britain-sounds-nostalgia-something-else) the most funds.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.4. Pro: The combined population of the commonwealth is [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) than that of the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.5. Con: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.16.6.1.1.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.6. Con: In the status quo, Britain acts as a voice for the Commonwealth countries' interests within the EU. Commonwealth states in the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group \(ACP\) benefit particularly from this arrangement, which has [led](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-commonwealth-a-dormant-giant-looks-towards-the-post-brexit-future-1.672397) to beneficial trade deals with the EU as a whole based on their historic association with Britain. Brexit robs these countries of their primary advocate in the bloc.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.7. Con: The Caribbean nations depend heavily on tariff-free trade with Britain under the Economic Partnership Agreement. A hard Brexit would leave [little time](http://www.ramphalinstitute.org/uploads/2/3/9/9/23993131/caribbean_hangover.pdf) to renegotiate this, harming British-Caribbean relations.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.7.1. Con: If it's an agreement already in place with the EU then they have the opportunity to agree it continues as it currently exists with the UK on a bilateral basis until something new is negotiated.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.3.1.2.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.9. Pro: A hard Brexit will adversely affect the interests of countries outside of Europe, leading to a fall in Britain's standing within the international community.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.9.1. Pro: The possibility of a hard Brexit has already thrown a trade deal with African states into question, adversely affecting [Kenya's flower exports](https://www.ft.com/content/01beeb54-5347-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef) to the EU, a major part of its economy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.7.7.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10. Pro: Having a large say in the EU has allowed the UK to shape the policy interests of a larger and more powerful entity, giving Britain more influence on the international stage. Withdrawing from this position would likely reverse these effects, reducing British influence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10.1. Con: The UKs influence is derived as much from our global 'soft power' and alliance with the United States as anything else. The UK's ability to project hard power comes from its status as a nuclear power. The UK's status as a 'bridge' between the US and EU is much overhyped - witness the recent trade dispute of which the UK is merely a bystander. Freed from the EU, the UK can critique the EUs tendency to exploit its trade power with the global south.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10.2. Pro: Baroness Ashton, a British Labour peer, was the first [High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy#Catherine_Ashton_\(2009%E2%80%9314\)), the most senior foreign affairs official in the EU following the Treaty of Lisbon.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10.3. Pro: Not having a say within the EU could reduce the UK's leverage with Washington. The US [currently](http://www.cer.eu/insights/impact-brexit-eu) sees the UK as a bridge between themselves and continental Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10.4. Pro: While within the EU, Britain has sizable representation in the European parliament \([73 seats](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/your-meps/european_elections.html)\), as well as throughout all EU institutions.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10.5. Pro: EU membership has enabled Britain to pursue critical foreign policy objectives as part of a more formidable bloc, such as confronting Russia over its actions in Ukraine or addressing the Iran nuclear program.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.10.5.1. Pro: Britain has been the most vocal supporter within the EU of sanctions against Russia, [according](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/26/brexit-is-good-news-for-russia-but-a-headache-for-nato/) to Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.11. Con: The EU has shaped British foreign policy more than Britain has shaped European foreign policy. Speaking with an independent voice will give the UK the ability to lead by example and forge new partnerships rather than continually compromise with other EU countries.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.11.1. Pro: The [Common Foreign and Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy) is the organised foreign policy of the EU. Decisions require unanimity in the European Council, however once agreed aspects of the policy can be decided by qualified majority voting which ultimately means that Britain does not exercise complete control over its foreign policy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.13.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.11.3. Con: As a member of the EU, Britain has always tried to adopt a [foreign policy](http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/72665) that would ensure a balance of power in continental Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.12. Con: Britain is still in NATO, giving it many forums and connections for security policy coordination.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.12.1. Con: As a result of Brexit, the UK is at risk of losing its [most senior held position](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-uk-lose-most-senior-nato-military-position-eu-european-union-deputy-supreme-a7519196.html) in NATO.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.12.2. Pro: Because Brexit means that the UK will no longer have to support EU military endeavors, they will have [more](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/25/europes-loss-is-natos-gain/) martial resources to deploy in the service of NATO. This additional support ensures that Britain remains able to access NATO resources and maintain its standing outside the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.12.2.1. Con: More martial resources for NATO comes at the expense of the EU's defence, making this a zero sum game. Other EU countries may have to redirect efforts away from NATO to shore up holes left by the British.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.12.3. Con: The Trump Administration has consistently [expressed doubts](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2017/12/trump_went_back_to_nato_bashing_in_pensacola_speech.html) about the future of the alliance, making it an unreliable plan for British security moving forward.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.12.3.1. Con: Despite recent rhetorical grandstanding, the United States has taken [concrete steps](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/29/trumps-shadow-hangs-over-nato-transatlantic-alliance-europe-defense-deterrence-europe-mattis-jens-stoltenberg/) to continue to support the alliance.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13. Con: Remaining in the EU would harm our democracy and humiliate the UK on the world stage.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.1. Con: Remaining could correspond to the democratic will \(expressed through a vote, through parliament, …\)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.2. Con: Leaving in a way which is harmful to the UK may do even more damage to the UK's reputation.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.3. Con: Both remaining or leaving might harm democracy, and the UK is already humiliated by an incompetent negotiating team. Concerning 'humiliation on the world stage', What could be more humiliating for 'The Mother of Parliaments' and 'The home of Democracy', than the spectacle of an undemocratic government railroading through a decision that the population now probably regrets but will have been denied the democratic right to recant/confirm a possible 'No deal', bail out without a parachute. [Poll](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-poll-voters-eu-leave-wrong-theresa-may-negotiations-deal-yougov-a8383826.html)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4. Pro: The British public voted to leave the EU. Democratic will requires that the outcome of the referendum must be respected, thus the UK must leave the EU regardless of the deal secured.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1. Pro: Remaining in the EU would undermine the UK citizens' faith in democracy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.1. Con: If a decision to remain in the EU was framed as an acknowledgment that the promises made by the leave side in the referendum campaign were entirely unachievable, and that therefore to remain is "the best possible deal", this could reinforce or strengthen democracy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2. Pro: The Remain voters tended to come from the "[elite classes](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/)" with higher levels of education or held professional/managerial roles. Choosing to remain could be seen as the popular will being overcome by the wishes of the elite.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.1. Con: The key figures behind the Leave campaign \(politicans, donors and media owners\) are all very wealthy and could well be argued are part of the "elite".
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Members of the elite establishment were present on both sides of the debate. That does not change that fact that Remain voters were more likely to have [gone to university](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/30/facts-support-mps-claim-that-better-educated-voted-remain-pollster), and were [on average wealthier](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/brexit-voters-are-not-thick-not-racist-just-poor/).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.2. Con: Whilst yes the ABs \([The "Elite" classes](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/)\) were the only social group to have a remain majority \(57%\), a much more decisive predictor of wishing to remain was age. 73% of 18-24s, 62% of 25-34s and 52% of 35-45s.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.3. Con: The pro-Brexit campaign was heavily support by wealthy individuals, largely being [funded](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-leave-eu-campaign-arron-banks-jeremy-hosking-five-uk-richest-businessmen-peter-hargreaves-a7699046.html) by five of the UK's wealthiest business men. Nigel Farage, perhaps the most prominent Leave voice, is [personally very wealthy](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/16/nigel-farage-skint-ukip-4m-townhouse).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.4. Con: So called ''elite classes'', by nature of their higher level of education, would be more likely to be properly informed on issues.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.2.5. Con: Most of those [working voted Remain](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-2016-eu-referendum).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.3. Pro: A majority of voters who did not vote in the 2015 election voted in the Brexit referendum. 60% of this group voted leave. A decision to not leave the European Union may disenfranchise these new voters \(Swales K., 2016, [pg. 19](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NatCen_Brexplanations-report-FINAL-WEB2.pdf)\)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.3.1. Con: These people can vote for a Brexit party at the next election if they want. They are not disenfranchised.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.3.2. Con: That these people have never voted for or against a representative suggests perhaps that they do not understand the principles of representative democracy, in which case they clearly did not understand the nature of the referendum which was consultative, irrespective of what David Cameron \(UK Prime Minister during the referendum campaign\) might [claim](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-legally-binding-brexit-lisbon-cameron-sovereign-parliament).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.4. Con: Data suggests there is popular [support](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/26/britons-favour-second-referendum-brexit-icm-poll) for a second referendum once the Brexit terms are revealed.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.4.1. Pro: In 2015, Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings admitted before the referendum that defining Brexit would lose votes and that even Eurosceptic MPs could not agree on what Brexit should entail. He [proposed](https://dominiccummings.com/2015/06/23/on-the-referendum-6-exit-plans-and-a-second-referendum/) a referendum on the final deal himself to gain public consensus.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.4.2. Pro: A second referendum or a Brexit-focused vote, specifically on the deal the UK ends up with, possibly with an option to stay, would not necessarily undermine the will of the people. It may in fact strengthen it. It can be explained as a further exercise of democracy, and if so explained, not undermine citizens' belief in democracy at all.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.4.3. Pro: Even Nigel Farage has come out in [support](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/01/11/nigel-farage-suggests-uk-may-need-second-brexit-referendum-settle/) of a second referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.5. Con: Part of the argument for leaving is that Parliament should be sovereign. Parliament is a democratically elected body. If Parliament decides that hard Brexit is not in the best interests of the UK, then this would be a democratic action.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.5.1. Con: This would be an undemocratic decision as parliament would not be representative of the people's vote in the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.5.1.1. Con: Our democracy is based on representation, and the duty of MPs is to [vote with their conscience](https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1108699600016297985?s=19).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6. Con: Only a minority of those who were eligible to vote [voted](https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-leave-remain-52-48-per-cent-voter-turnout-electoral-register-charts-7399226) to leave.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that those who did not vote would have voted in a different proportion to those who did vote.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6.2. Con: A much smaller minority of those who were eligible to vote voted to stay.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6.2.1. Con: A bit under two percent is not much smaller.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6.2.1.1. Con: 1.3 million more people is much bigger.  This is about equivalent to the entire population of Estonia, and bigger than the entire populations of [3 other](http://www.worldometers.info/population/countries-in-the-eu-by-population/) EU states.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6.3. Pro: The British 'public' did not vote Leave. The British 'public' far outnumber those in The electorate who voted Leave, but are still profoundly affected by the government's decision to do so. Leave only achieved 3.78% majority of the electorate, not the public.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.6.4. Con: This is juggling with numbers. The rules of the referendum were clear. With the amount of media attention the referendum got there was no way that anyone could not know about this event and its rules.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7. Con: Many people were denied a vote in the referendum; this was profoundly undemocratic.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.1. Con: Democracy does not mean that every man and his dog are eligible to vote. Rules and regulations on voting eligibility are necessary in a democracy to prevent abuse.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.1.1. Con: Rules disqualifying the people most affected by the decision from voting in it were not necessary to prevent abuse. They were, instead, effectively a form of voter suppression - forcing the people most hurt by the decision to have no say in it. Nor is there any evidence that restricting voting eligibility is 'necessary to prevent abuse' - on the contrary, the most common form of abuse in some democracies is abusive rules intended to prevent voting.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.2. Pro: Approximately 1.5 million young people \(16-17\), who polled overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU, were [not allowed](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/eu-referendum-uk-result-students-votes-at-16-remain-brexit-leave-a7101821.html) to vote.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.2.1. Con: Under 18’s can also not vote in UK General Elections, Local Elections, or European elections so it is disingenuous to say they were ‘not allowed’ implying that this is exceptional.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.2.2. Con: Even if those 16 or over could vote, an overwhelming majority would have to vote remain and not abstain in order to overrule leave votes. 16-17 year olds made up [Roughly 1,428,000](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/jn5p/lms) of the voting population at the time. [89% of Scottish 16-17 year olds](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Votes-at-16-briefing.pdf) registered to vote in the Scottish referendum, and [84.6% of those actually voted](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/179807/Scottish-referendum-Public-Opinion-survey-ICM-Report-WEBSITE.pdf), which totals 75.3% of 16-17 year olds. Assuming similar proportions in the EU vote, only 1,075,198 votes would have been cast. This is not enough to change the outcome.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.3. Pro: More than 1 million Britons, who had been living in Europe for over 15 years, were [denied a vote](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/21/britons-abroad-denied-uk-general-election-vote-tories) in the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.4. Pro: Approximately 1.5 million Europeans working in the UK were [denied a vote](https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-a-list-of-all-the-people-who-can-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-and-those-who-cant--x1ZGMHAFWW).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.5. Pro: Nationals of most EU states, who pay tax and can vote in some other elections, were [not allowed](https://theconversation.com/who-can-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-57694) to vote in the EU referendum. They should have been allowed to vote.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.5.1. Con: Paying taxes is not a prerequisite for voting eligibility. If it were then very poor people, for example, may be excluded. It is not unreasonable to limit voting on matters of state to people who have fealty to said state.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.5.2. Con: Everyone who is eligible to vote in UK general elections was eligible to vote in the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.5.3. Con: Britain is actually much more liberal on voting rights than many other countries, and so by international standards EU citizens should NOT have been allowed to vote. For example, only Irish citizens can vote in Irish referendums. Germany does not allow [any non-German EU citizens to vote](https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-ballot-box-closed-to-78-million-residents/a-40359141) in general elections, even if resident in Germany for decades.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.5.4. Con: Every visitor to the UK who buys something pays tax in the form of VAT. Paying UK taxes does not entitle nationals of 3rd countries to vote.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.8. Con: The referendum was [advisory only](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-eu-referendum-not-legally-binding-supreme-court-legal-challenge-article-50-a7418706.html). It fundamentally undermines UK democracy to change the nature of the vote from advisory to binding after the results are in.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.8.1. Con: Parliament voted to implement the decision by triggering Art. 50 by an [overwhelming majority](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38833883).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.9. Con: Implementing a Brexit that does not meet the promises made by Leave politicians or fulfill the expections of Brexiteers will undermine the UK citizens faith in democracy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10. Pro: The turnout for the Brexit Referendum was higher than that of any [general election](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm) since 1997 \([at 72.2%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results)\)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.1. Con: Only 27% of UK residents [voted](https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-leave-remain-52-48-per-cent-voter-turnout-electoral-register-charts-7399226) to leave while millions were [denied](https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-a-list-of-all-the-people-who-can-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-and-those-who-cant--x1ZGMHAFWW) a vote in the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.1.2. Con: Even though this is true, even fewer people voted to remain. In a binary vote, anyone who chooses to abstain from the vote submits themselves to the result. You absolutely cannot protest a vote of this nature by means of abstaining. There is no third option.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.1.3. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.2.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.2. Con: General elections since 1997 are a poor basis for comparision. The circumstances and procedure were significantly different between the two, so it is inappropriate to compare the two turnout rates.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.2.1. Pro: Selecting a limited sample of voter turnout misrepresents turnout in general. Low voter turnout in general elections is a recent and potentially temporary phenomenon. [Voter turnout did not drop below 70% from 1922 to 1997 and averaged over 75% from 1945 to 1997.](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/turnout)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.2.2. Pro: Recent general elections have suffered from voter apathy caused by a lack of clear choice, which encourages turnout to be low.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.2.3. Pro: The Scottish Independence Referendum with a comparable question and situtation had a considerably higher turnout of [84.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.11. Pro: Whatever the eventual consequences of a hard Brexit would be, preserving the basic social contract that gives legitimacy to a modern democracy is almost certainly more important.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.11.1. Con: The idea of a 'social contract' is \(mostly\) that citizens have surrendered decision-making power to the government, in [exchange for a protection of their rights and security.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) Accepting the results of non-binding referenda \(with a very narrow majority\) as binding, without nuance, may undermine the objective of the social contract by not protecting the rights and security of a large portion of those citizens.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.2. Con: There was not a clear majority, only 51.89% voted Leave. There should have been at least 10% threshold to ensure a clear majority. Such a momentous change in national circumstance should not rest on such an insignificant majority.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.2.1. Con: A majority is still a majority, and other elections and general elections don't have a 10% threshold, so the referendum should not either.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.2.1.1. Con: A referendum is not an election. In an election the stronger the majority the more powerful the government. The weaker the majority, the more a government needs to consider the wider appeal of its policies.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.2.1.1.1. Con: A government with a weak majority would have to be more careful to appeal to all factions within its ruling group.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.2.1.2. Con: Constitutional change often requires a [supermajority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.3. Pro: The fact that Brexit negotiations have been so difficult has further [convinced](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/14/brexit-eu-referendum) many Leave voters that the EU is un-democratic and impinges on British sovereignty.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.3.1. Con: Negotiations have been so difficult because the UK government did not plan enough time before triggering Article 50 to begin those negotiations.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.3.2. Con: Negotiations have [mainly](https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2018/10/01/the-tory-party-is-split-down-the-middle) been [between](https://www.politico.eu/article/steve-baker-brexit-chequers-theresa-may-tory-party-faces-catastrophic-brexit-split-says-former-minister/) [competing](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-party-split-theresa-may-chequers-brexit-steve-baker-conference-a8530126.html) factions of the Tory party, rather than with the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.3.4. Con: Increased conviction of Leavers to Leave can largely be attributed to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). Many Remainers view the failure of negiotations as increased evidence for remaining.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5. Pro: The UK not leaving the EU would, to those who voted Leave, be a strong indication that their vote in the 2016 referendum did not carry any weight. This could result in reduced voter turnout as people think their votes don't matter.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.1. Con: The public has [lost faith](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-poll-uk-public-trust-government-political-parties-bored-hope-not-hate-a8751406.html) in the democratic process however the Brexit mess plays out.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.1.1. Pro: At least part of that is because the public conflate the referendum with British democracy. It has brought that into disrepute.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: The holding of referendums is not a conventional part of British Democracy: Parliament being sovereign and thus able to hold one does not contradict that [there is no pre-determined format or voting franchise for any such vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_the_United_Kingdom). British democracy is now, as it has been, elected officials using the superior knowledge available to them to make the hard choices. Parliament giving the suspect \(the EU\) to the lynch mob was irresponsible.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.1.2. Con: Brexit is no more nor less than a total breakdown in faith in the democratic process. Whatever reasons people had for voting to leave, they all revolve in a loss of that faith: whether it is faith in the democratic processes of the EU, in our government's ability to realise our proper place in it, or voting leave because they have simply lost faith in our political system and see this as a chance to express that opinion.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2. Con: The 2016 referendum was advisory and as such did not carry any legal weight. That this point wasn't made clear and indeed promises were made that couldn't be kept that have since been exploited by populists, is unfortunate but we live in a democracy and citizens have responsibilities as well as rights, they should understand the political process and that any brexit outcome does have any bearing on the importance of their vote matters in legally constituted elections.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.1. Pro: If we have to follow through and do everything that is promised by people who don't have the authority to promise it, we'll end up in a right old mess.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.2. Con: Regardless of any moral obligation to understand, many won't.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: The lack of understanding is in some part due to [politicians](https://youtu.be/3AwKLOLB4Qg) and [newsmedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemies_of_the_People_\(headline\)) failing to accurately explain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3. Pro: Referenda are [not legally binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_the_United_Kingdom) in the United Kingdom, as it is recognised that Parliament has sovereign authority.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.8.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.2. Pro: The EU referendum was not a General Election. There is no legal precedent on implementing the "democratic will" of the referendum before the Government defines the details of its interpretation of Brexit. A Government interpretation of what Brexit means is not the "will of the people".
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.3. Con: British constitutional law is not codified and operates partially through [conventions or customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_\(political_custom\)#United_Kingdom). Respecting the outcome of a referendum is an important convention, even if not codified.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.1.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.3.2. Pro: In 1890, one of the foremost constitutional theorists, A.V. Dicey [noted](http://www.keepcalmtalklaw.co.uk/constitution--convention-whats-stopping-a-second-brexit-referendum/) that a referendum ought to be an authoritative judgment on matters of constitutional importance, and therefore accepting its result should be a powerful convention.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.3.2.1. Con: [Constitutional changes conventionally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority) require a supermajority.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.4. Pro: The referendum was legally advisory, and no supermajority was therefore required. It has only become politically binding during the referendum campaign, but this is not something that Parliament could vote for or against. If it was legally binding, Parliament might have [insisted on a supermajority](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201012/ldselect/ldconst/177/17706.htm).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.3. Con: Their votes have been valued, parliament has spent the last 3 years talking about very little else but how to enact brexit. There's been a strangely divisive approach to turning a terribly vague, ill-defined position that people voted for into a terribly unpopular and damaging set of options. This is how democracy works.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.10.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.7. Pro: Because of how [divided](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-36638528/brexit-just-how-divided-is-britain) the country is, reversing the referendum would require a level of nationwide consensus building that is unprecedented in modern history.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.7.1. Con: Unprecedented things can and do happen. That's where precedents come from.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.7.2. Con: The referendum result itself was a large factor in dividing the country - Scotland and Northern Ireland both voted to Remain \(both by a significant margin - 62% and 55.8% respectively\), but the overall result was marginal towards leave due to a small lead in England \(53.4%\) and Wales \(52.5%\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.7.2.1. Con: Reversing the referendum without an electoral mandate may well heighten, not soften, the bitterness of that divide.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.7.3. Con: Because every possible version of Brexit is opposed not just by remainers, but by [some factions of leavers](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16039526.May_risks_inflaming_Tory_infighting_with_longer_Brexit_transition/) as well, following through on the referendum would require an even-greater level of consensus-building.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.8. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9. Con: It is the primary job of any government to protect its citizens, even if that means sometimes doing things the public doesn’t like or doesn’t understand. If there are clear arguments against a hard Brexit then the UK should not leave the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.1. Pro: The implications of Brexit are very complicated and not well understood \(even by engaged citizens\), the main reason for having a representative democracy is professional politicians can make informed decisions on our behalf.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.1.1. Pro: 37% of the EU's budget was [spent](https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/cap-glance_en#howitspaidfor) on the Common Agricultural Policy in 2018. The benefits/drawbacks of the Common Agricultural Policy have never been discussed prominently and are not well understood by the general public.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.2. Pro: The introduction of referenda into a system of governance ought not negate the role of parliament as representatives, especially since all present representatives were elected after the referendum, and therefore have a more up-to-date mandate than the referendum itself.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.3. Con: "Democracy is the worst system of government, except for all the others."  What you're espousing here is some sort of oligarchy. Britain, however, is a democracy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.3.1. Con: Britain is a representative democracy, wherein \(at least in principle\) legal and political experts are elected to make complicated decisions on behalf of the people, rather than the people making all decisions directly. The EU referendum was itself advisory, to be implemented as parliament saw fit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4. Con: It is inconsistent for the government to ignore the will of the people and yet also claim it is necessary for them to rethink the whole process.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1. Con: Unless Leave voters can decide on a definitive version of Brexit they can all stand behind, there is no real "will of the people". If our Government refuses to offer Britain a vote on the best deal it can negotiate on it's own interpretation of Brexit, when according to polls more people would now vote Remain, then doesn't qualify as democratic.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1. Con: Opinion polls are notoriously unreliable as certain opinion sets are less likely to participate in polls than others.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason either Leavers or Remainers would be less likely to want to express their view.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.1.1. Con: There are [groups](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/16/poverty-election-vote-apathy) that are proportionately less likely to participate in polling and it's inevitable that they will have cross-over [correlation](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/brexit-vote-explained-poverty-low-skills-and-lack-opportunities) with the groups leaver and remainer.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.3. Pro: Response rates for telephone surveys have been [decreasing](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/), limiting further the coverage of responders.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.3.1. Con: [PEW research analysis](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2017/05/15/what-low-response-rates-mean-for-telephone-surveys/) says any bias introduced into survey data by current levels of participation is limited in scope.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Washington Post data shows little change in the accuracy of several major national surveys, despite plummeting response rates. VP of Survey group SSRS says it "[doesn't make any difference](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/polling-when-people-dont-answer-phones_n_56b3b06ee4b04f9b57d8e014?guccounter=1) compared to the olden days when only one out of five hung up on you, insofar as the people who hang up are fairly random to the people who don't hang up".
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.4. Con: Good polls use [oversampling or undersampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling_and_undersampling_in_data_analysis) to account for groups who would otherwise be under-represented.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.10. Con: The Brexit Referendum did not generate consensus, with [Scotland and Northern Ireland](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) voting to remain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.10.1. Pro: The Brexit referendum never set out to seek consensus and only very recently has the government even considered finding a consensus.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11. Con: Evidence suggests that the democratic will of the British people has changed since the EU referendum in 2016.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1. Pro: Polls indicate that public opinion now supports remaining in the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1. Pro: Academics predict based on changing demographics that the majority of people will [want to remain](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-britain-eu-stay-2021-public-opinion-society-changes-theresa-may-transition-deal-a8278146.html) either now or within years, this is due to the increase in remain votes from young educated people entering the election roll, versus old and uneducated leaving \(death\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.1. Con: The predictions of these academics will likely turn out to be false as according to notable international investors, experienced businessmen and politicians, people across all demographics [will increasingly realise from 2020 onwards](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/jul/24/two-50-or-100-years-when-do-leavers-think-brexit-will-pay-off) that they are better served by Britain not being a member of the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.1.1. Con: According to one Brexit leader, the full benefits of leaving will take [at least 50](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/jul/24/two-50-or-100-years-when-do-leavers-think-brexit-will-pay-off) years to appear. The people living in the UK for the next 50 years will therefore not realise that leaving the EU is in their interests.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2. Con: The predictions of these academics have not taken into account the probability that individual opinions on being part of the EU will change over time and as people become older, and therefore their predictions are interesting but extremely unreliable.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1. Pro: As people age [they become more right wing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics), and Conservative voters were [more likely](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/) to vote Leave than Labour voters. This was not taken into account by the academics' demography-based predictions.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1.1. Con: A person's age is not the determining factor in deciding voting preferences; the [generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation#Western_world) one grew up is important as well.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The current older generation may vote conservative due to lower education levels, which will not be the case when current young generation becomes old. Younger generations are more likely to have been to university \([35% of 30-year-olds have a degree, compared with 10% of 70-year-olds](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics)\), and [higher education tends to make people more socially liberal](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-47910). As the current young generation ages, they will therefore not be educationally equivalent/follow the same voting patterns as the current old.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The effect of aging on party affiliation as distinct from generational factors has been [known for some time](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/26/4/648/1868747?redirectedFrom=PDF).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: "It has not always been the case that younger generations are more Left-wing", according to a United States PEW Research [study](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/30/a-different-look-at-generations-and-partisanship/) showing that whilst in 2014 age correlated with right-wing voting, the opposite was true in 1994.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Studies suggest that the events that happen fairly early on in life set basic outlooks and orientations that affect how people vote for the rest of their lives. Examples from PEW, Bennington College, and Columbia University are discussed in [this article](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: A long term study tracked voting choices of several thousand people over their lifetime, and found a [0.32% - 0.38%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413000875) increase in Conservative voters per year.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.2. Pro: Older people [were more likely to vote for Brexit](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/), and if it is true that people become more likely to support Brexit as they age then the academics' predictions will be inaccurate.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.3. Pro: The population is getting older because [we are living longer](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2014to2016).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.4. Pro: Older voters are on average wiser than the youngest voters, and their views are less prone to fluctuation. As the youngest voters get wiser it is therefore reasonable to assume that a proportion of them will change their views to align more closely to the prevailing wisdom amongst older voters.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.4.1. Con: While life-experience increases with age, people's [IQ start decreasing by the age of 60](https://medium.com/psyc-406-2015/how-fast-does-iq-decline-can-you-do-anything-about-it-f5ca370d8b62), hampering good judgement and application of their knowledge.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: The decrease in some measures of IQ happens after people tend to become fixed in their political opinions. Therefore the opinions of older generations are representative of the peak of their raw IQ-based capabilities.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: A university of Texas study found that [wisdom increases with age, especially for longer term strategic decisions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/8720182/Wisdom-comes-with-age-study-shows.html) which took future stages into account. They found that younger adults were better when only the immediate rewards needed to be considered. They suggested a biological cause of younger adults using their still strong ventral striatum, compared to older people who are forced to compensate by using their prefrontal cortices as their ventral striatum degrades.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.2. Pro: A political group funded by George Soros that wants to overturn the referendum result [has alleged](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/11/more-than-100-pro-leave-constituencies-switch-to-remain) that there are more than 100 constituencies that voted for Brexit but now want to Remain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.2.1. Con: Both of the groups that funded this study have been funded by [George](http://fortune.com/2018/05/30/george-soros-best-for-britain-brexit-campaign/) [Soros](https://www.civilliberty.org.uk/newsdetail.php?newsid=2345), who has [explicitly stated](https://www.politico.eu/article/second-brexit-referendum-george-soros-campaign-about-to-start/) his intention to reverse Brexit. The bias of the funding source together with clear methodological errors renders the results unreliable.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.2.2. Con: This poll seeks to analyse all 600+ constituencies on the basis of a survey of just 15,000 people. This means an average sample size of just 25 people per constituency. The mean constituency size is [~70,000](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/constituencies/#jump-link-0), which means the margin of error for each constituency of [20%](http://www.comresglobal.com/our-work/margin-of-error-calculator/). Given the difference between Leave and Remain is far less than this in most constituencies, the headline result of this polling data of 100 constituencies switching is, statistically speaking, invalid.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.3. Con: Current polls show at most a few percent more votes for remaining in the EU. As Polls are not fully reliable especially by one or two percentage points, they currently only show that public opinion is still pretty evenly split.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.4. Con: [YouGov polling](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2018/03/29/where-britain-stands-brexit-one-year-out/) found that while slightly more people now think Brexit was the wrong decision, a majority of people still think they should continue with Brexit in some form \(a softer Brexit\), with only 13% saying Brexit should be abandoned completely.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.5. Pro: Combining all early 2018 polls gives an average \(once the Don’t Knows are left to one side\) of 48.5% for leave, and 51.5% for remain, according to [whatUKThinks.org](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/two-years-on-many-a-doubt-but-few-changed-minds/).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.1.6. Con: The majority of polls before the EU referendum also [suggested](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/eu-referendum-how-right-or-wrong-were-the-polls/) the UK would vote to stay in the EU. There is no evidence that the polling methodology is now more accurate on this question. Polls are therefore not a reliable indicator of voting behaviour on this issue.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.2. Pro: Young voters who were not eligible to vote during the 2016 referendum but are eligible now [overwhelmingly support](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/09/new-young-voters-want-peoples-vote-strongly-remain-survey) Remain. Carrying on without their consent would be undemocratic.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.1.7.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3. Pro: In democracies, voters should be able to [change](http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-mp-delivers-speech-on-the-opportunities-for-a-referendum-on-europe/) their mind if new information comes to light.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.1. Pro: It is not logical to stick to a decision without any reassessment of that decision if the situation changes. This is analogous to driving, where if you choose to turn right, then see a wall, but carry on going because the decision has been made. As negotiations have progressed, and the reality of the impact has begun to emerge, maybe we can now see the wall in front of us. This should at least mean that there is an opportunity to decide again.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.1.1. Con: The negative speculation about what might happen if x or y is merely a continuation of what started before the referendum with the same motivations. The lack of accuracy in past forecasting demonstrates that we'll not know how the economy will be affected until after the verdict of the first vote has been properly implemented.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.2. Con: While a democracy is free to change its mind, officials should not have referendum after referendum until they get the results that they want.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.2.1. Con: This is irrelevant to the proposition. The proposition is about which outcome is preferable, not which means of decision making. The proposition is, for instance, compatible with the stance that the House of Commons should vote to revoke article 50 without a referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.2.2. Con: Results of referenda are not random. It is determined by the will of people. Therefore people can keep voting the same way unless something changed their mind.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.2.2.1. Con: "[Voter fatigue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268016303263)" is a known phenomenon that occurs when people are asked to vote too often, their resolutions are not implemented, or they are otherwise disengaged. Even if a second referendum were won by remain, that may not indicate that minds were changed so much as that leave voters got disheartened and gave up on expressing an opinion that they see the political establishment as ignoring.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.2.2.2. Pro: Public opinion has [remained split](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/), within the margin of error of the previous result.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.3. Pro: The consensus at time of referendum was mildly in favour of Brexit. Current polling suggests the public are [mildly in favour of remaining.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum) Democratic will is based on a country's public's current preferences, not on their past preferences.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.3.1. Con: Polling at the time of the referendum suggested that too. It was wrong.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.3.2. Con: The previous referendum was held in 1975, meaning that democratic will was based on past preferences for 41 years. It hasn't even been 4 years since June 2016.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.3.2.1. Con: There could have been a referendum at any point during that time.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.11.3.3.2.2. Con: The need for further voting should be based on a change in public opinion, not on any arbitrary length of time.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12. Con: The EU referendum was not carried out in the spirit of open and fair democracy, which means that the result is unlikely to be a true reflection of democratic will.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1. Pro: Various Leave campaign groups broke electoral law during the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.1. Pro: Vote Leave have been proven to have [broken the law.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44856992)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.2. Pro: Leave.EU was fined [£70,000](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/brexit-vote-leave-electoral-law-commission-criminal-investigation-charges-police-delay-a8609226.html) by the Electoral Commission for incorrectly reporting what it spent at the EU referendum, founder of BeLeave was fined £20,000 for criminal offences, and investigations by the metropolitan police and the National Crime Agency are ongoing against Vote Leave.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.3. Pro: Groups such as the [UK in EU Challenge](https://www.ukineuchallenge.com/) claimed that these actions were "enough to declare the Referendum result null and void".
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.3.1. Con: The court of appeals found that the law that would enable the recall of a vote due to wrongdoing \(Representation of the People Act 1983\) [does not apply](https://www.ukineuchallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/272204-Judgment-Court-of-Appeal.pdf) because the referendum was non-binding.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.3.1.1. Pro: Then the result can be declared null and void without needing any further governance.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.4. Con: [Remain spent £19 million, Leave £13 million](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/political-parties-campaigning-and-donations/campaign-spending-and-donations-at-referendums/campaign-spending-at-the-eu-referendum). It is unrealistic to suggest that Leave won because they ineligibly spent more money.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.1.4.1. Pro: The Government sent their their remain mailout just before the official campaign start and so the electoral commission statistics do not even include that [£9 million](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35980571). This alone covers more than the total Vote.Leave spend, and over ten times greater than the amount they spent through BeLeave and were fined for.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2. Pro: There were a [number of lies](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/eu-referendum-claims-won-brexit-fact-checked/) told by the leave campaign. This means people may have made the decision to leave on incomplete or incorrect information.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.1. Pro: Vote Leave said "[The UK has been outvoted every single time it has voted against EU laws](http://view.publitas.com/15010/164151/pdfs/9b3d7fac7290257c2e72c7784537315b9351806e.pdf)" but this is untrue - UK ministers were on the losing side [only 2% of the time](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-facts-behind-claims-uk-influence/).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.2. Pro: For years before the referendum lies and anti-EU propaganda had been swallowed by a large proportion of the British public. Most 'myths' were blatantly wrong. [Check them all out here.](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.3. Con: Lies have been part and parcel of electoral politics since it existed. It is the responsibility of people to verify the information they base their votes on.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.4. Con: People can choose to vote even when they have no information, let alone incomplete information. Democracy allows them to make that choice.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.4.1. Con: Although those who are born in the UK are not required to take the test, the government sets out a [minimum level of knowledge and understanding](https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk/the-uk-government-the-law-and-your-role/) required of those claiming citizenship. People who don't have that level of understanding can still choose to vote but to do so is morally irresponsible.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5. Con: Lies were told on both sides, for example few of the [dire economic predictions](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund) of the effect of a leave vote have materialised.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.1. Con: The predictions of immediate impact were built around several assumptions on the actions of the government and institutions such as the Bank Of England.  For example, the BoE [cut interest rates](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36976528) and offered banks [an extra £250m to borrow.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37386629) These plans were [somewhat mysterious](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/05/bank-of-england-brexit-preparations-uk-banks) so couldn't have been accounted for in any forecasting.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.1.1. Con: It was obvious that the Bank of England would have taken some precautionary measures were the referendum to result in a Yes vote; at no point did the remain campaign claim that their disastrous economic predictions would only come to fruition if the Bank of England did nothing at all.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.2. Con: The predictions of immediate impact also would have assumed that the Prime Minister would have triggered Article 50 immediately, based on [his answers when directly asked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW1zZ4EufkE)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.3. Pro: Confirmation bias means that those on the remain side focus disproportionately on the inaccuracies of the leave side and assume they had more influence than is supported by any actual evidence. At the same time, they ignore the inaccuracies in the arguments of their own side.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.4. Con: Leave claimed that Brexit would result in increased prosperity. Remain claimed that Brexit would cause economic harm. With our GDP growth already down 2.1%, and forecast to go down 8% in total over the next 15 years in the event of a hard Brexit, it is clear that as far as the economy is concerned, Remain were [far more](https://www.ft.com/content/b3d35136-0543-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5) accurate.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.5. Con: There is a big difference between lies and predictions. Lies were told to intentionally mislead the electorate in able to win votes. It could be argued that predictions were based on us leaving the EU and the Single Market. Neither has occurred yet.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.6. Con: A new government study shows that the UK will be [worse off](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46366162) under Brexit in any form than staying in the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.7. Con: The UK has not left the EU yet \(as of 12th Feb 2018\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.5.8. Con: The effects of leaving will only materialise when we leave. This has not happened yet therefore the assertion that lies were told on both sides is incorrect
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.12.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.4.7.8.4.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13. Con: Even though the UK voted to leave the EU, it is unclear what the democratic will is with regards to how this is done.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.1. Con: When the British people decided by referendum on 23 June 2016 to leave the EU, the decision was not conditional on "hard" or "easy" Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.1.1. Con: The British people did not *decide* to leave the EU, they merely suggested it, in the certain knowledge that Parliament has a clear duty to consider all the relevant facts and then make the decision themselves...
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.1.2. Con: This very statement accepts and proves that what is currently on offer / happening in the Brexit process could not have been foreseen by the general public, and as such should be put to another vote.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.1.3. Con: The option for what kind of Brexit people wanted was not given as an option on the ballot. Neither was the option for "Leave the EU, the single market, Euroatom and the Bill of human rights" but that all seems to have been inferred.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2. Pro: The "instructions" from the electorate were far from specific, that is the central problem the UK finds itself dealing with - there is and never was any clear understanding of what version of leave to pursue.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1. Pro: The WTO governed trade relationship with the EU in the event of no deal would not represent an outcome that the electorate voted for.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.1. Pro: Vote Leave - [the official Brexit campaign](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/vote-leave-eu-referendum_uk_570e5074e4b00ed33e06b5f4) - clearly stated that there would be a deal.  It is clear from the second paragraph of[the "About The Campaign" section of their website](http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/campaign.html), and from page 10 of the Vote Leave ["Why Vote Leave" document.](http://view.publitas.com/15010/164151/pdfs/9b3d7fac7290257c2e72c7784537315b9351806e.pdf).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.1.1. Con: It is [predicted](https://www.conservativehome.com/video/2017/11/watch-ici-londres-britain-has-nothing-to-fear-from-trading-with-the-eu-on-wto-terms.html) that trading on WTO terms will, as a worst case scenario,  result in a less than a 2% decrease in trade with the EU which is 0.25% of GDP.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.2. Pro: Though it is not as explicit as Vote Leave, the other prominent Brexit campaign group - Leave.EU - clearly states [their vision](https://leave.eu/about/) that includes some kind of continued relationship with the EU, and explicitly lists Norway-plus and Canada models as options.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.3. Pro: Vote Leave said "we will [negotiate the terms of a new deal before we start any legal process to leave](http://view.publitas.com/15010/164151/pdfs/9b3d7fac7290257c2e72c7784537315b9351806e.pdf)".
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.3.1. Pro: The full quote is "Taking back control is a careful change, not a sudden step – we will negotiate the terms of a new deal before we start any legal process to leave"
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4. Con: [Many](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/do-you-support-or-oppose-the-conservative-policy-of-leaving-the-eu-without-a-deal-if-the-terms-are-unacceptable/) people voted for the Conservatives under the [assumption](https://euobserver.com/brexit/137962) that they would leave the EU even if it meant leaving without a deal.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1. Con: [52 percent](https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2017/results) of voters [chose](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39665835) parties who are [against](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-hard-leave-voters-labour-tory-mp-lies-boris-johnson-david-davis-jacob-rees-mogg-a8393841.html) a no-deal Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Labour, with [40%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2017/results) of the vote, was against a no-deal brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Keir Starmer, the shadow secretary of state for exiting the European Union, stated the Labour Party position on a no- deal Brexit, in a speech in April "[A Labour approach means rejecting no deal as a viable option](https://fullfact.org/europe/whats-labour-policy-no-deal-brexit/)"
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Labours manifesto said "Labour recognises that leaving the EU with ‘no deal’ is the worst possible deal for Britain and that it would do damage to our economy and trade. [We will reject ‘no deal’ as a viable option](https://brexitcentral.com/labours-manifesto-says-brexit/) and if needs be negotiate transitional arrangements to avoid a ‘cliff-edge’ for the UK economy."
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: The Liberal Democrats \(7.4%\), SNP \(3%\), and the Greens \(1.6%\) are [all strongly against](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39665835) Brexit, including a No Deal.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.3. Con: The 2017 election result cannot be taken as an effective endorsement of no deal, since it was a [general election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election) on a range of wider issues.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Two major terrorist attacks took place during the election campaign, with parties [arguing about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election#Security) the best way to prevent such events. This discussion would inevitably have effected some people's votes.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Social care became a major election issue after the Conservative Party's manifesto [included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election#Social_care) new proposals, which were subsequently altered after criticism.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.3.3. Pro: Polling shows that [only 21%](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/07/11/why-people-voted-labour-or-conservative-2017-gener) consider Brexit the main reason they voted for their Conservative MP.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.3.4. Pro: Polling shows that [65% of labour voters](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/07/11/why-people-voted-labour-or-conservative-2017-gener) main reason for voting was not Brexit related. This includes being Anti-Tory, liking Corbyn, and the NHS.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.2. Con: The Tories lost their majority in the election.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.3. Con: The [manifesto](https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto) says "Theresa May's Conservatives will deliver the best possible deal for Britain as we leave the European Union delivered by a smooth, orderly brexit". It goes on to say "the government believes that no deal is better than a bad deal but we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed to getting the best deal for Britain." It is clear and indeed [openly referred to](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44556764) that no deal was purely for negotiation purposes.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.1.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.5. Con: This claim simply isn't true as it conflates the 2017 general election result with the Brexit referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.6. Con: "No deal is better than a bad deal" was used once within the manifesto, and even then within the context of a commitment to getting a good deal; that does not constitute a "mantra". If anything, the [Conservative Party mantra](https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto) in their 2017 manifesto was "strong and stable leadership".
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.6.1. Pro: As the Conservatives were unable to deliver on their main manifesto promise, Strong and Stable leadership, we have no reason to expect them to deliver on any of their manifesto promises.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.7. Con: The electorate clearly voted for a Conservative manifesto that clearly states "the task ahead is too great" and so brexit should be cancelled.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.8. Pro: The Brexit Party [supports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit_Party) a no deal Brexit, and is expected to gain over [30%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48227459) of votes in the 2019 European elections. Many of these are [former Conservative voters](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/18/opinium-poll-conservatives-trounced-by-brexit-party-remainers-abandon-labour), suggesting there has always been support amongst the Conservative base for a no-deal Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.8.1. Con: As there [was no support](https://youtu.be/0xGt3QmRSZY) for a No Deal Brexit before the referendum, it rather suggests that the Brexit party has exploited public dissatisfaction with the handling of the Brexit process to push for an extremist position that simply wasn't part of the discussion before the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.4.9. Pro: There has been a core group of Tory MPs that [supported](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-8-tory-tribes-conservative-party/) a no-deal Brexit during the 2017 general election. These roughly [60 MPs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/19/heavyweight-brexiteers-go-public-as-60-tory-mps-demand-clean-bre/) were calling upon Theresa May to pursue a Hard Brexit with the EU. The fact that they got elected clearly illustrates that there are a lot of Conservatives who support a no-deal Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.5. Con: WTO governed trade allows beneficial trade deals to be struck and therefore is what the electorate voted for.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.6. Con: WTO governed trade does not preclude a good trade deal with the EU, which definitely represents the desires of the majority.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.7. Pro: Only about [35% of Leave voters](https://www.markpack.org.uk/154126/leave-voters-expected-britain-stay-single-market/) thought leaving meant leaving the single market, as would happen with no deal.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.8. Pro: Even [Nigel Farage](https://twitter.com/Femi_Sorry/status/1118817963874881536?s=09) advocated a deal on the same basis as Norway.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.9. Pro: The electorate knew what they were voting for and what they were voting for was the [deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldvt0O4ekV0) that the Prime Minister has come back with. If parliament does not find that deal acceptable, then they must deem that the electorate did not know what they were voting for.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10. Con: The public has shown more support for a No-Deal than for remaining.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.1. Con: [600 constituencies support Remain](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1114231615838916614), 2 support a deal, and 30 support no-deal, according to a December 2018 YouGov poll.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2. Pro: 46% of adults are confident that the UK will [ultimately be OK, after brief uncertainty, if it leaves the EU without a deal](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xVTypcjSb68J:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/03/19/no-deal-better-brexit-delay-say-public-poll-finds-just-one-10/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=de), according to a March 2019 poll by the Telegraph.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2.1. Pro: If the UK leaves the EU, Brexit MEP Lucy Harris believes it "will" rebound economically in about [30 years](https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-party-eu-elections-lucy-harris-economy-30-years-8919786).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2.1.1. Con: Many of those who voted in the referendum will be dead in 30 years time.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2.1.2. Con: There is [some uncertainty](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2018/jul/24/two-50-or-100-years-when-do-leavers-think-brexit-will-pay-off) regarding just how long it will take for the UK to make it back. Some Brexiteers think it will take 50 years to take advantage of Brexit, while others think it may be even longer than that.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2.2. Con: “Ultimately” is too vague a term. There’s no way to tell what time frame respondents had in mind: Would the average be 5 years, 25 years, 125 years? We have no way of knowing so the statistic is meaningless.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2.3. Con: "Brief" is too vague a term. There’s no way to tell what time frame respondents had in mind.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.2.4. Con: The Telegraph does not show it's methodology. As a newspaper with a [political bias for Leave](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-05-23-uk-newspapers-positions-brexit), there is a strong possibility of bias or intentional misleading.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.3. Pro: When asked "In the event of Parliament voting down the Brexit deal that the Government negotiates with the European Union, what do you think should happen next?" No Deal has [consistently been the top choice](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/in-the-event-of-parliament-voting-down-the-brexit-deal-that-the-government-negotiates-with-the-european-union-what-do-you-think-should-happen-next/) in a series of 9 polls \(2018/2019\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.3.1. Con: The cited article shows that no-deal has consistently been supported by a plurality of fewer than 30% of the responders.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.3.2. Con: This poll has several similar options which have split the vote of people who are against a no deal. If you combine the two "second vote" options, it easily overtakes the "no deal" option.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.3.2.1. Con: One of the "second vote" options is still between two variants on leave, without allowing for remaining.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.3.2.1.1. Con: That is consistently the less popularly supported of the two, enjoying approximately 10% support. Even summing it and no deal does not reach a simple majority.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.4. Pro: [45% of the public agreed](https://www.comresglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Leave-Means-Leave-April-Snap-Poll-Tables-Final-Published.pdf#page=11) when asked if we should leave and trade on “WTO rules” instead of delaying Brexit, with only 34% disagreeing, according to a Comres poll in April 2019.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.4.1. Con: The polls methodology [suffers from acquiescence bias](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/10054).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.4.1.1. Pro: When asked if you agree or disagree with something, you’re more likely to agree with the statement. The 45% could have been boosted by people answering “agree” when they may not have, had the question been worded more neutrally.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5. Pro: When given the choice of leaving with no deal or remaining, no deal is the most popular choice.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.1. Pro: [76%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/most-tory-members-would-choose-no-deal-over-may-brexit-plan) of conservative members party members chose 'No Deal' over remain in a ESRC survey.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.1.1. Con: Conservative voters are a minority of the UK population.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.1.2. Con: Conservative party members are [not representative](https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/members-only-views-conservative-party%E2%80%99s-rank-and-file) of the wider population.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2. Pro: YouGov polling in April 2019 found that [44% to 42% of Britons would prefer to leave with no deal](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/04/04/what-do-public-think-about-no-deal-brexit) if the alternative is remaining.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.1. Con: This poll did not include Northern Ireland, which is more pro Remain than Great Britain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.1.1. Pro: [55.8%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) of Northern Ireland voted remain, compared to only 48% in Great Britain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.1.2. Pro: By excluding a section of the electorate, this poll contributes towards [disinformation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Excluding Northern Ireland is the case with a lot of political polling in the UK, largely because Northern Ireland’s party system is different from the rest of the nation. This is less a purposeful disinformation campaign, and more a limitation of pre-existing political polling structures.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.1.2.2. Con: Disinformation is a deliberate act, but this poll openly stated where the results came from. Without attempting to hide or mislead, it is not disinformation.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2. Con: YouGov polls [consistently over-predict](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/r/53/YouGov%20Record%20May%202016.pdf) the pro no-deal party UKIP's success \(7 out of 9 recent polls\). These errors may also manifest in other no-deal related predictions.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.1. Con: UKIP were genuinely hard to predict, due to their volatility and over-representation in the media.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Potentially the largest election-time complaint to the BBC \(1190 complaints\) was that they [gave much coverage to UKIP](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/30/bbc-complaints-ukip-election-coverage-bias), or were biased in favour of the party.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: UKIP have had a [turbulent rise and fall](https://qz.com/1002422/uk-election-the-rise-and-fall-of-ukip-the-party-that-birthed-brexit/), which makes them much harder to predict than mainstream parties. They became the first party in 100 years that was not the Tories or Labour to win a nationwide election in 2014, but are [virtually dead](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-local-elections-nigel-farage-gerard-batten-brexit-collapse-a8293406.html) in 2018 with 75% fewer candidates.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.1.3. Pro: UKIP are over represented in the media because of over-optimistic polling.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.2. Con: Other polling sources regularly predicted UKIP higher than YouGov did.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: In the 2009 EU Elections, the 2014 EU Elections, and the 2015 General Elections [YouGov predicted UKIP lower \(or the lowest\) compared to other pollsters.](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/r/53/YouGov%20Record%20May%202016.pdf).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.2.2.2.2. Con: In the London mayor elections of 2016, [YouGov predicted UKIP higher](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/r/53/YouGov%20Record%20May%202016.pdf) than any other listed polls.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3. Con: If we want to know the answer to a different question to that asked in the referendum and be able to action it, then we need to formally ask that question in a referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1. Con: Polls work well at finding public opinion, therefore the government can use them to make decisions they know the public support.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.9.4.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.2. Pro: Looking at polls for the last week of campaigns for 220 national elections in 32 countries over the decades to 2017 – with data for a handful of countries stretching back to 1942 – [errors have held steady at about 2%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/polls-as-accurate-as-they-have-ever-been-study-says).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.3. Pro: A dataset of countries that had regular polling over several decades found that [polling errors have dropped over time](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/12/polls-as-accurate-as-they-have-ever-been-study-says).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.4. Pro: Recent popular [opinion](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/17/lords-tell-political-pollsters-to-get-house-in-order) that polls are getting worse are incorrect. There is [no evidence that](https://statfr.blogspot.com/2018/08/forecast-error-are-polls-getting-worse.html) poll errors have increased over time.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5. Con: The [bandwagon effect](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/how-political-opinion-polls-affect-voter-behaviour-60554) influences the results of democratic elections.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.1. Pro: Selective publication of single data points from misleading polls is part of a right-wing [tactical gaming](https://www.indy100.com/article/nigel-farage-andrew-marr-video-interview-watch-brexit-party-bbc-8911301) of the [media](https://youtu.be/79txI6-RZks).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2. Con: The bandwagon effect would continue without opinion polls, but instead be based on inaccurate perceptions.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: Without opinion polls, voters will rely on their 'gut feeling' of how likely each party is to win. This is more likely to be incorrect as it is based on circumstantial or anecdotal evidence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.1.1. Con: When politically motivated interest groups [commission polls](http://www.ncpp.org/?q=node/4), they are often not intended as a guide for voters to help them make correct political decisions, but are for [social and political commentators to sell news](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Af54b1e30-ebdb-4ea6-8ad4-09cf9112a1f1). They are [now being](https://fullfact.org/europe/telegraph-suspending-parliament/) [gamed by politicians](https://youtu.be/79txI6-RZks) to influence elections.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.1.2. Con: People's gut feeling about who they want to win cannot be incorrect. That, and knowledge of policies and track records, is precisely how people should make electoral choices, not on who is most likely to win.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: Gut feelings about "who they want to win" and "who they think will win" are different. Only the latter affects the bandwagon effect.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.1.3. Con: People's gut feeling, being more directly related to their emotions, experience and political views, of who is likely to win is a better measure than a badly worded and/ or politically motivated and/or selective option opinion poll.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.2. Pro: Bandwagon/contagion voting is a part of the human thought process, and not caused by polling. Humans want to be on the winning side, and so the effect would continue even if polls were unavailable.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.2.1. Con: The deliberate staging of polls excluding certain options or demographics to demonstrate support for preferred options exploits this effect.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Polls are easily abuseable, and are used to purposefully give false information in a package which many people will believe.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.3. Con: Constant repetitious polling amplifies the bandwagon effect by flooding media, notably [social media](https://twitter.com/LeaveEUOfficial/status/1128705404987498496?s=09), with bite-size [selective, unrepresentative data](https://europeelects.eu/2018/12/05/how-unpopular-is-french-president-macron-really/).

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.3.3. Con: The problem is with fake news, not fake polls.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.5.2.3.3.1. Pro: Purposeful misinformation is an inherent part of modern society, be that [outright fake news spreading faster than real news](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fake-news-spreads-more-quickly-on-twitter-than-real-news-2018-03-08) or the [mostly biased media](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/media-bias-left-study/) writing misleading or one-sided content.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.1.6. Con: Although polls give a good idea of public opinion, they also have an impact on public opinion due to the [bandwagon effect](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/how-political-opinion-polls-affect-voter-behaviour-60554). Conducting an [increasing number of polls](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/can-we-trust-the-polls-it-all-depends/), sometimes of disproportionate selected groups of the electorate or on limited selective options, is therefore irresponsible.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.3. Con: Referendums are generally a bad idea. They are the tools of dictators and demagogues, a point agreed by both Atlee and Thatcher.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.3.3.1. Con: -> See discussion #28455: All major political decisions should be made via public referendum.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.4. Con: In the [European elections](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/crjeqkdevwvt/the-uks-european-elections-2019) appoximately 40.4% of votes went to explicitly Pro-Remain parties \(LD, Green, SNP, Plaid, Change\) while only 34.9% went to explicit No-Deal parties \(Brexit, UKIP\). The remaining 23.2% went to parties currently trying to offer some form of compromise \(Labour, Conservative\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.4.1. Con: The turnout of 36.7% was fairly low, so the views expressed in these elections might not represent true support for the various options.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.4.2. Con: EU election results are an imperfect way to measure No-Deal/Remain sentiment, because it was a election on a wide range of issues.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.4.2.1. Pro: The Green Party may be seeing growth [due to](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/european-election-result-greens-green-wave-spd-germany-a8931351.html) the current environmental catastrophe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.5.4.2.2. Con: In the event of No-Deal, the MEPs elected would not even make it to Brussels. Thus for No-Deal supporting Brexiters there was no reason/incentive to vote for any party besides the Brexit Party.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.6. Con: The public does not support a no deal when all other options are kept on the table.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.6.1. Pro: In a February 2019 YouGov poll asking how good various outcome would be, the majority [preferred remaining or leaving with an alternative deal](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/03/01/where-we-stand-brexit), and also narrowly accepted leaving with Mays withdrawal bill over the No-deal brexit option.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.10.6.2. Pro: According to YouGov polling in April 2019 asking for peoples "Preferred Option" [only 26% of respondants chose No deal.](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/04/04/what-do-public-think-about-no-deal-brexit) 37% prefered remaining, and 23% prefered a deal.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3. Pro: The referendum was badly drafted, because it did not distinguish between vastly different versions of Brexit. [Leave voters themselves do not agree which version they want.](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/glo3xaqerh/InternalResults_170327_AnthonyBrexitQs_W.pdf) If and when the Government eventually decides what Brexit it wants, the majority of the public may be against it.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.2. Con: This point confuses the role of the referendum - to decide whether to leave the EU - and the role of government, which is to negotiate arrangements with 3rd parties on our behalf.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.2.1. Con: The decision to leave the EU can only be made properly when the alternative to the EU is clear. While they are two different processes, one may choose to leave the EU in the hope of a particular alternative, but the actual alternative offered in the end may be much worse, at which point the initial decision to leave the EU is not legitimate.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.3. Pro: Voting for Leave in the Brexit referendum, by a narrow margin of [51.89-48.11](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results), was not necessarily a vote for a hard Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.3.1. Pro: [Many people](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/attitudes-brexit-everything-we-know-so-far/) considered maintaining access to the single market an important priority in the negotiations.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.3.2. Pro: A roughly 50/50 split, as in this case, cannot be considered a consensus of the British people.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.3.3. Pro: We do not know the breakdown of issues that people voted Leave for, but it is clear that there were those who did so on the understanding that the UK would remain in the Single Market. If we leave the Single Market, the will of those particular Leave voters would be disrespected.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: One of those voters so disrespected would be Nigel [Farage](https://twitter.com/Femi_Sorry/status/1132305288357400578?s=09). Nigel Farage is the leader of the Brexit Party, who are campaigning for the UK to leave the EU with no deal. Nigel Farage has, having told one story to win the referendum vote, changed his position to a far more extreme one and is pretending nothing has changed.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.4. Pro: "Referendums should be held when people know exactly what they are getting... We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards" David Davis \(now Secretary of State for Leaving the EU\) [said](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021126/debtext/21126-17.htm) in 2002.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.5. Con: The exact outcome does not need to be clear for the result to have democratic legitimacy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.5.2.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.5.2. Pro: Compared to a manifesto that voters use to determine which party they will vote for at a general election, the question and possible outcomes were narrower for this referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.3.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5. Pro: Remaining in the EU would exacerbate political instability.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.1. Con: Disarray in British politics isn't necessarily negative, as it may call into question the existing system and lead to calls for reform.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.1.1. Pro: This reform could include rethinking the two \(three\) party system, and the need for proportionality voting. If Brexit does not work out, it may become clear that having two parties vying for votes by diametrically opposing each other does not lead to successful policies. It may indicate the need for broader electoral support, and coalitions between parties.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3. Con: A hard Brexit threatens the constitutional set-up of the United Kingdom and its associated territories, more so than overturning the referendum result and staying in the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.1. Con: A hard Brexit is simply an excuse used by people who wanted to threaten the unity of the United Kingdom before the Brexit referendum was even a glimmer in David Cameron's eye.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.1.1. Pro: Sinn Fein has [long been calling for reunification](http://www.firstdail.com/?page_id=208) of the island of Ireland since well before the EU referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.1.2. Pro: The SNP has long [been calling for](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) secession of Scotland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.1.3. Pro: Welsh nationalists have [long been calling for](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_nationalism) secession of Wales.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.1.4. Con: Brexit gives weight to nationalist political parties who will insist that England is forcing its own agenda on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2. Pro: A hard Brexit could trigger a second independence referendum within Scotland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.1. Con: This could happen anyway. All voters in the first Scottish referendum were aware there was an upcoming referendum on EU membership and so this was factored in to voting decisions.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.1.1. Con: The campaign for Scotland remaining in the UK stated:["What is process for removing our EU citizenship? Voting yes."](https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en) This suggests voters did not factor this in to their decision. In fact, it claimed that their desire to stay in the EU was a reason to vote for the Union, whereas today they would more likely to see independence as the best route to staying in the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.2. Pro: If Brexit proves to harm the UK economy as many people predict, then it could persuade enough people in Scotland to leave the UK. During the original Scottish Independence Referendum, the Better Together website said: “Scotland enjoys membership of the EU because of our membership of the UK and if we no longer are members of the UK then it follows that we are no longer part of the EU.” [Link](https://www.snp.org/broken_promises_by_tories_and_no_campaign_since_indyref). Scots who voted to stay in the UK for continued EU membership now feel cheated as a result of Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.3. Con: The SNP is unlikely to hold a second independence referendum as only [46%](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/what-the-latest-polls-tell-us-about-scottish-independence-1-4636493) of Scots support it.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: It is highly unlikely that the SNP will choose to call for a second referendum unless they're certain to win, as a loss would be a devastating blow to their party.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.3.2. Pro: The Scottish National Party does not have an [established timeframe](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/27/nicola-sturgeon-shelves-second-independence-referendum) for a second referendum, showing no current intention to push for one.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.4. Pro: First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon claims it is ["likely"](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40415457) that a referendum will take place before 2021.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.4.1. Pro: The Scottish Government were elected on a manifesto that said they would seek to hold another referendum in the event of a vote for Brexit. They won a majority of seats at UK and Scottish level on this manifesto.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.4.2. Con: It is in the interests of the leader of the Scottish National Party to claim a second referendum will take place, as it will keep her hard nationalist base happy. Her statements should not be read as accurate predictions.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.4.3. Con: It is impossible for there to be another Independence Referendum without approval from the Prime Minister under [Section 30 of the Scotland Act](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/section-30-scotland-act-1998-important/).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.2.5. Pro: Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay within the European Union, a margin of [62% to 38%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results), with every single electorate returning a majority in favour of Remain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3. Con: Strong independence movements exist within the European Union, as illustrated by the recent [crisis in Catalonia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41584864). There's no reason to believe that remaining in the EU would protect the UK from secession.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3.1. Con: Calatonian independence movement is [pro EU](https://frontnews.eu/news/en/13858/Catalonia-wants-to-stay-in-European-Union-president-of-Catalan-Government). In the UK Northern Ireland independence movement [wants to get independence](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/northern-ireland-support-join-irish-republic-eu-hard-brexit-poll-lucidtalk-a8098531.html) mainly because after Brexit the free border with Ireland will be closed, resulting in [huge damages](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/brexit/predicted-brexit-hit-to-northern-ireland-economy-reality-check-for-may-and-dup-36580101.html) for the Northern Ireland economy and in a hard divison of the island.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: The EU contributed to [8.4%](http://www.paxetbellum.org/2017/03/21/could-brexit-summon-the-ghosts-of-the-troubles/) of the Northern Irish GDP through financial aid. Without its support the Northern Irish economy will suffer.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3.1.1.1. Con: This was the UK's money to begin with. The UK government has [already committed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/dup-deal-latest-how-much-extra-money-funding-theresa-may-conservative-tory-uk-taxpayers-a7809231.html) to very significant increases in NI funding.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3.1.1.2. Con: This assumes a post Brexit UK will not be able to secure new lucrative trade opportunities, which is very much up for debate.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3.1.1.3. Con: Westminster is likely to offer more financial support to plug the gap, both because of the [DUP's position](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-may/may-strikes-1-billion-deal-with-dup-to-prop-up-government-idUKKBN19H0H3) in Theresa May's government, and to ensure stability.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.3.2. Con: Ruling by example is good choice. It's difficult to claim union while breaking up bigger commitments in pro of equality in terms of rights and obligations
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.4. Pro: A hard Brexit threatens British sovereignty over Gibraltar \(a small territory [bordering Southern Spain](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gibraltar/\@36.218638,-5.4795662,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd0cbf762714be35:0x384e25263600870f!8m2!3d36.140751!4d-5.353585)\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.4.1. Con: A change to the status of Gibraltar would not alter the constitutional set-up of the UK, as Gibraltar is not part of the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.4.1.1. Con: Gibraltar is part of the Overseas Territories of the UK, and therefore it affects the constitution of the UK by proxy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.4.2. Con: Spain's primary route to bullying and threatening the people of Gibraltar is through its use of [veto](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/will-the-uk-lose-gibraltar) in the EU. If there is no deal with the EU, Spain has nothing to veto. A soft Brexit is therefore much more threatening to Gibraltar.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.4.2.1. Con: Spain's veto applies to any future EU deals, and so while a no deal may leave Spain temporarily with nothing to veto, when the UK eventually makes a trade deal with the EU Spain will still be able to use it.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.4.3. Pro: Spain has been [awarded a veto](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/will-the-uk-lose-gibraltar) on all trade deals with Gibraltar in future EU negotiations. It could use this to strong-arm Gibraltar to accept Spanish sovereignty.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5. Pro: A hard Brexit would throw into disarray the constitutional arrangement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which represents a serious threat to the peace of the citizens of Northern Ireland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.1. Con: There is no constitutional legal barrier to the UK leaving the EU. The constitutional arrangement between NI and the rest of the UK predates the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.2. Con: The party which won 55% of NI seats in the 2017 general election campaign had a [manifesto committment to leave the EU](https://brexitcentral.com/dup-manifesto-said-brexit/), and to renege on this would throw into disarray the constitutional arrangement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which represents a serious threat to peace for the citizens of Northern Ireland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.2.1. Con: Notwithstanding the percentage of seats won, this party represents a minority position \(25.7%\) 1.2% above the second placed party. [UK General election 2017 \(Northern Ireland\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2017_\(Northern_Ireland\))
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.2.2. Con: Manifesto commitments are often [dropped](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto) by Governments when proved to be unpopular or unworkable.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3. Pro: A hard exit from the EU could call the [Good Friday Agreement](http://politicalcritique.org/world/uk/2017/what-would-a-hard-brexit-mean-for-ireland/) into question and could possibly cause a return to the violence and terror present in Northern Ireland during [The Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.1. Pro: Violence has never fully ceased in Northern Ireland and so it would not be a large stretch for it to return to the way it was before the Good Friday Agreement.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: On Feb 2017 there was a [bomb explosion](https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/derry-bomb-culmore-device-at-police-officers-home-more-intricate-than-a-basic-pipe-bomb-35472857.html) at a police officer’s house in Derry/Londonderry. It is suspected that this was planned by violent dissident republicans.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.2. Con: There is nothing in the Good Friday Agreement that prohibits the UK leaving the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.2.1. Con: The Good Friday Agreement makes references to both the UK and the Republic of Ireland being part of the EU as well as an open border. Creating a hard border would violate the terms of the agreement and hence would need to be rewritten with consent from both sides. History has proved this to be very difficult. [Good Friday Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-belfast-agreement)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.3. Pro: The Sinn Féin President, [Gerry Adams](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-northern-irealand-gerry-adams-sinn-fein-good-friday-agreement-peace-eu-a7539011.html), argued that Brexit will ‘destroy the Good Friday Agreement’, being at odds with consent for change, undermining its human rights elements and reinforcing the border.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.4. Pro: The Police Service of Northern Ireland has [observed](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) that dissident Republicans and criminal gangs will also seek to tap into the smuggling opportunity presented by a customs border. This could lead to reorganization of old groups as well as new financial streams for them.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.5. Con: Irish Republicans currently [lack](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) political leadership to organize violence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.5.1. Con: While they lack a prominent leader this does not seem to be stifling growth. Republican clubs and societies – broadly supportive of armed violence against the British state and not directly controlled by the Sinn Féin leadership − are [increasingly active](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) in border communities, drawing energy from the anger that has swelled in these areas since the Brexit vote.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6. Con: The UK will no doubt have to [increase support for peace](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/twt/brexit-s-threat-northern-ireland) programs and negotiate a new border policy. But with sensible policies peace in Northern Ireland can be maintained.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1. Con: A hard Brexit would lead to the return of an enforced border between Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1.1. Pro: The fact there are no customs checks on the border [is reliant on](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42180074) Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland having the same food, animal welfare, environmental, and other standards. Without these, customs checks would be needed.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1.2. Con: The border could be, in effect, [moved to the Irish Sea](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42180074), leaving Northern Ireland effectively within the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1.2.1. Con: This would effectively allow Northern Ireland a "back door" into the EU market. In the context of a hard Brexit this would likely be unacceptable to the EU member states.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1.2.2. Con: Both the UK government and the DUP in Northern Ireland have [ruled out](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42180074) this option.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1.2.2.1. Con: The UK government have ruled out membership of the single market and the customs union. They've ruled out a hard border across the island. They've ruled out a border down the Irish Sea. This is, for obvious reasons, a logically incoherent position. The UK will have no choice but to renege on one of these commitments.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.7. Pro: Brexit occurs at a time when[shifting demographics in Northern Ireland](https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/catholic-population-set-to-dwarf-protestants-in-years-ahead-1-7872318) are tipping in favour of nationalists. Already, in the most recent elections, the unionist majority has disappeared. Within a decade, there will be a significant nationalist [majority in favour of unification](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/demographics-are-shifting-towards-a-united-ireland-we-must-have-a-plan-35865222.html). Tensions between communities are running high and there is truly the potential for a return to conflict and violence. Everything must be done to ensure the GFA is protected and a hard border across the island is avoided.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.8. Pro: Irish member of parliament [Neale Richmond](http://nationalpost.com/news/world/is-brexit-going-to-restart-the-troubles-in-northern-ireland) warned that border posts would be a “target for dissident paramilitaries.”
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.8.1. Con: The UK government has [repeatedly stated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41365301) there will be no Irish border posts.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.8.1.1. Con: Stating something does not make it real. A stated desire for no border posts is a negotiating position, not a fact.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.4. Pro: The possibility of a no-deal Brexit has already [shifted the balance](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/mary-dejevsky) in Northern Ireland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5. Pro: A hard Brexit could lead to a secession of Northern Ireland to rejoin the Republic of Ireland and the European Union.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.1. Pro: The tightening of border controls, which would be necessary after a hard Brexit, will increase support for the succession of Northern Ireland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.3.6.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.2. Con: This could happen anyway independent of Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.1.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.3. Pro: Northern Ireland voted to Remain in the EU by a [10% margin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results) \(55-45\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.4. Con: The Democratic Unionist Party, the [largest party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly) in the Northern Irish Assembly, is [opposed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4172307.stm) to seccession.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.4.1. Con: The politics of Ireland are incredibly volatile, there has not been a Government in Northern Ireland [since January 2017](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21731338-belfasts-politicians-continue-bicker-brexit-talks-go-without-them-northern-ireland-hasnt) due to the collapse of power sharing. Therefore the continuation of the DUP as the major party in Northern Ireland is not guaranteed.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: The Unionist Parties \([pro-union](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4172307.stm) with the UK\) hold only a [small plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly) over the Nationalist Parties \([pro-unification](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4172307.stm) with Southern Ireland\) in the Northern Irish Assembly.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.5. Con: Even after the Brexit vote, support in Northern Ireland for reunification only stands at [22%](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/sharp-rise-in-support-for-united-ireland-survey-reveals-1.2784882).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.5.1. Con: While [22 per cent](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/sharp-rise-in-support-for-united-ireland-survey-reveals-1.2784882?mode=amp) seems a low percentage, what is important is that it was a five-point increase in support for a United Ireland from 17 per cent in 2013. Since 2016 when this poll was taken support has continued to rise.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.5.5.1.1. Pro: In a [poll](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/13/theresa-may-just-negotiated-away-the-united-kingdom/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) taken in December 2017 a majority in Northern Ireland \(51 percent\) supported unification under the Irish Republic to remain in the European Union in the event of a “hard” Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.6. Pro: Preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be [incompatible](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/06/brexit-bind-hard-border-ireland-could-unavoidable-uks-customs/) with leaving the Customs Union.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.6.1. Con: This is a solvable problem according to the British government and [the former Taoiseach \(Prime Minister\) of Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/bertie-ahern-technology-and-turning-blind-eye-could-solve-brexit-border-issue-1.3306710).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.6.1.1. Pro: One possible solution that has been [mooted](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/bertie-ahern-technology-and-turning-blind-eye-could-solve-brexit-border-issue-1.3306710?mode=amp) is to introduce technology to manage multinational trade while turning a blind eye to lower-level cross-frontier movement.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.6.1.1.1. Con: "Turning a blind eye" allows the movement of EU immigrants into the UK and vice versa. Brexit was claimed to be about taking back control of our borders. ROI/EU also has the right to controlled migration from the UK of both UK citizens and migrants we allow in too.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.3.5.6.1.2. Pro: If Britain leaves the EU common market a hard Irish border could be avoided if policies were implemented to separate Northern Ireland's market from the rest of the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.4. Con: Domestic British politics will be in chaos now whatever happens.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.4.1. Pro: Given the narrow margin of victory, any course taken after the referendum was bound to throw British politics into chaos.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.4.2. Con: British politics would be even more thrown into chaos by a Hard Brexit, which would create [a shortage of food and medicine](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-no-deal-food-medicine-shortage-doomsday-armageddon-david-davis-a8381076.html).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.4.2.1. Con: The source above also has a government official saying: 'A significant amount of work and decision-making has gone into the no-deal plans, especially where it relates to ports, and we know that none of this would come to pass.'
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.4.2.1.1. Con: An example of "No deal planning" is the infamous "[Seabourne Ferries](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/04/chris-grayling-brexit-pizza-ferry-company-zero-ships)" contract worth £14million granted to a company without ferries with their T&C copied off a takeaway menu. This can probably be assumed to be typical.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.5. Con: Fractured and irreconcilable differences over the EU is the cause of the failure of the Conservative Party, which is the [cause](https://www.ft.com/content/0dee56c0-fdfa-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e) of the failure of uk politics and leaving will not address this issue.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.5.1. Pro: This failure started with the holding of the referendum, a decision made by David Cameron. It was not necessary. Politicians frequently break campaign promises because it's impractical not to when it's not practical to completely research an issue before the campaign and yet it's necessary to make a best guess on a wide variety of issues.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6. Pro: Refusing to enact the specific instructions from the electorate may lead to widespread civil disobedience, with negative consequences that dwarf any possible drawbacks from a hard Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.1. Pro: Perceived refusal by politicians to listen to voters has led to widespread and longstanding disruption in France through the [Yellow Vest movement.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement) Similar protests could become commonplace in the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.1.1. Con: The [Yellow Vests movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement) does not appear to be primarily devoted to a failure of French politicians to listen to the voters. Rather its focus is on fuel prices and other mundane issues which boil down to a focus on money. Thus there are no lessons to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of their very different respective motivations.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.1.2. Con: Protesting against taxes is common, and does not indicate any increased likelihood of violent protests against a very different issue: a government ignoring a referendum decision.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: There were [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_acts_of_tax_resistance#21st_Century) protests against taxation in 2018, including major protests in [Jordan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/jordan-anti-tax-protests-resume-government-seeks-dialogue-181214071233264.html) and [Bulgaria](https://in.reuters.com/article/bulgaria-protests/thousands-protest-in-bulgaria-against-high-fuel-prices-car-taxes-idINKCN1NG0P1).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.1.2.2. Pro: There have been [protests against taxes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_tax_riots) in the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.1.3. Pro: Any similar protests in the UK would be stronger, because they would be protesting a specific failure to listen to clearly voted upon issue \(the referendum\) rather than a general economic protest about high taxes.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.2. Pro: MPs [have](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/02/26/delaying-brexit-risks-surge-right-wing-extremism-warns-jacob/) [warned](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1097228/Brexit-news-UK-EU-Theresa-May-deal-European-Union-vote-Commons) that delays to Brexit will cause significant anger amongst the public.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.2.1. Con: Brexit has been [delayed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47889404). There has been no related violence.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.3. Con: MP's have the responsibility to act in the best interests of the country as they see those interests, not to accede to threats of civil disobedience.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.3.1. Pro: [73.8%](http://home.bt.com/news/uk-news/how-mps-voted-in-the-eu-referendum-11364110245462) of MPs voted Remain.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4. Con: A no-deal Brexit will likely lead to violence as well.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4.1. Pro: [Supermarkets](https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/no-deal-brexit-supermarket-food-shortages-looting-preparations/) are preparing for looting and riots as a result of food shortages following a no-deal Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4.2. Pro: The [Government](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/plan-to-evacuate-the-queen-after-a-no-deal-brexit-35hft7ctw) has updated emergency evacuation plans in preperation for a no-deal scenario.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4.3. Pro: According to an EU source secret [EU reporting says](https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/28/riots-will-hit-streets-brexit-uk-will-unstable-years-eu-report-warns-8404836/) 'violence is almost inevitable no matter what.' 'They are worried that if the current deal goes through the right-wing will kick off. If there’s no deal everybody will object and kick off. If there’s a second referendum, the right will kick off.'
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4.4. Pro: [Police chiefs](https://news.sky.com/story/police-plan-for-civil-unrest-after-no-deal-brexit-11493685) could be forced to call on the military to tackle civil disorder in the event of a "no-deal" Brexit, according to a leaked document.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4.5. Pro: The potential impacts as detailed in [Operation Yellowhammer](https://brexitfacts.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/yellowhammer-factsheet/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwvfrBRBIEiwA2nFiPTedUTT50fCl1GpmdJvKVEl1AXqZw113i_kzJE9phRDf9CXZYtKvyxoCCuEQAvD_BwE) are far more likely, as the government's own analysis makes clear, to lead to civil unrest and disobedience.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.6.4.5.1. Pro: The [government's presentation](https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/operation-yellowhammer-no-deal-brexit-report-base-case-reasonable-worst-title/) of a base case scenario as "reasonable worst case" is likely to lead to fury if no deal is enacted and the warnings come to pass.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.8. Con: Even just trying to leave the EU has brought down [two](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union) [governments](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-46225949), and may in fact be about to [destroy the two-party system](https://theweek.com/articles/817787/how-britain-ends) which had carried on for a century. That's pretty [unstable](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-19/brexit-could-spell-the-end-of-the-united-kingdom/10510052).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.8.1. Pro: The process has already been the downfall of two Prime Ministers.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9. Con: The UK leaving the EU politically harms the EU and wider Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.1. Con: The harming of the EU will provide impetus for the EU to offer a better deal to encourage the UK to rejoin.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.1.1. Con: The UK hasn't left yet, so it can't rejoin. If the UK were to seek to rejoin after it left, it would likely mean having to sign up to schengen, euro and EU army, arguably a worse position than it currently enjoys.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.1.2. Con: The terms for the UK to rejoin the EU are likely to be worse than those it already has as a full member.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2. Pro: Brexit strengthens [Eurosceptic parties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/european-far-right-hails-britains-brexit-vote-marine-le-pen) throughout Europe \(making other exit votes more likely\), posing an existential threat to the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.1. Pro: EU politicians [fear](http://www.cer.eu/insights/impact-brexit-eu) the greater German dominance that will emerge without the UK's check on German will.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.1.1. Pro: Poland saw Brexit as negative, largely because the UK acted as a [counterweight](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-mourns-brexit/) to the eurozone countries \(particularly Germany\) and therefore aligned with its interests.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2. Con: [Approval](https://qz.com/1153966/britain-rejected-the-eu-and-the-eu-is-loving-its-new-life/) of the EU has gone up amongst the citizens of Germany, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and France since the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2.1. Pro: Even Italy's eurosceptic 5-Star Movement, which leads opinion polls ahead of the upcoming election, has [abandoned](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-election-5star/italys-5-star-presents-election-program-with-no-euro-referendum-idUSKBN1FB1LM) its plans for a referendum on membership in the eurozone.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2.2. Con: Brexit, as a symbol of a populist uprising agains the globalist order, has emboldened actors \(such as Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orbán](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3jmba/trumps-victory-and-brexit-have-emboldened-hungarys-prime-minister-to-lead-a-populist-revolt-in-europe)\) who, while not wanting to leave the EU, seek to [undermine](http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/viktor-orban-enemy-within-1-5300076) it.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2.2.1. Con: Orbán is the democratically elected and extremely popular prime minister of Hungary and should not be glibly maligned.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2.3. Pro: [Eurobarometer 88](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/instruments/STANDARD/surveyKy/2143) \(p. 15\) confirms an improving overall image of the EU since the Brexit referendum in 2016.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.3. Con: The UK's fall from the fastest growing member of the G7 to the [slowest](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/uk-economy-lags-behind-g7-after-2017-growth-rate-cut-idUKKCN1G6110) will serve as a warning to other countries as to the effect of leaving the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.3.1. Con: The citizens of other countries aren’t stupid enough to look at short term economic blips but rather longer term trends.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.3.2. Con: This only applies if Brexit is extremely harmful for the UK economy in the long term, a point which is [heavily contested](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/brexit-success-story-leaders-lost-plot-uk).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.3.2.1. Con: The short term harm to the economy can also serve as a signal to the remaining members of the EU to not arrange for a referendum, especially as a short term economic hit would be attributed to the ruling party in question.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.3. Con: The EU will feel a greater sense of [cohesiveness](https://www.thebalance.com/brexit-consequences-4062999) without the UK holding it back on key issues.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.3.2. Con: EU's cohesion policy is in under threat due to economic and financial effects of Brexit. [Budget consequences article.](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-gets-glimpse-of-post-brexit-eu-budget-horrors/) [Report on cohesion policy challenges in the light of Brexit.](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/83499/1/Begg_Cohesion%20policy_2017.pdf)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.3.3. Pro: EU officials think [greater integration](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-future-timmermans/germany-and-france-to-lead-post-brexit-eu-in-further-integration-idUSKBN19I14O) will be possible without the UK's opposition.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.3.3.1. Pro: The UK's special EU Reform deal would have included exemption from the "[Ever Closer Union](https://fullfact.org/europe/explaining-eu-deal-ever-closer-union/)" of the EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.3.4. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.2.2.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.4. Con: The UK has no obligation to the EU, and should only do what is in its interests. The harms to the EU of Brexit are irrelevant.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.4.1. Con: If the UK leaving the EU harms the lives of millions of people in Europe, this is a relevant factor in the decision at a moral level.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.4.1.1. Pro: Even in terms of national interest, acting immorally by harming the lives of European citizens also has a negative consequence of harming the UK's relations and public image.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.4.2. Con: This debate is not inherently from the UK's perspective. It is unclear why we should not also factor in the benefit of hundreds of millions of people in Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.4.3. Con: Whether within or outside of the EU the UK needs to take the interests of its closest allies \(the EU member states\) into account for its foreign policy. This is because they share many geopolitical interests which are less likely to be promoted with a weakened EU.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.4.4. Con: The harms to the EU can lead to economical, political or other crises which can spread beyond the EU borders.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5. Pro: A hard Brexit makes the expansion of the EU more [challenging.](https://www.ft.com/content/2cd87b08-42ac-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d)
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.1. Pro: The UK has long been a [vocal proponent of extending](https://www.ft.com/content/2cd87b08-42ac-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d) the bloc into ex-communist central and eastern Europe. Other donor states will become less willing and able to support this without the support and funding of the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.1.1. Con: Germany, not the UK, has taken the lead on many accession talks [since 2014](http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1014763485&Country=Albania&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=International+relations).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2. Con: EU expansion is bad for Europe and bad for accession states.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.1. Con: Growth potential in accession states like [Serbia](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-future-of-serbia-s-economy/) and [Ukraine](https://www.ft.com/content/9d2173a2-60d7-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1) is high. They could be strong trade partners for the EU \(and the UK if they stay\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.2. Con: The influence of Russia in the [Balkans](http://www.lse.ac.uk/LSEE-Research-on-South-Eastern-Europe/Assets/Documents/Events/Conferences-Symposia-Programmes-and-Agendas/2015-Report-Russia-in-the-Balkans-merged-document.pdf) and [Ukraine](http://theweek.com/articles/449691/ukraines-fraught-relationship-russia-brief-history) is troublesome for the UK and the EU. Russia constitutes an [attractive model](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/ever-farther-union-balkans-and-brexit) of government for a number of regional leaders, who might seek to align their policies more with Russia and other non-EU actors. If these states are not brought into the EU fold they may fall back under the influence of Russia which is not in the UK or EU's interest geopolitically.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.3. Con: Prospects of EU accession have long been drivers of reforms preventing ethnic conflict and discrimination. Political analysts and diplomats worry that the loss of EU leverage in accession states could pose a [security threat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-cee-integration/central-european-states-urge-eu-to-speed-up-enlargement-in-west-balkans-idUSKBN19V1FT) for entire European community.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.4. Pro: As [Greece](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21724810-country-saves-too-much-and-spends-too-little-why-germanys-current-account-surplus-bad) demonstrated, some states in the EU cannot compete with the larger and more developed economies of Western Europe. This leads to loss of industry, jobs, and forces the countries to run government deficits to offset trade imbalances.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.5. Pro: As we see with [Hungary](http://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/09/04/defending-eu-values-in-poland-and-hungary-pub-72988), some states have competing values to the EU and once added foment internal conflict and a crisis of common values.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.5.1. Pro: -> See discussion #19119: Hungary should leave the European Union.

1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.5.4. Pro: Turkey, run by what is considered to be an [authoritarian regime](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/how-erdogan-made-turkey-authoritarian-again/492374/) by many, is one of the states that has been considered historically in accession debates. Its competing values upon admission would certainly call the EU's values into question.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.6. Pro: New member states tend to put economic strains on the funds of the union as we have [seen in the past](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2565277.stm). This not only puts economic strain on the union, but reduces the available structural funding for current EU recipients.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.7. Con: The EU is [based on](https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/human-rights_en) “freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.” This is universal and does not just apply to original member states. Once they meet democratic and economic criteria, the EU has a moral obligation to let accession states in.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.8. Con: Adding new members to the EU like Ukraine and states in the Western Balkans gives it strength in numbers and increased leverage on a global stage as a bloc.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.3. Pro: Brexit makes states deciding to join the EU more [uncertain](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/ever-farther-union-balkans-and-brexit) about its future and thus [less likely](https://www.voanews.com/a/brexit-dampens-zeal-for-serbias-eu-bid/3407552.html) to join.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.3.1. Con: The accession process is likely to remain a foreign policy priority for all western Balkan countries because these states do not have a [viable economic alternative](http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1014763485&Country=Albania&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=International+relations).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.5.2.2.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6. Pro: Brexit will harm the economies of EU countries.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.1. Pro: European countries will experience [reduced trade volumes](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-impact-on-european-regions-revealed-by-eu-report-phase-2-negotiations/) because of trade restrictions with the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.2. Pro: The loss of the UK's total contribution to the EU budget leaves a gap to fill of just over [5 percent](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-europe/from-trade-to-migration-how-brexit-may-hit-the-eu-economy-idUKKCN0ZA0KE).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.2.1. Pro: This will necessitate cuts in the budget, perhaps causing [development funds](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-gets-glimpse-of-post-brexit-eu-budget-horrors/) for Western European nations to be scrapped.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.3. Con: A [number of companies](https://www.verdict.co.uk/which-companies-could-leave-the-uk-because-of-brexit/) may relocate to other countries within the EU after the UK leaves.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4. Pro: The loss of jobs for migrant workers may [harm](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-europe/from-trade-to-migration-how-brexit-may-hit-the-eu-economy-idUKKCN0ZA0KE) the economies that currently export workers to the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4.1. Pro: Migrants working in the UK sent [£1.5 billion to £16.5 billion in Remittances](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrant-remittances-to-and-from-the-uk/) to their home countries \(in 2014\).
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4.2. Con: Skilled migrant workers remaining in their home countries may in fact boost their economies.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4.2.1. Pro: Poland is [actively attempting](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-hopes-brexit-will-lead-its-native-stars-home/) to draw skilled young workers back from the UK to benefit the Polish economy.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Poland is the [biggest](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36620886) beneficiary of EU funds, which are transforming the country. The UK leaving means there are less funds for countries like Poland.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4.3. Con: Other EU developed EU economies, such as France and Germany, may [benefit](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-europe/from-trade-to-migration-how-brexit-may-hit-the-eu-economy-idUKKCN0ZA0KE) from an influx of workers who can no longer work in the UK.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.5. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.6.4.2.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.7. Pro: Europe faces a world in turmoil. The UK will be weaker outside the EU. This is not the time for Brexit. This is the time to come together and stand up for Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.7.1. Pro: Russian mafia groups are [reported](http://www.dw.com/en/russian-mafia-groups-reportedly-operate-in-europe-on-behalf-of-the-kremlin/a-38617828) to be operating in the EU on behalf of the Russian government.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.7.2. Pro: Some criminal gangs in Russia may be [more powerful](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/03/16/russian_exile_mikhail_khodorkovsky_a_criminal_gang_runs_the_kremlin_putin_may_no_longer_be_main_boss.html) than the government itself, and thus represent an even greater risk for the stability of Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.7.3. Pro: The political turmoil in the United States is [destabilising](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/markets/us-political-turmoil-sends-shockwave-through-global-markets-1.3312843) the stock market in European countries.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.9.7.4. Pro: The United States Trump government [may be corrupt](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-white-house-howard-dean-vermont-governor-criminal-democratic-dnc-chair-a8130396.html), which means it is perhaps a less useful and less reliable ally for Europe.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.10. Con: Leaving the EU is a project that is so all-encompassing that it will dominate the activities of the British government for years to come. Therefore without a majority-supported clear course of action, Brexit is unsustainable in the long term, and even in the short term.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.10.1. Pro: The much needed [adults' social care green paper](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8002) continues to be further delayed due to civil servant distraction with brexit issues.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.11. Con: By remaining in the EU, the UK would be able to operate broadly as before but with clear caveats regarding some issues that concern its citizens.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12. Pro: Deciding to remain in the EU grants UKIP a new and powerful antiestablishment narrative of betrayal.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.1. Con: Nigel Farage [has already made comments contradicting himself on the economic benefits of Brexit.](https://twitter.com/open_britain/status/1002472366629322752) It will also be possible to present an equally powerful narrative of UKIP as being con-artists and betrayers.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.2. Pro: UKIP is immensely culturally divisive. Past leaders such as Nigel Farage have made racist, sexist, and xenophobic [comments](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-resigns-ukip-leader-brexit-leave-most-controversial-moments-racism-sexism-immigration-a7118801.html). Current UKIP leader Henry Bolton has [stated](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/11/leadership-hopeful-warns-wrong-leader-could-turn-ukip-into-uks-nazi-party-henry-bolton) that under the wrong leadership, UKIP risks becoming the "UK Nazi Party."
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.2.1. Pro: UKIP has close [ties](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/10/ukip-faces-questions-far-right-europe-for-freedom-and-democracy) to extreme far-right, anti-Islam parties in Europe, such as the Italian Lega Nord.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.2.2. Pro: When addressing issues such as immigration, UKIP [chooses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10782059/Nigel-Farage-takes-his-message-to-the-country.html) to frame the debate as a struggle between the "Westminster elite" and the rest of Britain, rather than engaging in substantive debate on whatever the issue is at hand. This makes productive discourse around such matters more difficult.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.3. Pro: UKIP was accused of inciting racial [hatred](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants) with its controversial "breaking point" posters.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.4. Pro: As they [considered](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/19/two-tory-mps-defect-ukip-wins-rochester-reckless) in 2014, the newly empowered UKIP will lure in many disaffected Tories, making it difficult to form a majority government.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.5. Con: Leaving the EU to just to appease Ukip sympathisers is giving in to ransom. Historically this validates and strengthens their overall narrative. People who disagree with their narrative \(on betrayal by the establishment, or anything else\) should challenge, rather than condone, it.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.6. Con: The UKIP vote has [collapsed](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-general-election-ukip-why-collapse-matters-conservative-majority-theresa-may/), and three leadership elections since the referendum have [strained](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/21/ukip-leader-henry-bolton-says-party-could-collapse-if-it-ousted-him) the party's budget.  It is unlikely the party in its current form can regain the type of power it held before 2016.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.12.7. Pro: Immigration was less of an [issue](http://www.electionanalysis.uk/uk-election-analysis-2017/section-4-parties-and-the-campaign/why-immigration-faded-from-view-in-election-2017/) in election 2017 than it had been prior to the referendum. This was in part because many Leave supporters believed a Brexit deal would alleviate their concerns about immigration. Staying in the EU will rekindle the divisive politics of the referendum, as these betrayed voters would be drawn back to antiestablishment parties such as UKIP.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.13. Con: Opinion polls indicate that the public regrets the Brexit vote. A [YouGov survey](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/13/labour-flags-up-brexit-poll-which-suggests-public-regret-decision), this past October, found that only 42% of respondents think it is right to leave the EU, compared with 47% who think it is wrong. This is a shift since the referendum.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.13.1. Pro: Out of that 42% who still think it is right to leave the EU, not all of them would support a Hard Brexit.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.13.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.4.13.2.1.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.14. Pro: If Britain wants to trade with the EU, it will still be forced to follow EU trade regulations, but without any input on what those regulations are.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.14.1. Pro: It is usually more costly for a company to produce different versions of the same product to satisfy the rules of different export markets. This will mean that, on average, manufacturers wishing to export to the EU will have to produce their products to EU standards as a minimum. As a result, there will be no option for those companies but to follow EU standards and regulations even if the UK decides to change those rules.
1.10.1.4.1.4.3.14.2. Con: Only companies trading with EU will have to follow these regulations and only specific regulations will be applied. The UK is trading with the US but not all US regulations are part of the law in the UK.
1.10.1.4.2. Pro: In the UK, [32%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40192060) of MPs are women, whereas in the EU [37.4%](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/publications/2017/0001/P8_PUB%282017%290001_EN.pdf) of MEPs are women.
1.10.1.4.3. Pro: The UKs unadjusted Gender pay gap is [21%](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics).
1.10.1.4.3.1. Pro: The UKs Gender pay gap is the 4th largest in the EU, and is [higher than](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics) the EU member state average by 4.8%.
1.10.1.4.3.2. Con: Much of the purported gender pay gap is actually [due to part time work being less well paid \(per hour\) than full time work](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37198653), and women being disproportionately more likely to do part time work.
1.10.1.4.3.3. Pro: It would be hypocritical to leave the EU citing sexism as a reason.
1.10.1.4.4. Pro: Gender inequality is a global problem, as measured by the UNDPs [Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii).
1.10.1.5. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.
1.10.1.6. Con: MEP selection is made by the party being voted for by the electorate as elections are conducted using the proportional representation system. This means if someone votes for Labour, for example, the Labour Party allocates the candidate. Lack of diversity is therefore down to who the parties put up, rather than the EU as an organisation.
1.10.1.7. Con: Ethnic diversity doesn't just include different skin colours. There are at least 28 \(but undoubtedly more\) different ethnicities in the Commission and Parliament.
1.10.1.8. Con: Positive Discrimination Targets as inherently demanded in the question are in general not a healthy way to target discrimination - as they are necessarily discriminatory themselves. Equality of opportunity, not of outcome, should be the goal. This is the path to a meritocracy.
1.10.1.9. Con: [8%](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01156) of MPs are from ethnic minority backgrounds, compared to 13% of the general population. The UK itself lacks diversity in representation.
1.10.2. Con: The EU has been a driver of equality policy in Europe.
1.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.10.2.2. Pro: The UK has introduced many of its equality measures as a result of EU initiatives.
1.10.2.2.1. Pro: The Equality Act 2010 is the piece of UK legislation which protects people in the workplace and wider society from discrimination on various grounds \(including age, disability, race and sexual orientation\). It [implements four major EU Equal Treatment Directives](https://rightsinfo.org/10-times-european-union-made-difference-human-rights/).
1.10.2.2.1.1. Con: The UK may have created the same rules as the four "Equal Treatment Directives" by themselves, if the EU had not made them first.
1.10.2.2.2. Con: The UK is heavily represented at the EU, and played a key role in the drafting of these equality measures. In the vast majority of cases, the UK would likely have drawn up similar protections had it been outside the EU.
1.10.2.2.2.1. Con: Whilst the British Government seeks to replicate most EU laws for ease of trading, it refuses to protect EU laws on human rights, offering '[basic rights](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-mps-vote-against-including-european-fundamental-rights-charter-in-uk-law-a8162981.html)' instead.
1.10.2.2.3. Pro: The British [Equality and Human Rights Commission](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/about-us/who-we-are) claims that [EU law has led to changes in UK law](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-human-rights-work/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-uk), which protect equality and human rights. These include data protection, human trafficking, disability rights, workplace discrimination, and equal pay.
1.10.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.
1.10.2.4. Con: The UK consistently has the lowest rates of discrimination across the EU, showing that it is not the EU per se that should take credit for high equality, but rather British governments, courts and society in general. See e.g. [figure 5 here](http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2017-eu-midis-ii-main-results_en.pdf)
1.10.2.5. Con: It is the [UK that has been a driver](https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-diversity-exits-the-eu-brussels/) of equality policy in the EU, not the reverse.
1.10.2.6. Pro: The UK has strong equality policies.  By being part of a larger community it can push those policies even further, to affect more people.
1.10.2.6.1. Con: The UK can lead by example just as effectively, if not more effectively, outside the EU where it is not seeking to impose laws on other countries.
1.10.2.6.2. Con: Even if it were true that the UK wants to push equality policies further, and given the [backlash against political correctness](https://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/martin-townsend/772180/trevor-phillips-political-correctness-documentary-channel-4-gone-mad) this is unsubstantiated, it is not at all clear that the UK should seek to legally impose those policies on other countries.
1.10.3. Con: The EU commissions senior management is [35% female](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-4778_en.htm), and 37% of middle management is female.
1.10.3.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.2.
1.10.3.2. Pro: The EU launched a new “[Diversity and Inclusion Charter](https://www.eubusiness.com/topics/employment/diversity-inclusion/)” in 2017 with promises of fresh action to reach at least 40 per cent women in its management by Nov 1, 2019.
1.10.3.3. Pro: This is [higher than](http://www.cityam.com/260427/number-uk-senior-business-roles-held-women-has-fallen-says) the UKs \(falling\) average of 19% in senior roles, and the global average of 25%.
1.10.3.3.1. Con: Comparing the EU bureaucracy to private companies is inappropriate.
1.10.3.3.1.1. Pro: The EU bureaucracy passes and upholds laws on gender equality, and so should be expected to "practice what it preaches" and achieve higher gender equality than private companies do.
1.10.3.3.2. Con: The UK’s civil service has [40% women](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/civil-service-gender-balance-2016) in the most senior roles and over 45% in the next most senior roles.
1.10.3.4. Con: -> See 1.10.3.3.2.
1.10.3.5. Pro: This is higher than the worldwide average for parliaments \([22.8% as of June 2016](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures)\).
1.10.3.6. Pro: This is higher than the Fortune 500 average of Female Senior managers \([20.5%](http://fortune.com/2017/06/09/white-men-senior-executives-fortune-500-companies-diversity-data/)\).
1.10.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.10.3.3.1.
1.10.4. Pro: The European Council \(made up of the leaders of the 28 EU member states\) is just 10% female \(UK, Germany, Lithuania\), whereas the UK cabinet is much more progressive with [30% female members](https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers).
1.10.4.1. Con: The EU parliament, with [37% female MEPs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/publications/2017/0001/P8_PUB%25282017%25290001_EN.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi839LO26rhAhVTURUIHSOGCHIQFjABegQIBxAF&usg=AOvVaw1wO3RKXF0wohqUqYJmc5Zg&cshid=1553978160967), is more progressive than the house of commons, with only [32% female MPs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom).
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: The Conservative party, the biggest single group in the house of commons, has the lowest female representation of all parties excepting the DUP.
1.10.4.2. Con: Both are far from exemplars of progressivism, with a lower ratio of women in leadership positions than in backbench positions-- [EU](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/publications/2017/0001/P8_PUB%25282017%25290001_EN.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi839LO26rhAhVTURUIHSOGCHIQFjABegQIBxAF&usg=AOvVaw1wO3RKXF0wohqUqYJmc5Zg&cshid=1553978344485) / [UK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom)
1.11. Con: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.13.5.
1.12. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.4.1.4.3.
