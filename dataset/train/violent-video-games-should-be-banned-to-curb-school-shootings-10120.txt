Discussion Name: Violent video games should be banned to curb school shootings.

1. Violent video games should be banned to curb school shootings.
1.1. Pro: The measures currently in place to prevent children and teenagers from accessing violent, age-restricted games are ineffective. Only an outright ban would prevent children getting access to them.
1.1.1. Pro: Filesharing platforms allow everyone with basic computer skills to access video games without any restrictions or age verification mechanisms.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is difficult to enforce laws on filesharing websites. Online piracy is still [rampant](https://dataprot.net/statistics/piracy-statistics/)(Illegal downloading of copyrighted materials takes up 24% of the global bandwidth.), and it is likely that these filesharing platforms would remain active, ban or not.
1.1.2. Pro: Video game age classification systems are ineffective and confusing.
1.1.2.1. Pro: ESRB ratings do not have legal effect, but are rather intended to [inform parents](https://www.esrb.org/)(ESRB ratings provide information about what’s in a game or app so parents and consumers can make informed choices about which games are right for their family.), who can then choose what their children play.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Even then, they aren't very effective, as violent multiplayer games like Call of Duty still have major audiences that are minors.
1.1.2.2. Con: PEGI age ratings are legally enforceable, and [prohibit retailers from selling games to those below the rated age](https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/parents/articles/gaming-whats-appropriate-for-your-child/)(Yes - in the UK, the PEGI 12, 16 and 18 ratings are legally enforceable. This means that retailers cannot sell or hire these games to those below these ages.).
1.1.2.2.1. Con: This does not stop someone older from buying games for those who are under the age classification.
1.1.3. Pro: Popular online shops such as Steam have [no effective system for age verification](https://www.agechecked.com/adult-only-games-in-germany-blocked-by-steam/)(The current age verification system in place on Steam simply involves players entering their date of birth when signing up. This system is not sufficient enough to prevent minors from accessing the adult-only content that is available on Steam.).
1.1.3.1. Pro: Some platforms, such as Steam operate on a trust system, where they rely on users to input the correct information. A far more effective system could include verifying information by requiring a personal ID to be accessible.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Physical ID verification still can be circumvented if a legal adult had their ID set up for the minor.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Pretending to be another person online strays into the realm of fraud and impersonation, and is already illegal. This should discourage children from this tactic.
1.1.3.2. Con: There is no easy way to prove your age and identity online, and it would be trivial for a minor to acquire his parents' identification.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.3.3. Con: Setting an account with Steam as a parent [makes is possible](https://www.bark.us/guides/gaming-steam/) to restrict the access.
1.1.4. Con: These measures could be tightened through stricter regulation before a complete ban is taken into consideration.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Age-verification measurements as an alternative to an outright ban have been effective for other products, such as alcohol.
1.1.5. Con: The measures currently in place may be ineffective in limiting access to violent video games, but this does not necessarily imply that limiting access to violent video games would also reduce school shootings.
1.1.5.1. Con: Violent video games have been shown to [increase aggression](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2000/04/video-games)(Playing violent video games like Doom, Wolfenstein 3D or Mortal Kombat can increase a person's aggressive thoughts, feelings and behavior both in laboratory settings and in actual life, according to two studies appearing in the April issue of the American Psychological Association's \(APA\) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Furthermore, violent video games may be more harmful than violent television and movies because they are interactive, very engrossing and require the player to identify with the aggressor, say the researchers.). This increased aggression could ultimately lead to the planning and execution of a school shooting.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Men who are [already inclined towards aggression are particularly vulnerable](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2000/04/video-games)("One study reveals that young men who are habitually aggressive may be especially vulnerable to the aggression-enhancing effects of repeated exposure to violent games," said psychologists Craig A. Anderson, Ph.D., and Karen E. Dill, Ph.D. "The other study reveals that even a brief exposure to violent video games can temporarily increase aggressive behavior in all types of participants."), which may lead to bullied or outcast school members to become even more aggressive, leading to a school shooting event.
1.2. Con: A government ban can have unintended consequences; therefore, such a ban would not be legitimate.
1.2.1. Con: Governments often prohibit certain behaviours or products in order to avoid undesirable outcomes. Violent video games are no different.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Many dangerous drugs are illegal, and helpful drug usage is heavily monitored and regulated by governments across the world.
1.2.1.2. Con: The banning of widely popular products for these purposes generally fail, like the [prohibition of alcohol in the US](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/alcohol-prohibition-was-failure#)(National prohibition of alcohol \(1920–33\) — the “noble experiment” — was undertaken to reduce crime and corruption, solve social problems, reduce the tax burden created by prisons and poorhouses, and improve health and hygiene in America. The results of that experiment clearly indicate that it was a miserable failure on all counts.).
1.2.1.3. Con: It is likely that the banning of video games will follow a different agenda, such as oppressing minorities.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [The US war on drugs was created just to help increase hate on minorities](https://www.blackagendareport.com/content/war-drugs-war-minorities).
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Many members of the US government who hate the Muslim minority will likely try to use violent games to support their agenda, as games supposedly are the cause of many kinds of violence.
1.2.2. Con: It would be impossible for a government to consider every possible consequence of an action before taking it.
1.2.2.1. Pro: There will always be the potential for unintended consequences to every action. If a government was forced to consider every possibility, it would cause legislative gridlock.
1.2.3. Pro: A governmental ban on the violent game market would likely introduce a monopoly to the AAA game market, as Nintendo is the only major AAA company to make games marketed towards young audiences and families.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Nintendo games consoles, such as the switch, [already rely heavily upon first party titles](https://www.businessinsider.com/nintendo-reliance-on-first-party-games-huge-risk-to-business-2019-2?r=US&IR=T)(Just about 85% of Nintendo Switch software sales are first-party games — games made and/or published by Nintendo.). Therefore the banning of violent video games would not have as great an effect on Nintendo as it would other console makers.
1.2.3.2. Con: A governmental ban may still effect many Nintendo titles, as many contain [cartoon violence](https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/)(Violent actions involving cartoon-like situations and characters. May include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted.).
1.2.4. Pro: A complete ban is impossible to enforce effectively. It would just create a black market for these products.
1.2.4.1. Con: Black markets tend to lead to an increase in prices of products. This would make them less accessible to children.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: As seen before with black markets, these products can still surface in areas for minors, and in many cases, minors can still get their hands on them.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Minors can barter for illegal products to obtain them.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: School children are already known to trade their belongings like [NBA cards](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/sports-cards-gone-virtual-big-way-rcna573)(“I’m not going to lie, it makes me feel like I’m a kid again,” Orlando Magic guard Terrence Ross said. “At lunch, at school trading NBA cards -- it’s fun.”) and [lunch](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1aShwBP_R4oC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=trading+school+lunch+for+baseball+cards&source=bl&ots=nUnmEGZ9XS&sig=ACfU3U3RCYd1pT5PLwqrd9IeHYhI9POetg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiclJ_u0qH2AhWgILcAHQaGBjgQ6AF6BAhUEAM#v=onepage&q=trading%20school%20lunch%20for%20baseball%20cards&f=false). They could do the same for violent video games, if they are prohibited from playing them.
1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: Just blocking access for minors does not mean that adults can act as a buffer for a minor to obtain the product.
1.2.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: There have been reports of adults buying products like tobacco and alcohol for teenage minors.
1.2.4.1.1.3. Pro: Not all adults are good at making sure their illicit goods are kept away from their children, which can lead to said children gaining access to these products.
1.2.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: The invention of child-proof containers had to be made since little kids kept on accessing and even consuming the contents of these containers, many of which are lethal.
1.2.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: This however did not stop older minors \(13-18\) doing stupid things, such as consuming tide pods and stealing medications.
1.2.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: In many cases, an adult will leave something that a minor shouldn't have out in the open, whether intentional or not, the minor can gain access to this product.
1.2.4.1.1.4. Pro: Just as some drug dealers intentionally deal to minors due to how quickly the under-developed human body can get addicted to these drugs, some game developers purposefully market their violent games towards a young audience.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1. Con: There are still drug dealers with some form of moral code, such as do not deal drugs to minors, though often this devolves into the dealer providing fake drugs.
1.2.4.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: It is often made fun of how much dealers just sell minors ground oregano instead of marijuana.
1.2.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Violent games like Fortnite are [designed to be addictive to children](https://nypost.com/2018/06/13/fortnite-designed-to-be-addictive-for-kids/)(Playing video games has a physical effect on the body, causing chemical changes in the brain too.\n\n“Video games such as Fortnite are designed to be addictive — they give children a hit of dopamine — also known as ‘the reward hormone,'” says parenting expert O’Shea.\n\nDopamine is the same chemical that floods into the brain when people win at gambling, smoke a cigarette or do a line of cocaine.), and are [marketed towards children](https://battlefieldsports.com/blog/the-rise-of-fortnite-kids-influence-in-marketing)(This finding is not unique. A 2019 survey of 1,500 people in North America by the National Research Group discovered that Fornite is offering brands access to significant young audiences who watch less traditional TV, Fortnite is changing the way consumers and brands are interacting and opening up new opportunities for live experiences. In fact, they found that two in three tweens say they are playing more Fortnite this year than they did last year.).
1.2.4.2. Con: Partial bans, such as age restrictions, are [successful](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/19/10761802/drinking-age) and easy to enforce.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Enforcing age restrictions online is a practical impossibility.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Banning violent games won't do anything positive for those who already own violent games.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: If violent games were treated like the illegal narcotics within the US, private property of millions would be invaded and likely even destroyed to grab these games.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Banning violent games can lead to billions of dollars lost from owning games without reimbursement for turning in physicals.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: With reimbursement, game publishers could be the ones losing billions, causing a crash of the gaming market as a whole, especially for companies that have titles that contain content with payment barriers.
1.2.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: The biggest hits from this would include Halo Infinite, COD WZ, Fortnite, and Battlefield 1, cumulating in ~$18.5B in damages for just these 4 games.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Even if a country like the US would ban violent video games, they would still be sold in other countries and be accessible via the internet.
1.2.4.5. Pro: Not all violent games will be successfully removed, as there are more than 10x the human population just in physical copies of FPS games alone.
1.2.4.6. Pro: An outright ban on violent video game is unconstitutional. The government lacks the authority to prevent people from purchasing these goods on First Amendment grounds.
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: California tried to regulate violent video games, but [the Court ruled the state law unconstitutional](https://www.rcfp.org/journals/regulation-violent-video-games/).
1.2.4.6.2. Con: The [Commerce Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause) gives the government the ability to regulate interstate commerce, which provides the federal government the authority to ban these products if it so chooses,
1.2.4.7. Con: A complete ban, even with a small black market, would still be generally effective in keeping violent video games out of the hands of children.
1.2.4.7.1. Pro: Having to purchase violent video games on the black market would likely be difficult and risky enough to discourage enough children from doing so.
1.2.4.7.2. Pro: A complete ban would make it impossible for adults to purchase a violent video game legally within the country and give it to a younger person.
1.2.4.8. Pro: There is the issue that the games can be found on the internet or bought via international sources. Banning the games themselves would do nothing more than anger many consumers and possibly shut down the gaming market as a whole.
1.2.5. Pro: The government will inadvertently cast too wide of a net, or miss something critical, and hurt consumer choice.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Much of the video game industry relies on the production of violent video games. Banning them could collapse in the game market.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: As seen before, an action in 1 market may also harm another, and in this case, people may end up working to also ban other forms of media that include violence, thus leading to damages across the entire media market.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: Disney's big franchises, Marvel and Star Wars, include violence in order to help tell their stories, banning said stories can kill at least 2/3 of Disney's revenue.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: ViacomCBS owns major IPs, including Star Trek, thrusting the removal of the violence in these IPs will lead to financial ruin for this company.
1.2.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: The new possible cash cow for ViacomCBS, Halo, could instantly be dropped with the ban of violent games, as the show is designed to help market the game franchise in some capacity.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: There are many indie developers that have made games with some form of violence, like King Arthur's Gold or Robocraft, this can end up with closures to various studios dipping their toes into the market.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Small game projects such as Bit Assault and [Unwilling](https://amon26.itch.io/unwilling) won't be able to see any completion if violence in games are banned, thus stopping small developers from even getting started.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: If violent video games pose a risk to children, then it would be immoral to allow companies to make massive profits endangering children in our society.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Con: These companies do not market their games to young audiences though, especially thanks to the ESRB/PEGI rating system in place.
1.2.5.1.4. Con: A ban would force video game developers to be creative, and not to rely upon violence to enhance their products.
1.2.5.1.5. Pro: The main products of many large developers are violent video games.
1.2.5.1.5.1. Pro: Microsoft also holds a massive stake in the violent video game industry, 18 out of 25 studios in Xbox Game Studios are known for developing video games with some form of violence.
1.2.5.1.5.1.1. Con: Microsoft, as such a [large and wealthy corporation](https://www.forbes.com/companies/microsoft/?sh=37787dec73f7), would likely be able to survive the banning of violent video games.
1.2.5.1.5.1.1.1. Con: But with this ban, Microsoft will likely exit the entire gaming market for good, as [many of their most popular video game titles](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best_selling_Microsoft_games) are violent.
1.2.5.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Microsoft has [heavily invested in the Xbox brand](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/microsoft-expands-gaming-and-xbox-further-buying-activision-blizzard-for-68-7-billion/)(Though Microsoft has long been associated with its Windows and Office productivity software, the company has steadily expanded its efforts to lead the video game industry with its Xbox brand.), which caters to all genres of video games. Therefore, they it would be highly unlikely that they would simply leave the market.
1.2.5.1.5.2. Pro: Large game studio Rockstar has a long track record of only developing violent games, banning their only source of funding can immensely harm their market shares and lead to permanent closures.
1.2.5.1.5.3. Pro: EA holds the rights to many violent titles, such as Battlefield, Mass Effect, PvZ Garden Warfare, and Anthem. Losing the capability of developing for these franchises will slash EA's funding in half, possibly even more.
1.2.5.1.5.3.1. Pro: Plus, EA holds exclusive game development rights to the Star Wars franchise, and all modern SW games require some form of violence to be accurate, this can damage Disney's profit margins by a bit.
1.2.5.1.5.4. Pro: [Most, if not all of Sony's 1st party game devs produce violent titles](https://www.gamepur.com/guides/what-gaming-companies-does-sony-own), including Naughty Dog's Uncharted and Guerrilla Games's Horizon Zero Dawn.
1.2.5.1.5.4.1. Pro: Sony's most recent acquisition, Bungie, will be pretty much useless if the ban were to take effect now, as [Bungie has a track record of only making violent games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bungie_video_games#:~:text=Games%20%20%20%20Title%20%20%20,later%20releas%20...%20%2016%20more%20rows%20).
1.2.5.1.5.5. Pro: Activision Blizzard, a company with an income of [2.7 billion USD](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272334/activision-blizzards-annual-net-income/) relies upon violent IPs such as [Warcraft, Call of Duty and Overwatch](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/) for their popularity.
1.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.2.
1.2.5.3. Pro: The banning of violent games can lead to speculations in the game market, leading to games even with cartoon violence to possibly even take a hit in sales.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Nintendo is well known for producing games with cartoon violence, such as Super Smash Bros. and Super Mario Bros. Both of these franchises are likely to take a nosedive in popularity from the banning of these games.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: WB Games's project 'Multiversus' may be killed due to market speculation on both the developer's side and the consumer's side.
1.2.5.3.3. Con: Lawmakers are not without reason, and could make an exception for cartoon violence if it was deemed appropriate.
1.2.5.4. Con: Measures can always be adjusted after the implementation, thereby not causing any harm in the long run.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: Causing market uncertainty would make investing in video games incredibly risky and unattractive, thus harming the games industry.
1.2.5.5. Con: Consumer choice will always be hurt by a ban on something that is a consumer product. This is the cost of banning such items.
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: If the loss of some consumer choice leads to a decrease in school shootings, then that would be a positive deal.
1.2.5.6. Pro: America runs on the word of the law rather than the spirit, which leaves loopholes. There was a time when a toy company avoided paying a certain tax on X-Men figures by arguing that X-Men were [not humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Biz,_Inc._v._United_States).
1.3. Con: School shootings are not a large enough problem to justify a ban a very popular and common genre of media.
1.3.1. Con: The effect of school shootings are greater than just the direct deaths and injuries caused in an attack. School shootings have strong and deep effects across American society.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Fear of school shootings can disrupt feelings of safety and lead to the [development of anxiety and mood disorders in school children](https://www.psycom.net/mental-health-wellbeing/school-shooting-survivor-mental-health)(On a secondary level, the threat of mass shootings throughout schools is also damaging to mental health; safety and security are always paramount to a child’s healthy psychological development, and this constant anxiety and sense of danger will disrupt that sense of security, and put all children at risk of developing anxiety and mood disorders.”).
1.3.1.2. Pro: Fear of school shootings, as well as the necessity of school shooting drills can cause [anxiety and panic in the parents of schoolchildren](https://www.psycom.net/mental-health-wellbeing/school-shooting-survivor-mental-health)(Mass Shootings effect all of us, young and old. It’s so very important that we talk about these shootings openly and honestly with each other, and make sure that our children know they can come to us with any fears or concerns that they may be having as well. When schools have safety drills, make sure your children talk to you about them afterward, as these can be very scary as well. If you or your children are feeling anxious and panicked throughout the day, therapy can be a helpful, safe place to talk about these fears and to learn ways to stay more present and grounded in your everyday life.).
1.3.1.3. Pro: School shootings have become normalized in American society, causing a [dehumanization of victims and normalization of violence](https://theweek.com/articles/774000/how-america-normalized-murder-schoolchildren)(Our eyes are so accustomed to skimming documents of this sort that it is easy to forget just how ludicrous they actually sound. Here we have acts of almost unimaginable savagery reduced to a vague "incident," another "situation" that has mysteriously come into being. The words are dehumanizing to an extent that is almost impossible to convey. A person, or perhaps an animal, might be described as "active," but situations and incidents cannot be. Nor in any case is "active," which simply means engaged or ready to engage in some unnamed activity, anything like the right word for describing mindless violence. Goodness knows what is being papered over by "contained.").
1.3.2. Pro: More than [150 million](http://www.theesa.com/article/150-million-americans-play-video-games/) Americans play video games. Of those [75%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246715/share-of-violent-vs-non-violent-video-games-played-in-the-us/) say they play violent video games most often. This indicates that these people want to play these games and enjoy them. It is illegitimate for the government to take these games away from them.
1.3.2.1. Con: The wholesale enjoyment of violent video games is not a reason to keep them, but instead a sign of how big the problem is.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Any ban on such a widely-enjoyed genre of media would be deeply unpopular, and would likely be repealed upon a change of government.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Bans on widely popular products are rarely sustainable, as they lack popular support.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: The prohibition on alcohol in the United States was a failure, and ultimately [lost any support that it had and was repealed](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/prohibition-ends)(Prohibition, failing fully to enforce sobriety and costing billions, rapidly lost popular support in the early 1930s. In 1933, the 21st Amendment to the Constitution was passed and ratified, ending national Prohibition.).
1.3.3. Pro: [Mass shootings](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mass-shootings-are-a-bad-way-to-understand-gun-violence/) account for a tiny proportion of gun deaths in America. Of those mass shootings, school shootings make up an even smaller proportion. In reality, [a tiny number](https://www.dailywire.com/news/27209/how-many-children-died-school-shootings-2016-2017-daily-wire) of Americans die as a result of school shootings each year.
1.3.3.1. Con: There were [34 school shootings in 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2021/03)(There were 34 school shootings in 2021, 24 of which occurred after August 1. A shooting on Nov. 30, in which a student killed four people and injured seven at an Oxford, Mich., high school, was the deadliest school shooting since May 2018. As of the end of 2021, there were 92 school shootings since 2018.), which is nearly three per month. This is not an insignificant number, particularly within the context of the death, injury and fear caused by these events.
1.4. Con: Banning violent video games would only make them more exciting, acting as a 'forbidden fruit' for teenagers.
1.4.1. Pro: Raising the legal drinking age increases [underage drinking](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15008989_Reactance_theory_and_alcohol_consumption_laws_Further_confirmation_among_collegiate_alcohol_consumers), as predicted by reactance theory. These findings support the notion that forbidden fruits are particularly appealing to teenagers.
1.4.2. Pro: Teenagers are [naturally rebellious](https://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/emotions/teenagers/rebellion.shtml)(Rebelling in teenagers is often symbolic. They want to look grown up and impress their friends. If parents disapprove, it often makes teenage behaviour worse and arguments are common. They defy adult restrictions deliberately as a way of asserting their independence.), and will have a greater draw towards 'forbidden fruits' than children or adults.
1.4.3. Con: If violent video games were to be banned, their production would probably not be financially viable anymore. Thus, there would be no forbidden fruit to reach for.
1.4.3.1. Con: Users could still make violent games, via a black market to sell those titles, which can still be viable.
1.4.3.2. Con: This does not mean that pre-existing games will not vanish, teens will still be able to play copies of violent video games if they had them before the ban.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Video game technology [advances incredibly quickly](https://www.imageholders.com/insights/how-technology-has-influenced-the-gaming-industry/)(As technology has advanced, the thrill and allure of playing games has only increased, with more visual stimulus, creativity, and satisfaction.), and games quickly become outdated. It is unlikely that any child would want to play a game that is not current.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: There are still niche communities that are still interested in playing older titles, and if new violent AAA releases were banned, more people would look into playing these older games. [\[1\]](https://whatnerd.com/aaa-games-are-getting-worse/)
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: It is possible that graphics or gameplay mods could be developed by these communities in order to modernize older games, prolonging their lifespan.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Fans of the '90s classic DOOM and DOOM II constantly try to produce new content based on the game's code.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [John Romero recently made a new DOOM 2 level](https://www.thegamer.com/doom-2-john-romero-ukraine-charity-level/), which was made to help fund aid for Ukraine.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This was not part of continued support for the game, but rather was [John Romero's first addition to the game in 28 years](https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/doom-ii/doom-ii-new-level-for-ukraine/)(The level also marks Romero’s first addition to the game since its release 28 years ago.).
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [DOOM has been known to be ported to various platforms](http://retrooftheweek.net/p/181/why-does-doom-get-ported-to-everything-/), such as [Pico-8](https://www.bing.com/search?q=pico+8+doom&cvid=6f9b81de425e400bbf1b62d82f43d23a&aqs=edge.0.0j69i64.1825j0j1&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531&shtp=GetUrl&shid=aaa67915-e773-4c20-84f3-dccaecb69868&shtk=UE9PTSAtIEEgUmVtYXJrYWJsZSBQSUNPLTggUG93ZXJlZCA4LUJpdCBET09NIERlbWFrZSB3aXRoIENsYXNzaWMgVHVuZXMsIE1vbnN0ZXJzICYgR3VucyE%3D&shdk=UE9PTSAtIEEgUmVtYXJrYWJsZSBQSUNPLTggUG93ZXJlZCA4LUJpdCBET09NIERlbWFrZSB3aXRoIENsYXNzaWMgVHVuZXMsIE1vbnN0ZXJzICYgR3VucyEgUmVhZCBNb3JlICYgUGxheSBUaGUgRnVsbCBHYW1lLCBGcmVlOiBodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbHBoYWJldGFnYW1lci5jb20vcG9vbS1nYW1lLWphbS1idWlsZC1kb3dubG9hZC8%3D&shhk=CHHrFcONxqIdEQUU5g9wUkALhQq2lUUGrCU1LoIzMQc%3D&shth=OVP.ySmo6cJbfjl_v_dex_lU6wFoFo), [The Atari 2600](https://atariage.com/forums/topic/323152-doom-the-2600-demake/), [and the NES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzVN9kIUNxw).
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The love for DOOM is so great that getting it to run on non-conventional hardware has become a [popular internet meme](https://www.gamesradar.com/12-things-that-prove-that-doom-will-run-on-literally-anything/), with enthusiasts running the game on printers and calculators.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: In comparison to modern games, [DOOM and DOOM II are very small and simple, which makes modding and creating more content more accessible](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_engine)(In a more abstract sense, the Doom engine is the use of the Doom source code or the executable parts as a starting point for another game. This aspect is similar to the more novel concept of game engine, although the Doom games precede the concept and, while designed with greater moddability than many earlier FPS titles such as Wolfenstein 3D, the Doom engine differs from newer game engines in that it does not offer a definite core separated from the game-specific rules, and does not provide the greater degree of hardware abstraction newer engines may offer. It has provided developers an engine which is to be used as a modifiable example, rather than a multi-platform core to be used as a base.). This enthusiasm may not translate for more modern, complex games.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The DOOM engine, used in DOOM and DOOM II was designed for [greater modability than many other FPS games](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_engine)(designed with greater moddability than many earlier FPS titles such as Wolfenstein 3D...).
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The DOOM engine is so modifiable that it has been used for many retail and fan releases of [entirely different games](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_engine)(Aside from the seminal Doom games, the engine has been used for several commercial games:).
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: In 2020 Doom and Doom II received official updates which [added support for 60fps gameplay, quicksaves and other improvements](https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/9/21058815/doom-classic-update-60-fps-quick-saves-add-on-wads-sigil)(Doom and Doom 2 now natively support 60 fps on “all platforms,” Bethesda said on its website. That’s a big boost from the original 35 fps frame rate. Those games also have new quality of life features, including a “Quick Weapon Select feature, improved Level Select function, added Aspect Ratio and Brightness options, \[and\] a new split-screen HUD.” Players can also quick save their games by pausing Doom or Doom 2, then pressing R/R1/RB, depending on platform \(quick loads are performed with L/L1/LB from the pause screen\).).
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: It is possible that a ban could extend to such new mod releases, therefore stopping modders or publishers from abusing a loophole and modernizing older games.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This would be quite difficult to enforce, even with how strict Nintendo has been over their intellectual properties, there are still hundreds of modding communities for these games.
1.4.3.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: The PS1 hit Tomb Raider [recently had its engine become open source](https://github.com/XProger/OpenLara), opening the floodgates towards a revival for more modern custom engines to be operated with.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Older titles require older hardware to play. It is possible that many gamers do not want to purchase previous generations of console in order to play old games.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: This is why emulators exist, they both make the game available to play once more while on more recent hardware, and could be used to bypass any ban on violent video games.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: People often use [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)s [to play their favorite games](https://emulationstation.org/index.html), be it [custom arcade cabinets](https://www.instructables.com/Full-Size-Arcade-Cabinet-Using-Raspberry-Pi/), [reimagined consoles](https://experimentalpi.com/PiBoy-DMG--Kit_p_18.html), or just a cute little console on your desk.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Emulators are often used to facilitate illegal activity, such as the uploading and downloading of ROMS, [which is illegal](https://retrododo.com/are-emulators-legal/)(Downloading and uploading ROMs is illegal, however, so make sure you use your own game files. Retro Dodo does not condone downloading ROMs illegally.).
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: There however is a moral grey area in this legal stance, as many games are still played but not supported by their creators, therefore many consider pirating this game and many games in similar scenarios to be okay.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena:_Maze_of_Death) is currently [only available to play on a console that no-longer is in official active development](https://sega.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Gear), and thanks to [the studio that owns the license currently being shut down](http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Eden_Entertainment_Software), this game will never get any official port or re-release.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Super Smash Brother Melee still has an active and thriving [competitive eSports scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._in_esports), despite being released on the now-unsupported Nintento Gamecube in 2001.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.3. Con: In order to use emulators legally, [one must use their own game files](https://retrododo.com/are-emulators-legal/)(Downloading and uploading ROMs is illegal, however, so make sure you use your own game files. Retro Dodo does not condone downloading ROMs illegally.). This means that they still require old hardware, such as a game cart or disc.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Obtaining many of these old games will end up becoming very costly, [legitimately obtaining a functional copy of the NES game Stadium Events will cost the average consumer at least $8,000](https://moneyinc.com/most-expensive-nes-games-all-time/#:~:text=%20The%205%20Most%20Expensive%20%26%20Valuable%20NES,If%20playback%20doesn%27t%20begin%20shortly%2C%20try...%20More%20).
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: This is often why piracy is rampant, it exists for accessibility. Nobody would be capable of playing VirtualBoy titles if it weren't for piracy thanks to how much of a commercial failure the console was.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: If the second-hand market price of a game is too high, but demand is there, game developers will be encouraged to re-release the game to capitalise on the hype and offer an alternative to the second-hand market.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: This can be a problem for shut down studios, such as Eden digital or Bullfrog Studios, as the libraries of these dead studios will stay vaulted without piracy.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Purchasing a variety of older consoles in order to play specific games would be expensive and impractical.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Forcing gamers to purchase older consoles would likely lead to massive price inflation in the used hardware market, as there is a limited and often dwindling supply of these consoles.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Many console manufacturers have already re-released older consoles in order to capitalize on market demand. This could be used in order to circumvent a ban on new violent video game products.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Sony has released the [PS classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Classic), and Nintendo has released the [NES classic](https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/), devices that emulate older consoles and games.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: It is likely that any ban would also cover re-releases of violent content, thus closing this potential loophole.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: Video game consoles generally have a life span of [only 5 years](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-xbox-series-x-generation-lifecycle) before their successor is released. A ban would lead to a new generation of solely violence-free games which would run on the next generation of consoles in 5 years at most.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Parents have a role to play in the ban too. It would be the responsibility of the parent to ensure that their child is not consuming violent video games.
1.4.3.3. Pro: All video game developers would be forced to create non-violent games, thus quickly filling the market with competent, non-violent AAA titles.
1.5. Pro: Video games normalize and popularize violence in children, and affect how they see and interact with the world.
1.5.1. Pro: Video games depict killing and violence in a positive fashion, often rewarding players for it. Suffering is usually absent, and death is rarely more than a nuisance.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In many of the world's most popular games, such as Fortnite, Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, Call of Duty and Counter-Strike, killing other players is the only path to success.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Those games can be played in pacifist runs, where a user can't kill players or NPCs.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Pacifist runs are usually incredibly difficult to do, and may require that a player play the game in a way that was not intended.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The pacificst run of Bloodborne requires players to [abuse glitches and summons](https://www.thegamer.com/games-surprise-pacifist-runs/)(However, as speedrunners will tell you, you can absolutely conquer the treacherous world of Yharnam and beyond without killing a single soul using the help of unpatched glitches and summons.).
1.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many games, such as [Cyberpunk 2077 and the Metal Gear Solid series](https://www.thegamer.com/games-surprise-pacifist-runs/) require that the player kill certain bosses to continue, making it not a true pacifist run.
1.5.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Certain Halo games developed by bungie cannot be completed as a pacifist, even with skulls and bug exploitation, an example of this is Assault on the Control Room \(Halo 3\). [\[1\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8YKacEI-z0)
1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: The fact that many players choose not to do a pacifist run, despite one being possible, shows that it is not the video game itself that is violent, but rather the desires of the players.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: In many of these cases for pacifist runs, the player lives in the grey zone, and there are plenty of examples of games which require some intentional kills, such as boss fights.
1.5.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.2.1.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Incentivising violence towards others by requiring it to succeed is immoral, online and offline, and sets a bad example for children.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: These games also glorify conflict, violence and war by depicting it in a positive manner.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Video games have been accused of misrepresenting the reality of war by [failing to depict the struggles of regular soldiers](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-07-war-and-video-games)("If you are going into fetish-like detail about military buttons and great coats, then also show how cold the soldiers got, how hungry they are," he says. "Don't pick and choose just the bits you 'need.'").
1.5.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Veterans claim that while video games are good at [depicting physical environments, they fail to portray the emotional strain involved in war](https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/23/what-do-real-soldiers-think-of-shooting-games)(They explain that as much as they enjoy playing games, the real-life experiences are vastly different. And while games can be very good at portraying physical environments, they aren't even close to recreating the emotional strain of combat. Also, while games focus on the individual, real soldiers are trained to focus on the team.).
1.5.1.1.3.1.2. Con: The individual experience of each soldier would depend on their personality, deployment and background. It would be impossible to display an objective view of war from an individual level.
1.5.1.1.3.2. Con: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare depicts the horror of war [in a manner that only video games can](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/sep/19/war-video-games-hennessey-sicart)(In the first Modern Warfare there is a moment when the helicopter in which the player is fleeing is hit by the shockwave of a bomb, and it drops. Fade to black. And then fade up: the player recovers control of their avatar, and can crawl out of the debris, only to see devastation, and die. It's a powerful moment. Games excel because they involve the player actively. Films are not only passive, but also a medium of the last century: why should we trust them to tell a story about modern conflicts, which are so delocalised, so inhumane, so digital?).
1.5.1.2. Con: Many games have moved away from referencing death, and instead use more sports-like terms like 'elimination'. This contextualizes these actions into a more positive, sports-like frame.
1.5.2. Pro: Of the [ten best selling](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-10-best-selling-games-of-2017-revealed-in-the-/1100-6456205/) video games in the US during 2017, six have an exclusive focus on violence and killing.
1.5.2.1. Con: Popular games from the same year, like Breath of the Wild and GTA 5 have far considerable amounts of non-violent gameplay, including [exploration, puzzle solving, and survival](https://www.cbr.com/zelda-botw-design-exploration/)(Players can hunt for shrines or Koroks, go from encampment to encampment or boss to boss fighting, and hunt for better weapons. There are fields to comb through, forests to explore for ingredients to cook, animals to feed and much, much more. Breath of the Wild allows players to explore the game however they like, whether that's going to every tower or bumbling around in the dark, defeating the Divine Beasts or ignoring them to go straight to Calamity Ganon and hoping that stick you just found will be enough to take him down. The list of things to do is virtually endless.).
1.5.2.2. Con: Not all of those games have a direct focus on killing and violence.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: The lego games may have an aspect of violence in them, but they are normally used in a cartoony fashion, and also, you could play almost all of the lego games without needing to get a single kill.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: In the Viva Pinata series, players can kill a lot of creatures, but, it is in the destruction of toys, and that aspect is fully optional for players.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: The destruction of pinatas is normal in Latin cultures.
1.5.2.2.3. Pro: Breath of the Wild features killing, but it is for survival and nourishment. Plus, the game is more focused on puzzles than killing everything in your wake. You could even go for a mostly pacifist run if you wanted to.
1.5.2.2.4. Pro: The game series 'Portal' literally has a gun that users use to create portals to get around in a puzzle manner.
1.5.3. Con: There are many other sources of violent media available for consumption on the wider Internet and on TV. If violent video games were banned, all media depicting violence would have to be banned too.
1.5.3.1. Con: Children have no reason to seek out particularly violent content elsewhere. Video games are pernicious because they entertain children while simultaneously desensitising those children to violence.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Children who seek the thrill of violent content might as well seek it out elsewhere, for example in violent movies. Banning violent games would therefore not change anything.
1.5.3.2. Con: Video games uniquely allow young people to act out the violence in the story, which exacerbates the extent to which it is normalised for them. Alternative violent media is unlikely to have the same negative impact on their perceptions of violence that video games do.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Video games are always virtual, and do not depict real-life examples of violence. Gore videos or photos depict actual violence in a real-world setting.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: Advances in [photorealistic video game graphics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/12/future-of-video-gaming-visuals-nvidia-rendering) may create depictions of violence and environments that are indistinguishable from real-life.
1.5.3.4. Pro: From all times, history, mythologies, fictions, children games have contained violence. You can't expulse it from the children knowledge.
1.5.4. Con: The link between violent games and violent actions [has](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217305472) [been](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/08/592046294/what-research-says-about-video-games-and-violence-in-children?t=1530707009895) [refuted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952117300113?via%3Dihub) [repeatedly](https://www.apa.org/pi/families/review-video-games.pdf).
1.5.4.1. Pro: School shootings are the result of other factors that should be dealt with instead.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Most video games are available internationally, yet school shootings are mainly an American phenomenon, indicating that the mere existence of violent video games is not the source of mass-shootings.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Guns are easy to gain access to in the US. If this was not the case, there would be fewer mass shootings, regardless of the impact and influence of video games.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: California adopted policies that allow the government to remove guns from individuals [in crisis](https://www.csgv.org/issues/creating-evidence-based-policies/). Given that these individuals are the most at-risk for gun violence, even limited gun control can help reduce school shooting incidents.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: [Studies](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259) have shown that the way in which the media reports on school shootings results in a contagion effect, which means that more school shooting happen. The media should limit its reporting on school shootings and in particular, media should not name shooters.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: Another study has also suggested [that people are more likely to blame video games on school shootings](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/media/features/schoolshootingsvideogames.html) when the perpetrator is white.
1.5.4.2. Pro: According to a 2017, long-time exposure to violent video games is not linked to a "[desensitization on empathy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00650/full)."
1.5.4.3. Pro: When a shooter is white, it is [more likely that violent video games will be blamed](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/media/features/schoolshootingsvideogames.html)(Overall, this research seems to suggest that members of the media and political leaders seem to gravitate towards video games being the cause of the shooting when the perpetrator does not fit the image of a person who might not commit a violent act.\n\n“Media sources and audiences appear to be more receptive to alternate causes for mass shootings perpetrated by Whites than by members of minority groups,” says Markey. “Unfortunately, this disparity may have dire consequences, affecting not only perceptions of video games’ effects, but also reflecting disparities in the culpability we assign to criminals depending on their race.”) as a scapegoat. This implies a level of racial bias to the connection between violent games and shootings.
1.5.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.5.4.5. Con: The playing of violent video games has been linked with a [desensitization to violence and violent images](https://news.umich.edu/violent-video-games-desensitize-players-to-real-world-violence/)(“But this study is the first to link exposure to violent video games with a diminished reaction to violent images.”).
1.5.5. Pro: Developers of violent video games have [reported getting PTSD and having nightmares](https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691)(“I’d have these extremely graphic dreams, very violent,” ...\n\nEventually, the developer says they saw a therapist, who diagnosed them with PTSD. They attribute this to their work on MK11—not just the content of the game.) from their work. If it can effect grown adults who are creating these games, then it will likely have an effect on the young consumers of the product.
1.5.5.1. Con: Developers had to look at [background material and imagery that depicts real violence](https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691)(They told Kotaku that they had worked on the game throughout 2018, and spent their days reviewing violent animation work, discussing it with leads, sharing feedback with animators, and generally being surrounded by the kind of bloody real-life research material that creators reference in order to animate video game gore.) in order to develop the game. This would likely have a wholly different effect than simply playing a wholly fictional video game.
