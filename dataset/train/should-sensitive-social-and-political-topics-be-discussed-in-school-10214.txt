Discussion Name: Should sensitive social and political topics be discussed in school?

1. Sensitive social and political topics should be discussed in school.
1.1. Con: Most schools are government-run, which may limit the range of discussion of sensitive social and political topics.
1.1.1. Con: By this logic the constitution should not be taught in school, as it was designed to limit governmental powers, and provide methods to question itself. e.g. checks and balances between state and federal judiciary systems.
1.1.1.1. Con: The Constitution is well defined, written down and discussed by generations before. Emerging, sensitive topics are unidentified and hold more potential for alteration and interpretation. Thus, educational approach to sensitive social and political topics should be different than educational approach to Constitution.
1.1.2. Con: The topic is not solely about questioning government. "Sensitive social and political topics" has to include questioning those who question the government without facts or logic.
1.1.3. Con: The questioning of the government would happen in the classroom, with teachers. Teachers, while they may technically be government employees, are sufficiently removed from administrative bodies to not preclude questioning the government in this setting.
1.1.4. Con: Constitution protections can prevent deterrence of such questioning and remedy the situation on the rare occasion such questioning is discouraged.
1.2. Pro: It is important for students to have a comprehensive understanding of the world to properly navigate it as adults.
1.2.1. Pro: If children aren't taught how to approach sensitive social and political topics in an appropriate manner, they may fail to properly handle such topics when they become adults and the topics are more pertinent.
1.2.1.1. Pro: This can lead to social tensions as children fail to learn to be sympathetic towards experiences they cannot personally relate to.
1.2.1.2. Pro: When children are taught how to effectively deal with disagreements, discussing sensitive social and political topics can strongly aid in their personal development.
1.2.2. Pro: Educating kids at a younger age could decrease apathy towards politics at a later stage.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Students should have an understanding about how the government works and how to cope with it.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: People need to interact with their government at various point in their lives, such as for voting, getting any form of national or state-issued license, and doing taxes. Knowing how these work are essential to be a functioning adult.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Political apathy in the future may be avoided if children are given facts for both sides without bias
1.2.2.3. Pro: It also improves critical thinking skills which will allow children to form their own educated opinions later down the track.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: To be educated on a topic is not equivalent to having been taught to think critically on that topic.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Controversial topics are gateway to critical thinking.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Teaching politics in schools will give students a better understanding of the government and maybe inspire them to become politicians or work in politics.
1.2.2.5. Con: Educating kids could lead to feelings of anxiety and disenfranchisement that could result in increased apathy and disengagement from politics.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: [Evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/civics-education-helps-form-young-voters-and-activists/572299/) seems to suggest that, on the contrary, civics education is positively linked with voter participation.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: Research found that children who participated in the US Fast Track program \(designed to help at-risk children develop social skills\) had a greater [likelihood of voting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/08/17/a-political-scientist-has-discovered-a-surprising-way-to-increase-voter-turnout-it-starts-in-childhood/) later on in life.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: Cambridge Analytica's [DO SO](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2019/08/06/netflixs-the-great-hack-highlights-cambridge-analyticas-role-in-trinidad-tobago-elections/) campaign in Trinidad and Tobago was successful in generating voter apathy by stimulating feelings of disillusionment with the current government, resulting in[decreased voter](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/they-were-planning-on-stealing-election-explosive-new-tapes-reveal-cambridg/) turnout.
1.2.2.5.4. Con: Not educating children about the mechanics of how their country works is more likely to breed feelings of apathy, since they feel uninformed and powerless to make change.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Most [research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s002238161100034x?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) [supports](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4500183?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that [education](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-9477.12133) attainment is linked to higher political participation and engagement.
1.2.2.7. Con: Political apathy may be the result of political incompetency and bad political praxis. The school system should not carry that burden.
1.2.2.7.1. Con: Humans' nature is to err, politicians are human hence the incompetency and bad political practices will be present regardless. Learning to deal with it and learning how to build ones opinion in relation to these sensitive issues is exactly what the school system should be burdened with.
1.2.2.8. Pro: Understanding better how political institutions work is essential for a well-functioning democracy and it is in the interest of every citizen.
1.2.2.8.1. Pro: The [EU](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/education-or-indoctrination-eu-goes-to-school-to-get-message-out-1.2609547) has approved a resolution to [improve](https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/parliament-approves-report-teaching-eu-schools) education about how the union works in order to "bridge the long-standing gap between the European Union and its citizens and to restore their faith in the merits and necessity of the European integration process".
1.2.2.8.1.1. Con: Some politicians, especially in the UK, consider this proposal to [interfere](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/08/eu-trying-to-introduce-mandatory-classes-about-the-bloc-into-sch/) with in each countries' sovereignty regarding education.
1.2.2.9. Con: Apathy towards politics is not something that needs to be corrected.
1.2.3. Pro: In our days, because of the free and easy information its impossible to keep children away from some sensitive topics. There is no better way to learn how to cope with them than the orderded discussion in school where they can see both sides and different arguments than those in their family environment
1.2.3.1. Pro: Family environments are often very [hierarchical](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Roles-Within-the-Family.aspx)(In most families parents are expected to be the leaders or executives of the family; children are expected to follow the leadership of their parents. As chil­dren in the middle years grow older, they will ask for, and certainly should be allowed, more autonomy, and their opinions should be considered when deci­sions are made; however, parents are the final authorities.), and it is possible that children wouldn't feel free to express themselves at home like they would in school.
1.2.3.2. Con: Entrusting schools with the discussion of sensitive topics leaves children at the will of their teachers, who might have views that do not align with the values of a child's family.
1.2.4. Con: Children often struggle to take in more nuanced and complex perspectives. Attempts to discuss politics can backfire and lead children to make extreme conclusions or fail to learn anything and instead simply leave them confused.
1.2.4.1. Pro: This means that in order to avoid children from making very extreme conclusions, the teachers are often forced to tell them how to interpret different political perspectives, which would lead to their own political biases having too great of an influence on the children's ability to form independent political views.
1.2.5. Pro: Teaching children this will cause them to be more open minded and less susceptible to political bias, if taught correctly.
1.2.6. Con: Sensitive politics can only be followed by a complete understanding of civics. Basic civics is generally [not being taught](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/01/us/civics-class-action-lawsuit-rhode-island/index.html) in school so sensitive political topics will only confuse an ill-prepared student.
1.2.7. Pro: Critical thinking, forming arguments, and exploring new topics should be a central pillar to an education system.  All of these things are rooted in discussions around sensitive and political topics.
1.2.7.1. Pro: School debates on sensitive topics could build a culture of rational tolerance, where people discuss things by their rational value, understanding the implications of both their own and others arguments.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Discussing sensitive and political topics in school can teach students to advocate their beliefs in an effective manner, to empathise with another opinion, to see grey areas and understand compromise. These are valuable life skills for any person, and will especially benefit students who are not taught this at home, making them less vulnerable to propaganda and giving them the resources they need to advocate for themselves.
1.2.7.3. Con: Students are not currently taught the critical thinking skills that are necessary for successful nuanced discussion. Because of existing habits, any sensitive topics discussed will be learned as rote & memorization- rather than thoughtfully considered.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: Such topics could be preceded by direct critical thinking skill education.
1.2.7.3.2. Con: Discussion of these subjects could be utilized as a pathway through which to learn critical thinking skills.
1.2.8. Con: Discussion of sensitive topics could make students of opposing opinions [more extremist in their views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization).
1.2.8.1. Con: Extremist views are largely formed by people not being exposed to the other side.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Many far right American nationalists have never actually [met the various minorities](http://fuuse.net/white-right-meeting-the-enemy-fuuse-film-deeyah-khan/) they stand against and there are many cases where they change their views after meeting and befriending those people.
1.2.8.2. Con: Discussing these topics in school helps to confront extremist views and false news.
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: Teachers can teach their students [resilience to avoid extremist views](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/182675/DFE-RR119.pdf). \(p.5\)
1.2.8.3. Pro: Discussion of sensitive topics could lead students [to explore the subject further on the internet](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR400/RR453/RAND_RR453.pdf), which could increase the chances of radicalization. \(p.6\)
1.2.8.3.1. Con: The Internet is ripe with information that shape children's understanding around sensitive topics. Teaching such topics in school will at least [prime students to explore](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03755-2)(The roots of the priming phenomenon go back to the 1970s, when psychologists showed that people get faster at recognizing and processing words if they are primed by related ones. For instance, after seeing the word ‘doctor’, they recognized ‘nurse’ faster than they did unrelated words. This ‘semantic’ priming is now well established.) the Internet with a given perspective.
1.2.8.4. Pro: A classroom discussion on a sensitive topic could also lead to tribalism, where both sides of a debate become more extreme, and begin to identify with their opinion. This would be harmful to educational outcomes.
1.2.9. Pro: Students should be provided with discussion and facts before they decide on a particular view that they may hold for the rest of their lives.
1.2.9.1. Pro: [Most kids](http://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx) are likely to simply take on their parents' political views. Learning about it in school makes it possible for the children to make their own minds up.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Either the teacher has a different bias as their parents or peer group or the same one. So either they are confronted with a different perspective, which is always good, or it does not matter.
1.2.9.1.1.1. Con: A child surrounded by multiple sources of a bias is more likely to be affected than a child with only one source of that bias.
1.2.9.1.2. Pro: When teachers discuss politics with children they do so in a professional and monitored environment, where they can be held accountable. The same is not applicable to parents.
1.2.9.1.3. Pro: Political science and public policy research points that "[voting habits](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/well/family/what-really-makes-us-vote-it-may-be-our-parents.html) are formed in childhood and adolescence".
1.2.9.1.4. Pro: Teachers can also receive [training](http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/teacher_in_a_strange_land/2018/04/bias_in_education_world.html) in recognizing their own biases and thus [mitigating](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/childrens-rights/articles/2017/fall2017-how-implicit-bias-impacts-our-children-in-education/) its effects.
1.2.9.1.4.1. Pro: The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards offers multi-day [bias training](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1110900.pdf) for teachers seeking National Board Certification.
1.2.9.1.5. Con: While this may be true, it is a bad thing because teachers are biased toward Left-leaning policies.
1.2.9.1.5.1. Pro: According to [surveys](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/12/13/survey-paints-political-portrait-of-americas-k-12.html), in the US teachers tend to lean left-wing and be more supportive of the Democrat party.
1.2.9.1.5.1.1. Con: Despite that, the teachers surveyed present a very common and [representative](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/) [distribution](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/12/13/survey-paints-political-portrait-of-americas-k-12.html): a majority classify themselves as moderate \(43%\), followed almost equally by liberal or conservative \(24% and 23%\) and only 5% and 4% very liberal or very conservative.
1.2.9.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The same survey stated "Half of all educators report voting for Hillary Clinton in the most recent presidential election while nearly a third \(29 percent\) voted for Donald Trump; 13 percent selected a third-party candidate; and 8 percent did not vote. " demonstrated that irrespective of how they claim they are [63% voted for Democrat](https://www.edweek.org/media/educator-political-perceptions-education-week-12-12-2017.pdf) or radical candidates.
1.2.9.1.5.1.2. Con: The same survey asserts that [65%](https://www.edweek.org/media/educator-political-perceptions-education-week-12-12-2017.pdf) of teachers to some extent avoid political activities to avert problems with their education jobs.
1.2.9.1.5.1.3. Pro: When combined with teacher tenure that prevents bad teachers from being eliminated, the risk is high that [bias](http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/) will warp young minds.
1.2.9.1.5.1.4. Pro: There is evidence to suggest that there is a liberal bias in how politics is being taught at a US high school, which has left children who hold minority political views feeling alienated.
1.2.9.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: A [poll](https://waylandstudentpress.com/57896/articles/opinion-there-is-liberal-bias-at-wayland-high-school/) has found that "54% of students with a minority political view felt that their views are not well represented in the school, and about 1 out of 3 of these students felt scared to share their views in the classroom because they feel that students and teachers would judge them."
1.2.9.1.6. Pro: Parents are even more likely to create a bias in their children, than teachers.
1.2.9.2. Pro: Students should be informed in order to acquire a critical perspective on society. Understanding problems is essential to participate in society.
1.2.9.3. Pro: Teachers supervising debates can ensure that students support their arguments with evidence, leading to a more productive discussion of ideas than the students might find elsewhere.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: Discussing sensitive issues such as religion or politics in school may lead to less radicalization among the youth.
1.2.9.3.1.1. Pro: Teachers and expert in the UK point that, in order to prevent religous radicalization, [open dialogue](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/rules-extremism-teachers-pupils-spy-radicalisation-muslims-prevent) and discussion is better than monitoring which risks “alienating and isolating Muslim pupils, not protecting them”.
1.2.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Countering-Preventing-Radicalization-Education.pdf) suggests that "schools should be a forum in which values are questioned and openly discussed" s a way to prevent radicalization.
1.2.9.4. Con: People's views change as and when they meet new people, travel to new places and have new experiences. There is no reason to believe that people decide on their views while in school and stick to them forever.
1.2.9.4.1. Con: The parent does not argue that people decide their views and stick to them forever; rather, it argues that people should receive facts and be embroiled in discussion before they decide their views, which they might keep for all of their life.
1.2.10. Con: The world that children live in is just as real as the one adults inhibit. It's the perspective that makes a difference.
1.2.11. Pro: Only avoiding danger will not be indefinitely sufficient for a subject whose inherent drive is to explore.
1.2.12. Pro: Politics and other relevant social concerns should be taught at school because it is highly beneficial to make students knowledgeable of the current affairs while they are still young.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Young people [learn and change opinions more easily than adults](https://blog.library.tc.columbia.edu/b/10822-Do-Kids-Learn-Faster-than-Adults#:~:text=Kids%20learn%20faster%20than%20adults%20because%20the%20prefrontal%20cortex%20of,everything%20exactly%20as%20it%20is.), because the prefrontal cortex of the brain is more changeable.
1.3. Con: Discussing such things may cause a divide not only between students, but also between students and teachers.
1.3.1. Pro: Discussing issues like [politics](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/7/anti-trump-bullying-breaks-out-against-students-at/) can lead to bullying of children who are different from their classmates.
1.3.1.1. Con: Educating children about these differences will reduce bullying.
1.3.1.2. Con: Even though this may be true, in some circumstances, it can be completely prevented by the usage of anonymous methods of communicating ideas within said political topics.
1.3.2. Con: Students and teachers are already divided by a whole host of factors, it is unlikely that an additional factor will impact this divide meaningfully.
1.3.2.1. Con: An 'impact' is calculated locally \(by each one of us\). Every factor has equal potential until it's evaluated.
1.3.3. Con: If discussing these topics "cause\[s\] a divide," it must be because people hold different values and opinions. In other words, the divide already exists. Not discussing these topics just means we're refusing to acknowledge those differences and sweeping the division under the carpet.
1.3.4. Con: This depends on how the discussion is conducted. You could have everyone discuss things electronically, using anonymous accounts, if this is a major concern.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Anonymity takes away the fear of being attacked as an individual for own expressions.
1.3.4.2. Con: Anonymity abstracts the statement from its source, which may render it contextless and thus unclear.
1.3.5. Con: Being unable to understand alternate points of view on political stances leads to alienation on both sides. Therefore, the conflict among students or between students and teachers can actually be worse.
1.3.6. Con: Students in schools have different opinions already and discussing them would be better than just pretending that things like racism and sexuality don't exist because they will probably ask about those things later.
1.3.7. Pro: Some sensitive and political topics can make children feel ostracized [depending on their social and political background](https://theconversation.com/diversity-in-the-classroom-means-children-develop-differently-33899).
1.3.8. Con: Just because there "might" be a barrier between the teacher and student, this does not necessarily imply that schools should not emphasize teaching politics and social concerns. It is already anticipated that they will have divergent views.
1.4. Pro: School is the ideal setting for children to explore sensitive social and political topics.
1.4.1. Con: Discussing sensitive social and political topics in school does not meet the intended purpose of schools to benefit society's general welfare.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Discussing "sensitive topics" takes away time from being in core classes like science, math, English, and history.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Discussing sensitive topics can be integrated into core classes. History can discuss how the issues came about, English can discuss literary techniques used to support arguments for either side, and science and math can discuss the strength of the empirical evidence used to support either side.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Integrating sensitive topics into appropriate core subjects is likely to be an efficient means to teach students how to address sensitive issues within the most appropriate framework for reasonably and rational consideration. For example, sensitive scientific topics are best addressed within the framework of the scientific method.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Not allowing discussion of "sensitive" topics can prevent schools from covering the relevant topics.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: A thorough understanding of biology requires covering sexual reproduction and evolution, both of which are controversial for some people.
1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: English classes are sometimes prevented from teaching classic books because they cover controversial topics.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: The university is a better place and has more time and resources for non-core topics.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Even as of 2018, [about 2/3 of Americans have not attained a college degree](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/us-census-bureau-americans-are-more-educated-than-ever-before/4546489.html), indicating that reserving discussion of sensitive topics for university would leave out the majority of individuals.
1.4.1.1.4. Con: Ample time is already taken away from these "core classes" by other, less important classes, and understanding current situations could be argued as being just as important as the mentioned core classes.
1.4.1.1.5. Con: [History couldn't be properly taught](https://marblers2008.medium.com/can-we-teach-history-without-bias-db201eeb8638) without discussing some of the sensitive social and political topics that happened throughout time.
1.4.1.2. Con: The aim of school is "[to provide for the fullest possible development of each learner for living morally, creatively, and productively in a democratic society](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/journals/ed_update/eu201207_infographic.pdf)", therefore sensitive subjects need to be discussed in order to develop a morality.
1.4.2. Con: Politics shouldn't be discussed in schools because teachers may bias their students.
1.4.2.1. Con: Just because a teacher *might* include bias when discussing a political subject is not a valid reason to ban discussion on all politics.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: It is either impossible or utterly dehumanizing \(or both\) to sanitize a curriculum of everything that could potentially be a gateway to bias. We wouldn't want a society where nobody can exercise independent thought about anything even remotely controversial.
1.4.2.2. Con: Ideally, the role of a teacher would be to motivate students to debate among themselves and form their own opinions without any input from the teacher whatsoever.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: Eventually, teachers may express their own opinion on the topic, even if unintentionally.
1.4.2.3. Con: If teachers desire to bias students, they can and will do so, without explicitly mentioning the topics but just alluding to them and "bad arguments" of the other side. Thus better to have an open discussion where all sides are heard.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Teachers probably already bring up these topics here and there. But if teachers can only mention sensitive topics as an aside to the main lesson, they're going to have to keep that discussion very brief. There wouldn't be time or a process for them to present both sides fairly. Any exposure students currently get to difficult topics from teachers is likely only the view the teacher agrees with.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Without prior tutelage in critical thinking skills, students are not equipped to identify presuppositions and fallacies that are presented by teachers.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: This is asuming that the children will not be taught critical thinking skills before being given lessons on social and political topics, which is not necessarily true. Critical thinking skills can be included in the first part of curricula on sensitive topics.
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: Most secondary schools [don't start teaching how to identify bias](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliewexler/2018/11/05/how-schools-can-turn-kids-into-critical-thinkers-and-voters/#10b6c00d486b) until the last few years, if even then.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: Children are already given critical thinking skills, in age-appropriate ways even if not by overt critical thinking modules .
1.4.2.4.3.1. Pro: Children are taught the difference between a story and fact at early years \(at home or at [school](https://brookridgedayschool.com/teaching-children-difference-fantasy-reality/)\). Within stories, they might well be asked 'what would you have done?' ' Does that seem real?
1.4.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Around the [age](https://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/parenting-articles/imagination-and-creativity/fantasy-and-reality-does-your-child-know-the-difference) of three or four, most children are able to differentiate between reality and fantasy.
1.4.2.4.3.2. Pro: Without being able to differentiate between stories and facts, many topics would be ruled out. For example, religious elements, which in the UK is a [controlled subject](http://For example they are taught the difference between a story and fact at early years \(at home or at school\) . Otherwise many subjects would be taboo. For example all , constrained by law in the UK.), are predicated upon 'some people believe '.
1.4.2.4.3.3. Pro: [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3689871/) suggests that, when assessing reality status, "children are as likely to doubt as they are to believe".
1.4.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: In fact, "immature metacognitive abilities" seem to be the root of children’s skepticism, as they perceive they have limited knowledge to understand something, they overcompensate by evaluating more.
1.4.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.
1.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.5.1.
1.4.2.7. Con: Students will be more vulnerable to bias if they are not educated in politics. Civics education is important.
1.4.2.8. Con: Any good teacher \(or any professional, for that matter\) should be able to ignore personal biases in pursuit of performing his or her duties properly; in this case, a teacher should convey accurate historical information, objective science, and purely informational/unbiased news reports.
1.4.2.8.1. Con: Not all teachers are "good teacher\[s\]."
1.4.2.8.1.1. Con: Not all judges, not all policemen, not all politicians and not even all doctors are good professionals either, and there are mechanisms in place to check their performance, but that does not mean that all their vital functions need to be abolished due to some of them acting negligently or in bad faith.
1.4.2.8.2. Con: Personal bias can be notoriously difficult to identify and can be extremely subtle. This is why it has been evident in every profession. Therefore, it is unlikely that teachers are better placed to avoid it.
1.4.2.9. Con: Bias is not inherently bad.
1.4.2.9.1. Pro: Human emotions aren't always bad yet they are usually highly biased.
1.4.2.9.2. Pro: If one can agree on anything being good then bias towards that good thing would not be bad.
1.4.2.9.3. Con: The product of bias thinking is inherently bad with regards to critical thinking.
1.4.2.10. Pro: Teachers are regarded as an authority on the subjects that they teach, especially by younger pupils. As such, views supported by teachers could be seen as more valid by the pupils, thereby clouding their judgement.
1.4.2.10.1. Con: Teachers often share their feelings about politics on lessons. We can't stop that, but what we can do is to give children ability to find pros and cons of such worldview.
1.4.2.10.2. Con: Students should be educated of the subjective role of the teacher during political or social discussions as to prevent any misrepresentation of opinions as facts.
1.4.2.11. Con: Teachers can be held to be open about their own political bias and be required to remind students that they are allowed to disagree and when the teacher is leaving the realm of purely factual information and delving into their own opinion. This would also help students recognize bias outside of the classroom.
1.4.2.12. Con: It is against the law for teacher to talk about their religion or their political opinion to their students.
1.4.2.12.1. Pro: Under current doctrine, the anti-establishment clause of the [1st Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) of the U.S. Constitution [restricts](http://www.azpolicypages.com/religious-liberty/freedom-of-religion-for-teachers-and-professors/) teachers regarding personal religious opinion in the school environment.
1.4.2.12.2. Con: [In Canada, the only restrictions on teacher's freedom of speech are prohibitions against harassment, violent threats, insults, or hate speech.​](http://www.thecharterrules.ca/index.php?main=concepts&concept=2)
1.4.2.12.3. Pro: In the UK, Education Act of 1996 prohibits [political indoctrination](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/section/406).
1.4.2.13. Con: Any curriculum that addresses sensitive topics could be developed by a team that represents various points of view. People can work together to find a way to satisfactorily address sensitive issues for all parties.
1.4.2.14. Pro: When teachers bias their students, it can lead to angry parents demanding the firing of the teacher due to political activity. It puts teachers at too much risk.
1.4.3. Pro: Students will eventually get exposed to these sensitive topics later on in their lifetime. It's better to do it in a safe environment.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Life has sensitive and political topics. School supports children's development and dealing with life; there is no reason to hide them from the world they live in.
1.4.3.2. Con: The school environment is not necessarily safe; peers may still gang up on those with fringe opinions.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: School is safer than the real world, as teachers are present to moderate any conflicts that may arise.
1.4.4. Pro: Young people should have the opportunity to discuss issues that are important to them in a respectful, ordered environment.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Disagreeing civilly and respectfully is an important value to learn at school.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Schools are a safe environment, where students affected by discussions of sensitive topics can receive support if necessary.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Schools have employed [paedophile teachers](https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/orsp_shakeshaft_spring03.pdf) who could use topics based on sex to open inappropriate conversations with children in order to groom them.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: Teachers are [trained to share sensitive topics with their students](https://reliefteaching.com/managing-student-behaviour/sensitive-issues/) in an educational and constructive way.
1.4.4.3. Con: Children in Primary school do not typically care about "sensitive social and political" topics. Those topics are pressed upon them by biased educators.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: To generalize primary school students as uninterested in "sensitive topics" exaggeratedly simplifies the issue. [Each individual student's curiosity is motivated by countless factors unique to that child and their experiences.](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/why-young-children-are-curious/) The general claim, though may be true in select circumstances, cannot be held universally true in characterizing all classrooms. Simply put, this claim implies that all teachers are intentionally trying to confront youth with "sensitive topics" which is factually unfounded.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Sensitive social and political topics should be discussed in schools, but only under certain conditions.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: It's fine if the teachers asks permission from students first.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: If the topics are presented factually and without opinion, they should be discussed. The teacher could then facilitate \(without injecting opinion\) discussion among students, reminding them to be respectful at the same time.
1.4.4.4.3. Pro: Students should be given the right to discuss and research sensitive topics, including politics, in the education setting with the conditions, that: they be provided factual information, they be provided appropriate context, they be provided with an exceptional lessons concerning argumentation, they be given a connection to real life opinions and scenarios.
1.4.4.4.4. Pro: All sides of the issue must be discussed, showing pros and cons where the student presents their own conclusion using critical thought. Teachers are not allowed to overtly show their bias in topics. Teachers are facilitators of information and trainers of skill.
1.4.4.4.5. Pro: This should be taught in high school through a debatable process.
1.4.4.4.6. Pro: Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and procedural civility can and should be normalized, but "hard talks" need to be had.
1.4.4.4.7. Con: If teachers would be free to choose under which conditions sensitive social and political topics could be discussed, it could lead to [biased opinions from teachers](https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2018/8/1/teacher-bias-the-elephant-in-the-classroom).
1.4.4.5. Con: If sensitive and political topics are discussed in school, then free speech must be given to students, this includes what some people consider "hate speech."
1.4.4.5.1. Con: There would be no reason; indeed, it would be counter-productive to allow ad hominem attacks between students during a discussion of sensitive social and political subjects.
1.4.4.5.2. Con: Speaking freely does not imply that "hate speech" is used.
1.4.4.5.3. Pro: Children can often [inherit their parent's views](https://psmag.com/news/i-could-have-sworn-i-saw-dad-voting-for-dukakis) and, as such, the classroom may function as a platform for problematic opinions.
1.4.4.5.4. Pro: Classrooms are likely to be more politically correct than other public spaces, thus students run the risk of being ostracised for expressing their views.
1.4.4.6. Pro: Students experience these things first hand, despite many adults not wanting to talk to them about it. We should not let them be unprepared
1.4.4.7. Con: Black and white thinking is common in immature thinkers. As such, children are likely to have [more extreme views](http://www.strongbonds.jss.org.au/workers/youngpeople/thinking.html)("Black and white thinking" is a common manifestation of immature thought; thinking that is rigid, stubborn and often extreme, with few 'grey areas'. \n\n\[...\]\n\nImmature thought processes can often lead to family conflict. Parents can be particularly sensitive to the comments that arise from a lack of cognitive maturity, such as impulsive speech. They may take them more seriously than intended. They may think that the young person is being selfish or self-abs) and not express these sensitively.
1.5. Pro: Discussing sensitive topics may benefit the cognitive development of children.
1.5.1. Pro: Learning about these topics can open up new thought processes for children.
1.5.1.1. Pro: It would allow students to form their own conclusions, making them more confident in their opinions.
1.5.1.2. Pro: At a theoretical level, it allows open-discussion, as well as the ability to create individualized opinions.
1.5.1.3. Con: There is usually only one teacher, and at least two or more people are required to discuss authentic differing perspectives. Debate leads to critical thinking and is best done via the extracurricular debate team.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: Teachers can allow the students' to present their perspectives via in-class debate \(or out-of-class, as homework\), with the teacher or some invitee acting as a moderator.
1.5.1.4. Pro: These kinds of topics would prevent the students from being blinded by the current political environment and allow them to open their minds on issues and matters concerning this.
1.5.1.5. Pro: If young people don't learn how to debate and talk about sensitive topics in school, they might not learn this essential ability anywhere else.
1.5.1.6. Pro: School may be the only place students meet people with experiences and concerns vastly different to their own.
1.5.1.6.1. Pro: Families and other social groupings are often little more than echo chambers for ideas that a student has grown up with. Discussions at school present young people with personal perspectives beyond those of family, friends and their religious congregations.
1.5.1.6.2. Pro: By discussing topics that people feel sensitive about and weighing different perspectives on them, students may actually become less sensitive and irritable about those topics and feel more at ease with controversy and ambivalence in their lives.
1.5.1.6.3. Con: 79% of US primary school teachers are [of one policial side](http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/) as a result the students are being exposed to bias on sensitive subjects.
1.5.1.6.4. Pro: Discussing these topics in school could raise awareness, that way people may become more sensitive and caring to hear other's experiences/opinions.
1.5.1.6.4.1. Pro: Otherwise the richest educational experience becomes impossible when students do not possess as many of the facts on any given topic as possible.
1.5.2. Con: Children may not have the emotional or intellectual maturity to deal with some complex and nuanced topics.
1.5.2.1. Con: By avoiding talking about the most important issues in the world eg. gender because they are 'too sensitive' shields these children from the events happening in the real world. It is often ignorance and unawareness that lead them to make the same mistakes that cause these issues to arise, which they are prevented from learning about at school.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Prudently ensuring a child is capable of comprehending a topic before it is taught, is not equivalent to avoiding that topic entirely. Teaching something prior to the ability to comprehend may ingrain poor ideas and thinking.
1.5.2.2. Con: Children often lack the sensitivities of adults and thus are less likely to consider a topic "sensitive" to talk about.
1.5.2.3. Con: Discussing these topics will mature children and make them contemplate morals and form an opinion.
1.5.2.4. Con: Arguably, many adults also lack this ability.
1.5.2.5. Pro: In "[Politics in the Classroom](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-political-classroom-evidence-and-ethics-in-democratic-education_paula-mcavoy_diana-e-hess/9955057/item/26231503/?mkwid=M2bKtaS0%7cdm&pcrid=70112880312&product=26231503&plc=&pgrid=21323666712&ptaid=pla-365999968632&utm_source=google_shopping&utm_content=M2bKtaS0%7cdm%7cpcrid%7c70112880312%7cpkw%7c%7cpmt%7c%7cproduct%7c26231503%7cslid%7c%7cpgrid%7c21323666712%7cptaid%7cpla-365999968632%7c&gclid=CjwKCAjw1cX0BRBmEiwAy9tKHs0mflNX2ZWijSc54zoK7Cw3KPQr-f4ad7Q1IKqNq7NOCNiaimEwRxoCmuIQAvD_BwE#isbn=0415880998&idiq=26231503)" when children discuss various political views, some students break down crying. They just do not have the maturity and self esteem to handle different worldviews yet.
1.5.2.6. Con: Children are known to have high memory skills and a strong sense of empathy, suggesting they do in fact have the intellectual maturity to deal with sensitive topics.
1.5.2.6.1. Pro: The ignorance of education about the capacity of students to engage in important discussions leads to a lack of concerned and engaged citizens.
1.6. Con: Parents may not want their child to discuss sensitive topics in school.
1.6.1. Con: Sensitive topics must be taught to students, or else they form a false impression of the world as a place where "these things" do not occur.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Students will be unprepared to analyze and interpret events if they are taught to ignore them in public settings like school.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Students will be more likely to believe stereotypes, if they are not taught to tolerate differences.
1.6.2. Con: Sensitive social and political discussions should not be avoided for the sake of gratifying those who lack skills to handle them. These skills \(such as how to examine evidence, not taking it personally, see an issue from another's viewpoint\) should be taught and practiced at an early age so students are equipped to converse effectively when confronted with sensitive topics throughout their lives.
1.6.3. Con: The public school system guarantees that a child's education is completely independent from their parents.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Receiving education only in line with the parents enriches the ideology of the parents and creates an echo chamber effect, leaving no room to a different ideology that may be more appealing to the youth or even more correct.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Frankly any and every adult that a child meets exerts some effect upon them. All adults, parents and teachers especially, should cope well with questions like 'what is a harlot ?' a word which appears in the bible and other literature or 'if sex is nice why do I wait until I am 16 ? ' which many teenagers grapple with, during school studies and at home and in the media.
1.6.4. Con: Indeed they may not; but, perhaps such discussions should be held anyway. Parents' whims should be weighed against the costs of allowing them to keep their children in ignorance.
1.6.5. Con: The child parents can take their children to another school if they don't like the way the school deals with politics issues.
1.6.5.1. Con: If part of a national curriculum, parents may have very few or no other options.
1.6.6. Pro: Parents ultimately have both the right and the responsibility to determine what their children should know and when.
1.6.6.1. Con: Most [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education) have [compulsory education](https://education.findlaw.com/education-options/compulsory-education-laws-background.html) laws, which means the state can decide what and when children should learn.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: Many countries also allow [homeschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_international_status_and_statistics) as an option for parents who want to circumvent this.
1.6.6.2. Con: As a result of a revolution in technology, children are developing ideologies that differ from their parents, so they should have the opportunity to express and support that ideology independent of their parents or parental influence.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: The internet and mobile communications are 'enablers' but not causes. for ideological changes. Consider technology changes that have had ideological impact: Printing, then the electric light which enabled so much 'after work' self education, then the Radio and TV which shared world experiences and ideologies \(and new idols \), then Contraception and the Sixties, ....by comparison the changes over recent years \(though massive\) do not readily compare as 'causers' of sociopolitical change.
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: Children should not have reality \(and even Philosophical thinking \) hidden from them completely. Yes shield them from shocks; defer some knowledge and detail until it is appropriate for tem in their state of development. But censorship or banning of subjects is wrong for everybody.
1.6.6.3. Con: Parents do not have a censorship rights over their children. They may have an age-appropriate management function, but one which every educator would agree with. In general schools want to work with parents. [In the UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/sex-education-classes-school-parents-lessons-wales-lgbt-religious-a9138246.html) it is not in the parents' gift to arbitrarily remove kids from lessons that they, the parents, disapprove of, though until recently certain exceptions have been allowed.
1.6.7. Con: Parents' concerns could be relieved by teaching sensitive topics sensibly to reduce any damage to the children.
1.6.7.1. Pro: An example in the UK is Sexual education, which is taught only after a certain age is reached, with parental consent, and at a level appropriate for that age range.
1.6.8. Con: Surveys in the UK assert that [92%](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2017/11/10/survey-92-think-political-education-should-be-compulsory-in-scho/) think political education should be compulsory in schools.
1.6.9. Con: The definition of “sensitive” is purely subjective, and therefore all topics should be taught and debated in our schools including those that may evoke “sensitivity” in individuals or groups of individuals.
1.6.9.1. Pro: Responsible and open-minded teachers who are able to moderate unbiased discussions will show children that fear and incomprehension must be embraced instead of avoided.
1.6.9.2. Con: Teaching is providing a framework rather than its contents. A biased debate has the potential to further division instead of nourishing integrity.
1.6.10. Pro: Parents in many countries have the option of removing their children from classes that teach things they do not agree with or are given the option to sign up or sign out their children from some subjects. This could be easily extended to other sensitive topics.
1.6.10.1. Con: Removing a child from a course in school for any reason has a large, negative impact for that child with their peers causing unnecessary long term emotional damage.
1.6.10.2. Pro: In the UK parents can partially opt their children out from [Sex Education until age 16](https://humanism.org.uk/2018/07/19/uk-government-moves-to-give-young-people-right-over-sex-education-opt-out/), and [Religious Education until age 18](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects).
1.6.10.2.1. Con: Ministers in the UK have [declared it 'unlawful'](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/sex-education-classes-compulsory-parents-right-withdraw-children-laura-bates-justine-greening-sre-a7607981.html) for parents to remove their children from sex education classes.
1.6.10.2.1.1. Con: A recent move in the UK to make sex education compulsory stipulated that parents [still have the right](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/03/01/sex-education-will-compulsory-schools-combat-sexting-cyber-bullying/) to remove their children from these classes.
1.6.10.2.2. Con: Human rights bodies, lawmakers, and campaigners are [moving to remove this](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/sex-education-classes-compulsory-parents-right-withdraw-children-laura-bates-justine-greening-sre-a7607981.html) due to it being “no longer consistent” with English case law and not consistent with the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) and [UN](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx) Human Rights laws.
1.6.10.3. Con: The ability of parents to remove their children from classes that teach subjects and information with which they do not agree with is far from widespread.
1.6.10.3.1. Pro: The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe  have [condemned](http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&lang=en) creationism in education, regarding it as an attack on two fundamental European principals: the separation of church and state and the freedom of education.
1.6.10.3.1.1. Pro: To ensure religious freedom and freedom of education, European countries offer the teaching of religious facts in other subjects \(France\); non-confessional religious education \(England, Sweden\); optional confessional religious education \(Spain, Netherlands\), or, when mandatory, the possibility to opt out \(Romania\) [\(Pépin, p. 20\)](http://www.nef-europe.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Teaching-about-religion_NEF-RelDem-RELIGION-EDUCATION-Final.pdf).
1.6.10.3.2. Pro: In the UK, teachers are forced to teach Darwin's [theory of evolution](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9713524/Free-schools-forced-to-teach-evolution-in-science-classes.html), regardless of whether they believe in it.
1.6.10.3.3. Pro: [Biology](http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbprofall?Rep=HS01) is a requirement to graduate high school in the United States.
1.6.10.3.4. Pro: In the US, the number of public schools which offer [creationism](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/creationism_in_public_schools_mapped_where_tax_money_supports_alternatives.html) as an alternative for biology is small.
1.6.10.4. Pro: The teaching of [creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_United_States#Recent_developments_in_state_education_programs), as opposed to the theory of evolution, has been a contentious issue in the US, subject to a wide number of litigations, including rulings by the Supreme Court. Presently, some states still allow public schools to opt out of teaching evolution.
1.6.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.10.3.4.
1.6.10.4.2. Pro: Eight US states have passed [bills](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-states-texas-creationism-science-teacher-state-law-evolution-religion-a7632931.html) \(or are creating them\) to legally protect teachers who want to teach creationism as a scientific theory.
1.6.10.5. Pro: [Australia](https://theconversation.com/religious-classes-in-schools-must-adapt-to-fit-a-changing-australia-81484) offers religion classes and, depending on the state, children can opt-out or opt-in of them.
1.6.10.5.1. Con: However, many organisations and parents complain that children are not given proper [alternatives](http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/10/22/3615647.htm) and are therefore ‘forced’ to attend religious classes, often imparted by Scripture teachers that promote [indoctrination](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/creationism-creeps-into-nsw-schools/news-story/96cf10dc8b8b65b27953fa1e491c2d1c?nk=c82afeaf02f0d9b19f1bac4996402d0c-1510580078).
