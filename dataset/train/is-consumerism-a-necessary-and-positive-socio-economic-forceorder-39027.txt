Discussion Name: Is consumerism a necessary and positive socio economic force/order.

1. Consumerism is a positive and necessary socio economic force/order.
1.1. Pro: Consumerism drives innovation through fierce competition amongst companies that offer products and services to consumers.
1.1.1. Pro: The presence of affluent consumer markets that are willing to invest to improve their lifestyles [attracts investors](https://www.unwe.bg/uploads/Alternatives/1_Slavova.pdf) and motivates companies to develop new products and services for those markets \(p. 9\).
1.1.1.1. Pro: In recent years, many men worldwide have started seeking beauty products to improve their lifestyle. This is leading to companies creating new products and attractive investment opportunities that will rapidly [increase the value](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/men-are-a-multibillion-dollar-growth-opportunity-for-the-beauty-industry.html) of this market.
1.1.2. Pro: Consumerism gives [power to individuals](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2003/summer/art02.pdf) \(or consumers\), as companies innovate to best serve their customers.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Consumers have the power to make companies more successful and also to "bring them down". Consumers can effectively [boycott](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/boycotts/history-successful-boycotts) a particular company by refusing to buy their products.
1.1.2.2. Con: Consumerism might give individuals power over companies, but it does not empower people at a personal level. In fact, research finds that it [depresses](https://time.com/22257/heres-proof-buying-more-stuff-actually-makes-you-miserable/) them.
1.1.3. Pro: When society has a profound need that has not been met, companies will strive to be the first to meet that need, or to be the best at solving the problem. For example, there is currently a fierce competition to obtain [an effective vaccine for COVID19](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-vaccine-anal/at-war-time-speed-china-leads-covid-19-vaccine-race-idUSKBN2481NO).
1.1.3.1. Con: Not all of the organizations that are competing to produce a vaccine are doing so for financial profit. Some of these are government-funded organizations that are primarily concerned with [public health](https://pti-saludglobal-covid19.corp.csic.es/en/development-of-a-sars-cov-2-vaccine-based-on-non-infective-replicons/).
1.1.4. Con: Consumerism is not the only driver of innovation. [Problem-solving](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2014/06/13/innovation-is-problem-solving-and-a-whole-lot-more/) is a more significant source of innovation. Therefore, consumerism isn't absolutely necessary to drive innovation.
1.1.5. Con: Consumerism drives innovation that is focused on maximizing consumption and profit and not necessarily innovation that serves the greater good.
1.1.5.1. Pro: To maximize consumption, companies make their products and services less durable. This is known as ["Planned obsolescence"](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160612-heres-the-truth-about-the-planned-obsolescence-of-tech).
1.1.5.2. Pro: Innovation primarily focused on driving consumer demand and consumption is a destructive force because it takes limited resources away from innovation that may have lower all demand but is inherently useful, drives utility, and serves a greater good/purpose.[\(Reducing wasteful innovation\).](https://primarycare.imedpub.com/reducing-wasteful-innovation.php?aid=105)
1.2. Con: There is a large opportunity cost associated with the time and energy spent on accumulating the money to consume as well as making and selling the goods and services for consumption.
1.2.1. Pro: Since work consumes a [significant part of people's lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3025152/), it makes it difficult for them to spend time with their family. Spending time with one's family can help people avoid [work-family conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93family_conflict).
1.2.2. Pro: Long working hours are bad for [people's health](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313755).
1.2.2.1. Pro: Working longs hours and devoting a majority of one’s day to work related activities \(roughly more than 60% - 70% of your day discounting sleep\) can lead to burnout. \([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642)\)
1.2.3. Con: Although consumerism has a large opportunity cost ratio on the micro-economic scale, this problem does not scale up on the macro-economic level because consumerism, overall, is good for the national economy.
1.3. Con: Blatant consumerism leans toward over-consumption; an artificial demand leading to over-production and massive waste. Human indulgence, as such, affects our environment negatively as well.
1.4. Con: Diminishing [marginal utility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) pushes consumption growth higher continuously until unsustainable levels are reached.
1.4.1. Pro: To compensate for diminishing marginal utility, people have to [increasingly escalate](https://www.elle.com/fashion/shopping/a41845/shopping-dopamine/) their consumption over time.
1.4.1.1. Con: [Anything can become addictive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15723834) if it is rewarded enough. Yet it does not follow from this that nothing is positive.
1.4.1.2. Con: Addictions [can be managed](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/less-consumerism/), including addiction to consumerism.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Addictions [tend to get worse](https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/alcohol). In line with this, people's appetite for consumption does appear to be increasing and getting worse.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Since the 1970s, [self-storage facilities](http://jedsnet.com/journals/jeds/Vol_2_No_1_March_2014/1.pdf) have sprung up across the US, showing that people are accumulating more stuff than they need or can use. \(p. 13\)
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: A successful new sector is probably good for the economy.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: America's [consumer debt](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/maxed) is rising.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Purchasing products and services on sale with a perceived higher than average value provides the [equivalent to the high from ingesting legal/illegal substances](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20161123-shopping-a-sale-gives-you-the-same-feeling-as-getting-high).
1.4.2. Pro: When people buy more of a product, each successive unit becomes [less valuable](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/what-does-law-diminishing-marginal-utility-explain.asp) for them.
1.4.3. Con: Marginal utility is an abstract concept used to predict consumption of a product. Decreasing marginal utility does not mean that consumerism is negative or unnecessary.
1.5. Pro: Consumerism helps to drive the profitable and sustainable production of goods that are a necessity to survive such as food, clothes, shelter, etc.
1.5.1. Con: Many countries have a low production of basic necessities not because of a lack of consumerism, but because of structural, geographical and societal problems, which an increase in consumerism would not address effectively or at all.
1.5.2. Pro: Thanks to the goods society has obtained from consumerism, many people, especially the more educated, consider that [their lives are better](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/12/05/worldwide-people-divided-on-whether-life-today-is-better-than-in-the-past/) than before.
1.5.2.1. Con: Consumerism has also created a [feeling of emptiness](https://exploringyourmind.com/liquid-modernity-and-consumerism-why-we-buy/) where happiness and satisfaction become impossible to reach.
1.5.3. Pro: Without consumerism, the global economy would fall into [depression](https://www.epi.org/publication/bp243/) which has historically led to social instability, conflict, and even death.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Businesses depend on a constant flow of consumers buying products. When this flow is interrupted, businesses start closing and jobs are lost, which causes people to become [impoverished](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/06/08/the-global-economic-outlook-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-changed-world).
1.5.4. Con: There are alternative measures and processes that could be developed and put in place to ensure the production and distribution of necessary goods without consumerism. Such as non profit private, semi private or public entities that are focused on the efficient production and distribution of these essential goods.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The rise of co-ops have been successful in many industries, from distributing food & supplies to large scale banking and insurance, and are often lauded for being [more sustainable](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/cooperatives-sustainable-business-structures) in the process.
1.5.4.2. Con: These alternatives are the minority, and they are less powerful. The world's most influential and powerful [companies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263264/top-companies-in-the-world-by-market-capitalization/#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20most%20recognizable,of%2088.21%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars.), such as Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft, feed on consumerism.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: The nonprofit sector is on the [rise](https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2018#the-nonprofit-sector-in-brief-2018-public-charites-giving-and-volunteering). In nonprofit organizations, income is not distributed to the group's members. When there is no interest in maximizing profits, consumerism is not necessary.
1.5.4.3. Con: The investments into efficient production and distribution systems are likely to be costly, which might increase costs for either the producer or the consumer.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Efficient distribution systems are likely to be [costly](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071315/what-are-some-ways-make-distribution-channel-more-efficient.asp) as they involve indirect channels and intermediaries, such as distributor managers and operators.
1.5.5. Pro: In developing countries, enough necessities aren't produced to cater to everyone. Therefore, an increase in the production of basic necessities is particularly important in poorer nations. \([p. 3](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/ContemporaryAmericanSociety/Chapter%207%20--%20consumerism%20--%20Norton%20August.pdf)\)
1.5.5.1. Con: Many wealthy countries [outsource production](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/2003-04/offshoring/impact.html) to developing countries to procure cheap labour. The problem is not that enough goods are not produced, but the distribution of these goods.
1.5.5.2. Con: Many people living in poor countries \(pre industrialized third world\) can’t afford necessities such as food, drinking water, shelter, etc. It is this lack of spending power and limited means to generating money that often leads to their inability to obtain necessary goods \(domestically or internationally produced\).
1.5.6. Con: Consumerism incentivizes the unsustainable production of goods.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Consumerism drives the development of goods for the sake of consumption, leading to useless and wasteful things.
1.5.6.2. Pro: On a planet with limited resources, the continued expansion of consumption is unsustainable.
1.5.6.3. Pro: If consumers consume without regard to the consequences of production, unsustainable production will take place wherever profitable.
1.5.7. Con: Consumers [are not always concerned with sustainable production.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022242919825649)
1.5.7.1. Pro: Capitalism could be the reason why humanity might [starve by 2050](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhansen/2016/02/09/unless-it-changes-capitalism-will-starve-humanity-by-2050/?sh=2e8b321d7ccc).
1.6. Pro: Consumerism is a critical driver of status and rank in our modern western socio economic structure/hierarchy.
1.6.1. Con: This isn't inherently positive; status and rank - as a hierarchal structure - by definition must have lower-strata individuals who are considered to have less merit, often by virtue of something as tenuous as birth circumstance.
1.6.1.1. Pro: If a person's status and rank are defined by the material goods they have, people with less money are inevitably going to have lower status and rank. Since many people find it difficult to [barely make ends meet](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/religion/news/2013/02/20/53929/working-full-time-and-still-poor/), they are unable to buy products beyond their needs. As a result, their status will inevitably be low.
1.6.2. Con: Rank should not be derived from material possessions.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Rank should be earned on the basis of one's abilities and not on the basis of what one possesses.
1.6.2.2. Con: Those who can afford expensive material possessions have likely earned their rank and status in successful careers. Therefore, their rank is earned, they just display that rank with material possessions.
1.6.2.2.1. Con: Time and energy spent on obtaining money to purchase material possessions in order to display one’s rank to others is not an optimal use of these very limited resources.
1.6.3. Pro: Rank is required for any hierarchical structure to operate effectively. Thus, without consumerism or something to replace it, our current socio-economic structure could collapse with devastating consequences.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Social rank is a proven [incentive](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272712000436#:~:text=The%20rank%20incentive%20helps%20justify,lost%20by%20making%20rankings%20known.) to motivate people to work hard and innovate. Without it, entrepreneurs and workers would lose one of their main motivations.
1.6.4. Con: Consumerism is not necessary in a decentralized economy that broadens the definition of value and does not rely heavily on materialism. \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_\(economics\))\)
1.6.4.1. Pro: Innovative technological advancements, such as Blockchain, are [creating a trend](https://medium.com/\@nweintraut/the-decentralized-economy-dacaf15c07da) that is thought will gradually decentralize the economy.
1.7. Pro: Consumerism is the primary driver of our capitalist based global economy.
1.7.1. Con: Maybe the global economy being heavily based on unrestrained consumerism-based capitalism is not a good idea and should be modified so that consumerism does not play such an important role in providing quality of life to humans.
1.7.1.1. Pro: There are alternatives within our capitalist system that do not involve consumerism. Shifting towards these models would improve the quality of life.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: [Performance economy](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/opinion/an-alternative-to-consumerism-does-exist-the-performance-economy) is an alternative approach to consumerism, where individuals only pay for the value they get from goods and for the amount of time they use them.
1.7.2. Con: A major [shift](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhall/2020/05/27/consumer-revolution/) in consumer behavior is already occurring due to the effects that the COVID19 pandemic is having on the economy. It is unlikely that consumerism will keep driving the global economy.
1.7.2.1. Con: There have been many disasters previous to the COVID19 pandemic. Consumerism still kept driving the global economy.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Consumerism [persisted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) beyond the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: This new financial crisis will be [far worse](http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/the-impact-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-crisis-on-development-finance-9de00b3b/) than the 2008 global financial crisis. Due to the current global situation, external private finance granted to developing economies could drop by 700 billion dollars in 2020 compared to 2019 levels.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Even though we have known about the Climate Crisis for [30 years](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/07/embark-essay-climate-change-pollution-revkin/), and have started to suffer its [negative consequences](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/), an alternative to consumerism is still not being seriously discussed.
1.7.3. Pro: Consumerism leads to increased economic output which, in turn, creates more [jobs](https://www.historycrunch.com/consumerism-positives.html#/).
1.7.4. Pro: Consumer spending represents [70% of the US economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-24/u-s-consumers-are-the-economy-s-best-hope-against-recession).
1.8. Con: Consumerism directly damages the environment.
1.8.1. Pro: Consumerism leads to an increase in the consumption of goods and services. The production of goods and services involves the "[exploitation of natural resources, waste accumulation, and concentration of pollutants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24125654_Consumerism_and_Environment_Does_Consumption_Behaviour_Affect_Environmental_Quality)". All of the processes are detrimental to the environment.
1.8.2. Pro: Household consumption is responsible for [60-80%](https://norwegianscitechnews.com/2016/02/household-consumption-significant-driver-of-climate-other-environmental-impacts/#:~:text=Their%20analysis%2C%20recently%20published%20in,of%20the%20world's%20water%20use.&text=%E2%80%9CBut%20between%2060%2D80%20per,planet%20come%20from%20household%20consumption.) of the environmental impact on the planet. Since our household consumption is part of our consumerist behavior, it means that consumerism significantly damages the environment.
1.8.2.1. Con: [Most emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) come from industry, electricity and transportation, which can only partly be linked to a consumerist way of life.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: [Industry](https://www.britannica.com/technology/industry) produces goods and services intended for public purchase and consumption. Some of these products and services are necessities \(Ex: food, water, housing, etc\), but there is also a significant amount of household income spent on discretionary goods and services \(ex: electronics, apparel, home furnishings, etc\).[\(Avg household expenditure break down\)](https://howmuch.net/articles/breakdown-average-american-spending)
1.8.3. Pro: Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services at an ever increasing rate. Since we live on a planet with finite resources, the inevitable conclusion of the consumerism ethic is ecological destabilization. [As consumerism spreads, earth suffers.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2004/01/consumerism-earth-suffers/#close)
1.8.4. Con: Green consumerism can help [reduce pollution](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272890145_Green_Consumerism_and_Pollution_Control).
1.8.4.1. Con: This [only makes the problem less bad](https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/), but in the end, consummerism is still bad for our planet and not a viable long term strategy for our survival.
1.8.4.2. Con: It is [inherently difficult](https://erb.umich.edu/2018/02/14/why-green-consumerism-isnt-taking-off/) to pursue green consumerism.
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: The vast majority of our food and consumer products are packaged in [non-recyclable plastics](https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/).
1.8.4.2.2. Pro: Many of the more "sustainable" products are often [more expensive](https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/), limiting the number of people who can actually make use of them.
1.8.4.2.3. Pro: Companies are [reluctant](https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/the-top-ten-reasons-why-businesses-arent-more-sustainable/) to take steps that cost them more money for the sake of sustainability.
1.8.4.2.3.1. Con: Social sustainability movements since the 1990s have pushed large corporations to implement and practice [more sustainable environmental policies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/06/18/the-future-of-corporate-responsibility/#262e94156105).
1.8.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: Since consumer boycotts pushed Nike into joining with the UN to create the [UN Global Compact Initiative](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2018/06/18/the-future-of-corporate-responsibility/#262e94156105), more than 10,000 companies have signed up for the sustainability initiative.
1.8.4.2.3.2. Pro: While [65% of consumers polled](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-sustainability-professionals-should-drive-green-consumerism) said they desired to buy from brands that advocate or practice sustainability, only 26% of them actually do so.
1.8.4.2.4. Con: Many independent projects are [successfully pursuing](https://www.fastcompany.com/3015838/can-sustainable-consumerism-work) green consumerism.
1.8.4.2.4.1. Pro: Independent programs, such as the [Rainforest Alliance Certified](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/certification/) agriculture, has helped [raise yields on existing cropland](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/articles/the-rainforest-alliances-work-in-peru) to sustainably meet rising global food demand.
1.8.4.3. Pro: Since a radical change in consumerism seems [unlikely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhall/2020/05/27/consumer-revolution/), [Green consumerism](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/green-consumerism-importance-examples-strategies.php), which is already being accepted and practiced by many consumers, will probably have the most positive environmental impact.
1.8.5. Pro: Consumers are often [most concerned with getting the highest quality product for the cheapest price](https://business.time.com/2011/05/02/high-quality-low-price-the-consumer-quest-for-cheap-premium-brands/), even if this is detrimental to the environment.
1.8.5.1. Pro: [Even when aware of the negative consequences](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/penneys-shows-paradox-of-consumers-who-talk-about-ethics-but-buy-based-on-price-1.3924861) of their consumer behaviour, individuals will still base their purchasing choices on price.
1.9. Con: Superficial materialistic attitudes to life distract us from cultivating deeper, longer-lasting [meaning and purpose](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/viewing-consumer-culture_b_105750).
1.9.1. Pro: People with materialistic attitudes are, on average, less happy. [Psychology research](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/discontents) has found that the least materialistic people are happier in comparison, regardless of socioeconomic status.
1.9.2. Con: Living in a consumerist society does not mean people will stop pursuing meaning and purpose.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Some people living in consumer cultures cultivate deep values and meaning through [religion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580713/).
1.9.2.2. Pro: [25% of the adult population](https://nonprofitssource.com/online-giving-statistics/volunteering-statistics/#:~:text=Approximately%2063%20million%20Americans%20%E2%80%94%2025,their%20time%20to%20our%20communities.) in the US has volunteered their time to help others. Even though they live in a consumerist society, they volunteer to cultivate selfless, unmaterialistic values.
1.9.2.3. Con: Pursuing meaning and purpose becomes much more difficult when a person is constantly occupied with maintaining their superficial lifestyle.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: In consumerist societies, people are being constantly distracted and persuaded by [advertising](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8846775/Frantz%2C_Gregory.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). Thus, a contemplative lifestyle that pursues meaning and purpose is incompatible.
1.9.3. Pro: Our [creativity](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151117130342.htm) is dampened by an overabundance of consumer products.
1.9.3.1. Con: The variety of products and services in our consumerist society precisely allows people to improve their [creativity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/creativity).
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Online courses available today can teach anybody with an internet connection to take on any [artistic](https://www.udemy.com/topic/painting/free/) or [creative](https://www.edx.org/learn/writing) activity. These consumer products improve creativity.
1.9.3.1.2. Pro: Consumerism also encourages people to travel, which [boosts](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/for-a-more-creative-brain-travel/388135/) creativity.
1.9.3.2. Pro: An overabundance of products leaves less room for new innovations to be developed, as businesses do not want to risk their investment in [saturated markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsaturation.asp).
1.9.3.2.1. Con: This tendency is in itself forcing companies to get creative in the products they invent. In some cases, resulting in extremely [creative](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/money/g28649116/weirdest-products-on-amazon/) products.
1.9.3.3. Pro: Consumerism has led the [music industry](https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/your-voice/opinion/article/3060080/consumerism-has-killed-music-industrys-creativity) to become unimaginative and repetitive.
