Discussion Name: Should the U.S. increase the quota of H-1B visas?

1. Should the U.S. increase the quota of H-1B visas?
1.1. Con: Taking in too many migrants at once expands the risk of erosion of the culture of the host nation.
1.1.1. Con: Culture is a social construct and there is no tangible harm if the American culture is eroded.
1.1.2. Con: America prides itself in being [melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot). Taking in immigrants does not erode the American culture but adds diversity to it.
1.1.3. Pro: [Immigrants](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-study-idUSKCN0RS08V20150928) and their descendants are projected to account for the 88% of the population growth by 2065 in the US.
1.1.4. Pro: According to recent projections, by 2042 the US could reach majority-minority status, meaning that [less than half](https://www.prb.org/uspopulationgrowth/) the population will be non-Hispanic white.
1.2. Pro: Illegal innimgration may be [reduced](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2015/10/05/more-work-visas-less-illegal-immigration/#655b5be411fa).
1.2.1. Con: Many illegal immigrants are unskilled. Congress has [prohibited](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2015/10/05/more-work-visas-less-illegal-immigration/#2c9d3c7811fa) legal employment for foreign nationals in the types of jobs that are typically filled by unauthorized immigrants. Therefore, increasing the quota will not cater to these immigrants.
1.2.2. Pro: Many immigrants illegally entering the United States have [college degrees](https://qz.com/1627664/undocumented-immigrants-in-the-us-are-increasingly-better-educated/). Therefore, they are likely to find employment.
1.2.3. Con: There is no evidence that illegal immigration would stop.
1.2.4. Con: A decrease in immigration might not be beneficial to the country.
1.3. Con: Increased amounts in population can put more pressure on public services.
1.3.1. Pro: Sectors like public education have already endured and are likely to endure serious [budget cuts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trumps-first-full-education-budget-deep-cuts-to-public-school-programs-in-pursuit-of-school-choice/2017/05/17/2a25a2cc-3a41-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html?utm_term=.c2e0dc219874).
1.4. Pro: U.S. will receive more tax revenue.
1.4.1. Pro: Raising the H-1B cap would also increase [tax revenues](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy) significantly. H-1B visa holders earn high wages--the average H-1B worker earned $71,000 in 2007--and pay substantial taxes on those earnings.
1.4.2. Pro: The H-1B system is designed to directly keep those employed under it from staying in the US past their allotted Visa time.
1.4.3. Con: That increase of revenue may be offset by social benefits used by immigrants on H-1B visas or their families.
1.4.3.1. Con: H-1B visa holders have to pay [taxes](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/aliens-employed-in-the-us-social-security-taxes) for Social Security and Medicare.
1.5. Pro: America will have a better [economy](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy).
1.5.1. Con: The fact that employers can have workers willing to work for relatively low wages may harm productivity, training and innovation.
1.5.2. Pro: People will obtain more American jobs. [\(Source\)](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy)
1.5.3. Con: Many of the H-1B visas are given out to job shops, which essentially allow American companies to outsource work
and consequently reduce the industrial base in America. [\(Source\)](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf)
1.5.4. Pro: H1-B visas and immigrants are an important source of innovation and economic benefit we have seen in the United States. [\(Source\)](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/crackdown-on-foreign-work-visas-would-devastate-us-economy-commentary.html)
1.5.4.1. Pro: Immigrants are twice as likely as U.S. born citizens to start a business and small business accounts for a whopping 99.7 percent of U.S. businesses. [\(Source\)](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/crackdown-on-foreign-work-visas-would-devastate-us-economy-commentary.html)
1.5.5. Pro: America's economic competitiveness is currently going down.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Skilled immigrant workers can help to boost economic competitiveness by bolstering our gross human capital.
1.5.6. Pro: If caps were raised to 195,000 visas would increase revenues by a total of nearly $69 billion over eight years. As opposed to tax increases, this would be an economically beneficial source of revenue. [\(Source\)](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy)
1.6. Con: The H-1B visa system is primarily to the detriment of American citizens.
1.6.1. Con: The life of an American citizen is not more valuable than the life of a citizen in another country.
1.6.1.1. Pro: American citizens were born is USA because of the accident of birth. They did not put in any effort of their own to be accorded the privileges of being a US citizen.
1.6.2. Pro: Businesses hire H-1B visa holders not because they are
especially skilled or that there is a lack of US workers, but instead because H-1B visa holders are willing to work for [lower wages](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf) than their American counterparts.
1.6.3. Pro: Increasing the supply of skilled workers could reduce Americans' [wages](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy).
1.6.3.1. Pro: When companies cannot hire as many highly skilled workers as they need, competition drives wages up, so raising the visa cap may indeed cause the wages of some Americans to fall or stagnate. [\(Source\)](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy)
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: By adding the supply of skilled workers could lower their salary. Since every H-1B worker creates four new jobs,the request for such somewhat un-quailefied  but necessary workers would reduce their wages.This,meaning if a company provides $25 an hour to their workers  and has 50 workers,but then gets 15 new workers,the company will have to decrease the amount of what all the workers get paid.The output will be that workers quit because of the low expense pay.
1.6.3.2. Con: Since each H-1B worker creates four new American jobs, the demand for such somewhat less-skilled but necessary workers would raise their wages. [\(Source\)](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy)
1.7. Con: The H-1B visa system is often abused and that its provisions are unenforced.
1.7.1. Pro: There are numerous instances of businesses and individuals [exploiting](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf) or taking advantage of the H-1B visa system in illegal ways.
1.7.1.1. Pro: By the terms of the legislation, for instance, H-1B visa holders are required to be paid the prevailing wage in an industry and it is also recommended by the Department of Labor
that businesses seek American workers first. [\(Source\)](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf)
1.7.2. Pro: Expanding the quota would only make it more [difficult](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf) to enforce these rules and consequently lead to more abuse, making the overall system less efficient.
1.8. Con: Political backlash will be incited.
1.8.1. Pro: It will increase support for the far-right and give rise to populist leaders.
1.8.2. Pro: Expanding the quota system would result in the destruction of [political momentum](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf) toward current reforms in the immigration system, or it would result in the institution of other retaliatory policies that would ultimately hurt the immigration outlook.
1.8.3. Con: Many measures a government may take can lead to backlash, but if a government sees them as necessary, they should be implemented.
1.9. Con: Expanding the quota for H-1B visa workers would unfairly disadvantage other members seeking to immigrate to the United States.
1.9.1. Pro: Allowing in more H-1B visa holders would essentially ‘[crowd out](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf)’ other immigrants whose lives could be improved more by coming to the United States.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Because H-1B visa holders are required to have some specialized skills, they are usually among the more well-off citizens of their home country. [\(Source\)](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/April2018PFTA.pdf)
1.9.1.2. Pro: Immigrants seeking asylum or refuge from humanitarian disasters could end up getting displaced in favor of educated, wealthier immigrants.
1.10. Con: US Federal Law mandates that employers put US citizens first.
1.11. Pro: The US may have a beneficial increase in population.
1.11.1. Con: Higher immigration levels were beneficial at a time in America when cities were not overpopulated. However, currently, USA is already overpopulated.
1.11.1.1. Pro: According to a June 2018 Rasmussen poll, [51%](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_sep04) of Americans believe population growth is outpacing capacity.
1.11.1.2. Pro: According to the Pew Research Center, of the nearly 45 million foreign-born who live in the U.S., most immigrants reside in just [twenty](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/17/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) major metropolitan areas.
1.11.2. Pro: Research claims that the "US fertility rate is below level needed to [replace population](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/10/health/us-fertility-rate-replacement-cdc-study/index.html)", therefore an increase of population is beneficial.
1.12. Pro: There will no longer be a [shortage](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy) of skilled workers.
1.12.1. Pro: The US still has a [shortage of nurses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493175/) despite having associate degree nursing programs for citizens. Increasing the available working visas to migrants is a possible solution because this shortage will negatively affect US health care.
1.12.2. Pro: There are simply [not enough](https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/more-h-1b-visas-more-american-jobs-better-economy) Americans with the advanced mathematical, computer, and engineering skills that employers in these fields need.
1.12.2.1. Con: Considering the amount of US [population](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/), if the country is not producing enough high-skilled workers, education reforms \(including better funding\) may be a more needed and better solution than visas.
1.12.3. Con: This becomes a poor way of dealing with the problem of generating a sufficient amount of available workers for speciality fields, which cause larger problems in the long-term.
1.12.3.1. Pro: This can cause people to feel like the issue has been solved, leading to them putting less effort in creating more sustainable, long-term solutions that attract sufficient amount of workers to these speciality fields.
1.13. Con: Migrants may not be paid according to wage standards.
1.13.1. Con: If they have a H-1B and are under a proper contract, that is unlikely.
1.13.1.1. Pro: If H-1B visa workers are paid wages lower than the minimum wage, they can take their employers to court.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: It will be difficult for these migrant workers to win a case against their firm.
1.13.1.1.1.1. Pro: Workers will have to file a civil claim against their employer. Civil law suits are [expensive](https://gamalawfirm.com/blog/why-are-lawsuits-so-expensive/) since the claimant has to cover the legal costs.
1.13.1.1.1.2. Pro: Companies can hire skilled and experienced lawyers because they have the money to do so as compared to a migrant worker who had to work below minimum wage.
1.13.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Lawyers can use [delaying tactics](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3947466241/delaying-tactics-used-by-lawyers-in-dispensation-of) to lengthen the court proceedings. This dries up the other party of funds and they are forced to either drop the claim or settle.
1.13.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Courts are being more [proactive](https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/wig-chamber/17821-judges-using-powers-to-shut-down-delaying-tactics-in-litigation) in pushing for a quick and cheap resolution of litigation.
1.13.2. Con: Illegal immigrant are even more likely to be paid below minimum wages.
