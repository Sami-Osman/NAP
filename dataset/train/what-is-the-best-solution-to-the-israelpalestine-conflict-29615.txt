Discussion Name: What is the best "solution" to the Israel/Palestine conflict?

1. The best "solution" to the [Israel/Palestine conflict](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/israeli-palestinian-conflict) is...
1.1. [A two-state solution](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-two-state-solution.html).
1.1.1. Pro: Let each group decide what their course of action to take themselves, based on their positions within the region \(politically, culturally, historically, etc.; so each of them will have a certain % say, based on their standing in these categories\).
1.1.1.1. Con: Israel has [more political allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Israel) within the Middle-Eastern region, meaning that the decision would not be equitable and fair towards both parties, rather it would be tilted towards Israel.
1.1.1.2. Con: The valuing of political, cultural and historical position in the region seems to be difficult to make and dubious for such an important matter as peace, national aspirations and welfare of two large populations.
1.1.1.3. Con: Israel would never accept such an option if it means that the Arab League will vote on a return to the [1967 boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict#After_2000) which is not aligned with [Israel's government policy](https://jcpa.org/requirements-for-defensible-borders/us_israels_struggle_against_1967_lines/).
1.1.1.4. Con: Countries in the region have an enormous bias against Israel. The decision would not be equitable and fair towards both parties, rather it would be tilted in favor of Palestine.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League#Membership) in the region endorse a [boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League_boycott_of_Israel) of Israel. Any decision they would take would be heavily biased against Israel.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [17 of the 22 Arab League members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League_boycott_of_Israel#Diplomatic_non-recognition): Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, do not recognize the state of Israel.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Most Arab countries in the region have been in one or [many wars](https://www.britannica.com/event/Arab-Israeli-wars) against Israel. Any decision they would take would be heavily biased against Israel.
1.1.2. Con: A Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank would be much smaller than Israel and separated by Israel in the middle.
1.1.3. Con: Israeli backed [settlement building](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2019-10-15/there-will-be-one-state-solution) in the West Bank has reduced the space available for a sovereign Palestinian state.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Israeli settlements would have to be evacuated in order to create a viable Palestinian state.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Considering [legal precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza#Compensation_and_resettlement), a disengagement of the West Bank would be too costly in terms of [monetary compensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_statistics_for_Israeli_settlements_in_the_West_Bank).
1.1.3.1.2. Con: Disengagement of [Sinai](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/35008/341386.pdf;jsessionid=851869029BFC993798A2A6C646115668?sequence=1) and [Gaza](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/fact-sheet-gaza-disengagement-facts-history-political-relaty) went considerably smoother than expected. \(p. 40\)
1.1.3.1.3. Con: Israel has the ability to offer incentives for people within the settlements to evacuate and relocate voluntarily.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The majority of settlers are motivated by economic or quality-of-life concerns, since Israel subsidizes housing and amenities in the settlements, and could likely be convinced to relocate [voluntarily with economic incentives](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/how-to-evacuate-100-000-israelis-from-the-west-bank/255775/).
1.1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: According to a [report by the Oxford Research Group](http://www.bluewhitefuture.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Settler_Report.pdf), there are a significant number of secular settlers in the Jordan Valley who are eager for economic compensation to move back within Israel's pre-1967 borders.
1.1.4. Pro: Israel could stay a Jewish state, the reason it was founded.
1.1.4.1. Con: Israel remaining a Jewish state does not address the concerns of Palestinian citizens of Israel who wish Israel to become a "[state for all it's citizens](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-knesset-council-bans-bill-to-define-israel-as-state-for-all-citizens-1.6145333)" regardless of its border.
1.1.5. Pro: A Two-State Solution could facilitate greater cooperation between the two groups at an intergovernmental level.
1.1.5.1. Pro: A [Shared Tourism Revenue](https://www.hoover.org/research/creating-incentives-israeli-palestinian-peace) arrangement could be negotiated between the two states to link them closer.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Sharing revenue through an international agreement doesn't require military or land concessions.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Linking the tourism revenue of the two-states would encourage peace and coordination.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: [Tourism is extremely sensitive to violence](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/614/1/JournalofConflictResolution_48\(2\).pdf), therefore an arrangement where both parties profit from tourism incentivizes both sides to minimize violence.
1.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: A shared-revenue arrangement will encourage both sides to [improve access to important religious, historic, and cultural sites](https://www.hoover.org/research/creating-incentives-israeli-palestinian-peace), assuring access for everyone to the contested sites of Jerusalem and other parts of Israel and Palestine.
1.1.5.2. Con: This leaves several aspects of the conflict unresolved.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: This proposal addresses the most important issue: [minimizing violence](https://www.hoover.org/research/creating-incentives-israeli-palestinian-peace).
1.1.5.3. Pro: Both states could be organized into a federation or confederation.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Federation does not work for small territories like Israel/Palestine.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Palestinians would have access to the stronger Israeli economy
1.1.5.3.3. Pro: Freedom of movement could be guaranteed, meaning Israeli settler could remain in the West Bank, and Palestinians pursue opportunities in Israel.
1.1.5.3.4. Pro: A federation may [improve](http://www.federation.org.il/index.php/en/the-federation-plan) the security of Israel.
1.1.5.3.5. Pro: There are [27 federal states](http://www.federation.org.il/index.php/en/the-federation-plan) worldwide, and many of their conflicts were resolved with the implementation of a federal system.
1.1.5.3.6. Pro: A [confederation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/29/an-israeli-palestinian-confederation-can-work/) would provide unique benefits.
1.1.5.3.6.1. Pro: Neither Jews or Palestinians have to give up their claim to national self-determination
1.1.5.3.6.2. Pro: Jerusalem could remain a unified and shared city
1.1.5.3.6.3. Con: The issue of borders and refugees would still have to be negotiated
1.1.5.3.6.4. Con: Many Palestinians would still resent the presence of Israeli's on their land.
1.1.5.3.6.4.1. Con: Many Israelis would still resent the presence of Palestinians on their land.
1.1.5.3.6.5. Con: An open market between the two drastically different economies could foster Palestinian dependence on Israel
1.1.5.3.6.6. Con: Both Israelis and Palestinians would still have to give up their claim to all of the land in Palestine.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Having two formal, recognized governments would allow for the establishment of embassies and diplomatic relations.
1.1.5.5. Con: The establishment of two states could also lead to a formal war, if diplomacy and cooperation are not successful.
1.1.5.5.1. Pro: The widespread recognition of the state of Palestine would likely lead to the militarization of the [Palestinian security forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Security_Services), or the [integration of Hamas](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/palestinian-national-unity-formalizing-informal)(PA Ministers and Security officials-such as Minister of International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath and PA Preventative Security Head Muhammed Dahlan-confirmed ongoing discussions and the Arafat invitation to Hamas. And only last week, Marwan Barghouthi publicly called for the formation of a unity government with the Islamists.) into the state.
1.1.5.5.2. Con: A formal war would be clearly subject to international law, with which the current conflict has a [tumultuous relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict)(The main points of dispute \(also known as the "core issues" or "final status issues"\) are the following:\n\n Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem \(Israel has also annexed the Golan Heights, but that territory isn't claimed by Palestinians\), construction of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories and the erection of the Israeli West Bank barrier;\n how borders should be decided between Israel and a Palestinian state;\n the right of return of the Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars.).
1.1.6. Con: The Two State solution ignores the fact that thanks to Israeli policy, there are in effect three states: Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Plus, [Gaza is run by Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance_of_the_Gaza_Strip)(The Hamas government of 2016 exercises de facto rule over the Gaza Strip, supported by the Palestinian Legislative Council, which is dominated by members of Hamas.), the [West Bank by Fatah and Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories)(Presently, most of the West Bank is administered by Israel though 42% of it is under varying degrees of autonomous rule by the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority.)
1.1.6.1. Con: A two-state solution would mean an end to the Israeli policy that created the three-state situation, and the Gaza state would likely be absorbed into the greater Palestine including the West Bank.
1.1.7. Con: There are many unresolved issues that would make a two-state solution difficult to achieve.
1.1.7.1. Pro: It does not address the question of [right of return for Palestinian refugees](https://ifamericansknew.org/history/ref-qumsiyeh.html).
1.1.7.1.1. Con: Palestinian refugees could return to the new state of Palestine.
1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: This doesn't adress the claims of Palestinian who left '67 Israel.
1.1.7.2. Con: Both Israelis and Palestinians could form second countries elsewhere, so that they have a peaceful, backup means to survive, so there's less of a conflict in Israel \(and more peaceful living options\) with a means to expand outside of the area.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Forming separate, independent Jewish and Palestinian states outside of Israel would happen through acquiring land via methods [used in the past](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/history-of-israel), as well as new methods, and having it recognized by major countries and organizations, like the UN and US.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Either nation could buy land from the existing nations, similar to what was done in The [Louisiana Purchase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase), which included the acquisition of the territory of Louisiana by the United States from France in 1803.
1.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: The creation of new land for the need of human activities has been consistently done over the years through [land reclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reclamation), especially through utilizing the Mediterranean Sea. This could be a means of forming separate, independent territories for both nations.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: The formation of second countries or colonies elsewhere would cause more conflict, as land would have to be taken from another nation.
1.1.7.2.2.1. Pro: The only unclaimed land on Earth is in [Antarctica](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426082-700-the-last-place-on-earth-to-be-unclaimed-by-any-nation/)(1.6 million square kilometres of West Antarctica known as Marie Byrd Land, roughly one-tenth of the whole continent, had not been claimed by any country. It remains the only unclaimed land on Earth.), which is generally uninhabitable. All other land is claimed by a nation, and would have to be taken or purchased by Israel or Palestine.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Jerusalem would have to either be divided or shared. Given that [neither population is willing to give up Jerusalem](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080094/what-are-the-two-state-solution-and-the-one-state-solution), it makes the two-state solution next to impossible.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Jerusalem could be recognized as Israel's capital and West Bank should be given to Palestinians. This compromise could lead to a breakthrough.
1.1.7.3.1.1. Pro: This would lead to more Middle eastern states easing tensions with Israel.
1.1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Palestinians deserve the West Bank as an independent nation.
1.1.7.3.1.2.1. Pro: Palestinians deserve more than the West Bank. Many former Palestinian villages that were massacred by Zionist militants still exist as Israeli towns with Hebrew colonial names. Israel must return this land.
1.1.7.3.1.3. Con: Jerusalem was the home of the Palestinians before Zionist miltiias came and stole it. Tel Aviv can be recognized as the capital of Israel while Yafa and other land inside Israel that was taken by Zionist terrorists could be return to Palestinians as is their right.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: Jerusalem could be put under a special bi-national municipal authority, and Israel's capital institution allowed to remain in West Jerusalem while Palestine could establish their in East Jerusalem.
1.1.7.3.2.1. Con: The borders of each state would effectively be drawn at the Jerusalem city line. Both states would have to agree to a common policy on who has a right to reside and travel in and out of Jerusalem.
1.1.7.3.2.2. Con: Both states would have to agree to a common security policy in Jerusalem.
1.1.7.3.2.2.1. Con: Security in Jerusalem could be put under international control.
1.1.7.3.3. Con: Jerusalem can be made into an international city as [Vatican City proposed to the UN with Resolution 181.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_separatum_\(Jerusalem\))
1.1.7.3.4. Con: It is the choice of the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian public to refuse to accept a deal, and prefer war over having self-determination. They have the freedom to choose war and the consequences.
1.1.8. Pro: Both Jews and Arab Palestinians have the right to self-determination in the lands they are indigenous to. A Two-State solution is a compromise that ensures both communities have this right separate from each other.
1.1.8.1. Pro: According to the Bible and historical records, the region is [ancient homeland of the Jewish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism)(“Israel” first appears near the end of the 13th century BC within the Egyptian Merneptah Stele, referring apparently to a people \(rather than a place\) inhabiting what was then “Canaan.” A few centuries later in that region, we find two sister kingdoms: Israel and Judah \(the origin of the term “Jew”\). According to the Bible, there had first been a monarchy comprising both, apparently also called “Israel.”\n\n...the territory of the former kingdom of Judah served as the heart of Judaism for almost seven centuries \(although the rebuilt Temple was again destroyed in AD 70, by the Romans\).), and assert a right to self-determination there.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Prior to British control, the region was under Islamic Arab control for over [1,200 years](https://theconversation.com/the-history-of-israel-and-palestine-alternative-names-competing-claims-163156)(Palestine’\n\nIn AD 135, following a failed Jewish revolt, Roman Emperor Hadrian expelled the Jews from Jerusalem and decreed that the city and surrounding territory be part of a larger entity called “Syria-Palestina.” “Palestina” took its name from the coastal territory of the ancient Philistines, enemies of the Israelites \(ancestors of the Jews\).\n\nSubsequent to the Islamic conquest of the Middle East in the seventh century, Arab peoples began to settle in the former “Palestina.” Apart from about 90 years of Crusader domination, the land fell under Muslim control for just under 1,200 years. Although Jewish habitation never ceased, the population was overwhelmingly Arab.). Palestinian people use this heritage to assert nationhood and self-determination.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: Palestinian people assert their heritage from [Canaanite](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/dna-from-biblical-canaanites-lives-modern-arabs-jews)(The researchers also compared the ancient DNA with that of modern populations and found that most Arab and Jewish groups in the region owe more than half of their DNA to Canaanites and other peoples who inhabited the ancient Near East—an area encompassing much of the modern Levant, Caucasus, and Iran.) ancestors who were indigenous to the land as well.
1.1.8.3. Con: Both peoples make a [claim to land in Jerusalem](https://www.france24.com/en/20171206-explainer-status-jerusalem-capital-israel-palestinians-trump)(The city is revered by three major faiths but mired in political and religious disputes. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state.), and claim it as the capital of their respective states.
1.1.9. Con: Public opinion in Israel has [faced a decline](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/29/an-israeli-palestinian-confederation-can-work/) in support of the two-state solution, showing that the Israeli citizens are against this solution being implemented.
1.1.10. Pro: This is the original plan agreed to by the [U.N. in 1947](https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/nov-29-1947-united-nations-partitions-palestine-allowing-for-creation-of-israel/) and the one that the international community supports.
1.1.10.1. Pro: Israel's largest ally, the United States, [supports](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-final-meeting-obama-tells-netanyahu-two-state-solution-needs-to-be-kept-alive/) a two-state solution.
1.1.10.1.1. Con: [Announcements](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/articles/104/153/198/1574225326851.html) made by the US that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate the international law undermines the two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Pro: In 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [announced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/pompeo-israeli-settlements-inconsistent-int-law-191118192156311.html) that the US government will no longer consider Israel's West Bank settlements "inconsistent" with the international law.
1.2. A no-state solution.
1.2.1. Pro: Neither party in the conflict has a strongly enough justified claim to rule over the area. To remove the issue of nationhood would be to undo an old injustice which is a large contributor to the conflict.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Identitarianism is at the root of this conflict, just as it is in many other areas around the world. Having strict punishments for those who try to assert ethnic or religious claims to this areas would stop much of the conflict.
1.2.1.2. Con: If nationhood is enough to cause two parties to engage in [consistent and deadly conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict)(The history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict began with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.\n\nThis conflict came from the intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine between Israelis and Arabs from 1920 and erupted into full-scale hostilities in the 1947–48 civil war. The conflict continues to the present day on various levels.), then it is likely that attempting to remove these peoples of their nationhood would also cause significant conflict.
1.2.2. Pro: Through removing the perpetrators of the conflict one also removes part of the reason for its continued existence.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Removing the nation-state from the equation of the conflict refocuses the conflict towards the reason for the conflict in the first place.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: The creation of the Israeli nation-state is the reason for the conflict, as war first broke out in this context after the [Israeli declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#1948%E2%80%9349_war:_Israel_and_the_Arab_states)(The termination of the British mandate over Palestine and the Israeli Declaration of Independence sparked a full-scale war \(1948 Arab–Israeli War\) which erupted after May 14, 1948.).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Removing the issue of nationhood may only refocus the issue into a religious or ethnic war, which could allow it to spread further.
1.2.2.2. Con: Removing the State does not necessarily remove the individual perpetrators who are complicit with the state or the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Even if these perpetrators or non-state actors are not removed, it is likely that they have less power.
1.2.2.3. Con: Removing the state might lead to a proliferation of violent actors who might actually increase violence.
1.2.3. Con: Both nations are likely to dislike this solution.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Both nations would have to give up their claim to national self-determination.
1.2.3.2. Con: No nation that commits atrocities against other humans of the likes committed in this conflict has a right to exist.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Very few states would meet this test of legitimacy. Countries with a history of colonialism, such as the UK, have committed [mass atrocities](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/worst-atrocities-british-empire-amritsar-boer-war-concentration-camp-mau-mau-a6821756.html) against a greater amount of people.
1.2.3.3. Con: There are numerous binational or multinational states whose peoples have live in relative harmony including [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia)(The federal constitutional monarchy consists of thirteen states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two regions, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo's East Malaysia.), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland)(Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. The country is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern.) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation)(The German Confederation \(German: Deutscher Bund\) was an association of 39 predominantly German-speaking sovereign states in Central Europe. It was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as a replacement of the former Holy Roman Empire, which had been dissolved in 1806.).
1.2.3.4. Pro: Jerusalem is a sacred site in [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_significance_of_Jerusalem) and the holiest city in [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_significance_of_Jerusalem). Therefore, both nations would likely be unhappy losing access and ownership to their religious sites.
1.2.3.5. Pro: The [Israeli](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/israel-globalism-and-nationalism-479586)(Israel is rooted in the ideology of Zionism, the movement for Jewish sovereign national self-determination. Zionism is a nationalist movement, pure and simple.) and [Palestinian](https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/06/28/revitalizing-palestinian-nationalism-options-versus-realities-pub-71364)(Palestinian political and cultural identity and the perceived ideal of Palestinian unity still seem to resonate strongly...) peoples are both incredibly nationalistic and patriotic.
1.2.4. Pro: Removing the states would not eliminate the national identities, and would not necessarily change public attitudes.
1.2.4.1. Con: When states are removed, people are likely to form new national identities.
1.2.5. Con: The participants will still have to agree to an alternative method for decision making and community life in the territory.
1.2.6. Con: Having a state is necessary in such an unstable area in order to maintain stability.
1.3. A single [bi-national](https://www.salon.com/2018/06/05/a-just-one-state-solution-is-still-possible-in-israelpalestine-but-not-if-the-media-buries-it/) hybrid state.
1.3.1. Pro: Jerusalem could remain a unified city and serve as capital of the new state.
1.3.2. Con: Issue of right of return for birth Diaspora Jews and Palestinains refugees would still have to be negotiated
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3.4. Con: Creating two distinct nations within a hybrid state perpetuates the existing Israeli-Palestinian divide.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Economic inequality between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs could create as system of economic segregation and exploitation.
1.3.4.2. Con: The creation of a hybrid state would create a new, single national identity, which could help to heal the Israeli-Palestinian divide.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Both peoples have claim to the land of [historic Palestine](https://www.salon.com/2018/06/05/a-just-one-state-solution-is-still-possible-in-israelpalestine-but-not-if-the-media-buries-it/)(The one-state solution is the idea of bringing justice and peace to Palestine/Israel by having all inhabitants of historic Palestine — the land that includes Israel, the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza ...), so a compromise could be reached by creating a modern, mixed national identity within the region.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: After years of bloodshed and conflict, it is unlikely that both communities would come together under a single, new national identity.
1.3.5. Pro: A hybrid state would be able to take advantage of the geopolitical allies of both Palestine and Israel in order to create a new status-quo.
1.3.6. Con: Palestinian political leadership, across diverse parties, openly deny the holocaust and calls for the extermination of Jews.
1.3.6.1. Pro: For example, numerous articles in Hamas’ charter call for the genocide of Jews. Hamas is supported by a near majority of the Palestinians electorate. [https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp)
1.4. Israel annexes the West Bank and gives Palestinians the option of citizenship.
1.4.1. Pro: Gaza could be given to Egypt and Israel could annex part of area C of the West Bank, granting independence to the rest of the West Bank and giving citizenship to all inhabitants of the territories it annexes.
1.4.1.1. Con: This would lead to a non-contiguous Palestinian territory in the West Bank of 227 [heavily residential areas](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/10/07/palestinians-access-area-c-economic-recovery-sustainable-growth).
1.4.1.2. Pro: This could be done immediately without waiting to negotiate with anyone.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Annexation of the West Bank would likely face military opposition from Hamas and its allies, which would delay the solution.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Palestinians could gain full civil rights.
1.4.1.4. Con: Annexing the West Bank will be injurious to Israel’s national security, because it could lead to [a new era of isolation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/17/annexing-the-west-bank-will-destabilize-jordan/) for the Jewish state unseen since its founding in 1948.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: The Arab world is changing, fast. Israeli has i[mproved relationships](https://mepc.org/commentary/israel-emboldened-talk-deepening-relations-arab-neighbors) with its neighbors. Any annexation would be done with careful consultation with these neighbors.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Many nations and people are already critical of Israel and their actions in Palestine.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Ireland has condemned Israels "[de-facto annexation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/26/ireland-recognises-israels-de-facto-annexation-of-palestine)(Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday that the motion “is a clear signal of the depth of feeling across Ireland”.\n\n“The scale, pace and strategic nature of Israel’s actions on settlement expansion and the intent behind it have brought us to a point where we need to be honest about what is actually happening on the ground. … It is de facto annexation,” Coveney, of the centre-right Fine Gael party, told parliament.)" of Palestinian land.
1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Most people worldwide have a "[mainly negative](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5948255/israel-world-opinion)(In almost every country surveyed, over all three years, more people said they had a "mainly negative" than "mainly positive" view of Israel. This was true in every surveyed country in Asia, Europe, and South America.)" perception of Israel.
1.4.1.4.2.3. Pro: Israel was condemned [three times](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/24/un-condemns-israel-most-in-2020-almost-three-times-rest-of-world)(The United Nations General Assembly \(UNGA\) condemned Israel the most during 2020, according to a report by the UN Watch, a Geneva-based non-governmental organisation that monitors the performance of the global body.\n\nWith two of its resolutions criticising Israel last week, the UNGA brought its total number of resolutions against the country to 17 – almost three times compared with the rest of the world, standing at six.) more than any other nation in the UN in 2020.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: The annexation of the West Bank could lead to legal and economic repercussions against the state of Israel.
1.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: Such an aggressive move would be a betrayal of the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords), and would likely result in International condemnation.
1.4.1.4.3.2. Pro: By expanding the borders of Israel, the annexation of the West Bank would be a violation of [U.N resolution 242](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations-Resolution-242)(The Israelis supported the resolution because it called on the Arab states to accept Israel’s right “to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.” Each of the Arab states eventually accepted it \(Egypt and Jordan accepted the resolution from the outset\) because of its clause calling for Israel to withdraw from “territories occupied in the recent conflict.”).
1.4.2. Con: This might cause a [demographic shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition) in the population of Israel, which could cause tensions like was seen in Lebanon before the [Lebanese civil war](https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War) broke out.
1.4.3. Con: It is doubtful that the [discriminatory land and housing practice would stop in area C of the West Bank.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/12/19/israel/west-bank-separate-and-unequal)
1.4.4. Con: Many Palestinians wouldn't want to pledge allegiance to a Jewish state, which is one of the [reasons for the current conflict](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23039624)(...the Palestinians' refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.).
1.4.4.1. Pro: Millions of Palestinians will have little or no hope of ever achieving self determination.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Palestinians would have to give up all national rights including the right of return for refugees.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Palestinians in East Jerusalem offered a similar option after it was annexed, and nearly all rejected citizenship.
1.4.4.3. Pro: It is unlikely that many Jewish people in Israel would want to pledge allegiance to an Islamic state either.
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.6. Con: The West Bank should be given back to Jordan and Gaza back to Egypt, not be conquered by Israel.
1.4.6.1. Con: Giving away land will only make Israel smaller and less powerful, and allow Jordan and Egypt to become bigger.
1.4.6.2. Pro: This would ultimately be good for Israel and Gaza with regard to the bad [economic conditions](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20191018-gaza-poverty-and-unemployment-rates-at-75/) in Gaza and the [never ending fight](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-gaza-vs-israel-the-never-ending-rematch-1.5255094) between the two stakeholders.
1.4.6.3. Con: Jordan does not want the headache that is the West Bank, which is why Jordan renounced all claims to it.
1.4.6.4. Con: This is a highly unlikely course of action.
1.4.6.4.1. Pro: Giving back the West Bank to Jordan will [destabilize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/17/annexing-the-west-bank-will-destabilize-jordan/) the country.
1.4.6.4.1.1. Con: Increasing the Palestinian majority in Jordan would force Jordan to democratize.
1.4.6.4.1.1.1. Con: This could backfire and cause Jordon to become more authoritarian.
1.4.6.4.1.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that the US will allow Jordan to democratize.
1.4.6.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: The current Jordanian leader, [King Abdullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan), is a [vital US ally](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33546.html).
1.4.6.5. Pro: This could benefit Israeli security, as in the current status-quo it faces constant [rocket attacks](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rocket-fired-from-gaza-intercepted-over-southern-border-communities-idf/)(The rocket fire came amid escalating Israeli-Palestinian tensions, following clashes and violence in the Old City of Jerusalem, a series of deadly Palestinian terror attacks, and stepped up IDF activity against terror groups in the West Bank.) from Gaza
1.4.6.6. Pro: Giving Gaza back to Egypt would further benefit relations between the two countries, which are already [warming significantly](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/egypts-ties-to-israel-deepen-despite-public-misgivings/)(he Egyptian government has deepened its cooperation with Israel on strategic and economic matters in order to root out the extremist threat in the Sinai Peninsula and bolster Egypt’s economy.).
1.4.7. Pro: Israel has [already legalized](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/29/an-israeli-palestinian-confederation-can-work/) many of its settlements on the West Bank. This indicates that ownership or control after annexation will not be difficult.
1.4.7.1. Pro: In [2017](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-historic-first-israel-legalizes-west-bank-outposts-with-sweeping-new-legislation/), the Israeli parliament passed a law to legalize settlements on land expropriated from private Palestinian owners.
1.4.7.2. Con: Such a legislation [openly curtails property rights](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/29/an-israeli-palestinian-confederation-can-work/) of Palestinians in the West Bank, indicating it to be inconsistent with the protections granted to occupied populations under the [Fourth Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention).
1.4.8. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.5. A single, Palestinian state.
1.5.1. Pro: The [Balfour declaration](https://www.britannica.com/event/Balfour-Declaration) should be recognized as illegitimate, and the land should be returned to the Palestinians who inhabited the land prior to 1917.
1.5.1.1. Con: This would require the displacement of almost [7 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_country). A large percentage of these were born in the region and would become stateless.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Descendants of refugees from the British Mandate of Palestine are currently stateless under [definition from UNRWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA). [All 7 million](https://www.afsc.org/resource/palestinian-refugees-and-right-return#:~:text=None%20of%20these%20displaced%20persons,refugees%20scattered%20around%20the%20world.) could then be granted passports to the new state of Palestine. And the number of stateless refugees globally would not be altered.
1.5.1.2. Con: Returning borders/control to a specific, arbitrary historic point could inflame other border disputes around the world and in this region.
1.5.2. Con: It is unlikely that Israel and it's allies would allow for the creation of a single Palestinian state without some sort of conflict, which would make it an undesirable solution to the conflict.
1.5.3. Con: The creation of a single Palestinian state would likely require some sort of conflict with the current Israeli regime, which has a [significant military force](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.php?country_id=israel)(For 2022, Israel is ranked 18 of 142 out of the countries considered for the annual GFP review. It holds a PwrIndx* score of 0.2621 \(a score of 0.0000 is considered 'perfect'\).).
1.5.3.1. Pro: Israel has successfully won a number of conflicts against Palestinian and Arab coalition forces, further reinforcing the unlikeliness of a Palestinian military victory.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: In the Israeli war of Independence, Israeli fighters defeated Arab forces, capturing [most of the land up to the old Egypt-Palestine borde](https://www.britannica.com/event/Arab-Israeli-wars)(The next day, Arab forces from Egypt, Transjordan \(Jordan\), Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon occupied the areas in southern and eastern Palestine not apportioned to the Jews by the UN partition of Palestine and then captured East Jerusalem, including the small Jewish quarter of the Old City. The stated purpose of the invasion was to restore law and order in light of British withdrawal, citing incidents such as that at Dayr Yāsīn, and a growing refugee crisis in neighbouring Arab countries. The Israelis, meanwhile, won control of the main road to Jerusalem through the Yehuda Mountains \(“Hills of Judaea”\) and successfully repulsed repeated Arab attacks. By early 1949 the Israelis had managed to occupy all of the Negev up to the former Egypt-Palestine frontier, except for the Gaza Strip.)r.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Israel successfully destroyed the Egyptian air force, and crippled Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the [Six-Day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War)(The war saw over 20,000 Arab troops killed while Israel lost fewer than 1,000 of its own. \n...\nAt the cessation of hostilities, Israel had seized the Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank \(including East Jerusalem\) from Jordan, and the Gaza Strip as well as the entire Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. Israel's international standing greatly improved in the years following the Six-Day War; the overwhelming Israeli victory had humiliated Egypt, Jordan, and Syria...).
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Israeli success in the Six-Day war was only the result of an aggressive [preemptive surprise attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War)(On 5 June, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Egyptian airfields, initially claiming that it had been attacked by Egypt, but later stating that the airstrikes were pre-emptive; the question of which side caused the war remains one of a number of controversies relating to the conflict.).
1.5.3.1.3. Con: Israel took heavy losses in the Yom-Kippur war, suffering [heavy casualties and losing key fortifications along the Suez canal](https://www.britannica.com/event/Arab-Israeli-wars)(The sporadic fighting that followed the Six-Day War again developed into full-scale war in 1973. On October 6, the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur \(thus, “Yom Kippur War”\), Israel was caught off guard by Egyptian forces crossing the Suez Canal and by Syrian forces crossing into the Golan Heights. The Arab armies showed greater aggressiveness and fighting ability than in the previous wars, and the Israeli forces suffered heavy casualties. The Israeli army, however, reversed many of its early losses and pushed its way into Syrian territory and encircled the Egyptian Third Army by crossing the Suez Canal and establishing forces on its west bank. Still, it never regained the seemingly impenetrable fortifications along the Suez Canal that Egypt had destroyed in its initial successes.).
1.5.4. Pro: The establishment of a single Palestinian state would stabilize geopolitical relations within the area, as many of Israel's neighbours are [supportive](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1859011/middle-east)(Several Arab states have expressed solidarity with Palestine amidst escalating violence in Sheikh Jarrah, Gaza and the West Bank due to Israel’s military operations against militants in the occupied territory.) of the Palestinians.
1.5.4.1. Con: Israel is beginning to [normalize their relations](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/normalising-relations-between-israel-and-its-neighbours-and-pushing-forward-and-israeli-palestinian-peace-process)(The United Kingdom has continued to support the progress made on normalising relations between Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. We hope others will follow suit for the benefit of the whole region, and we therefore welcome Friday’s statement from the Governments of Sudan, Israel and the United States of America on the normalisation of relations between Israel and Sudan.) with their neighbors, increasing stability in the region. A new Palestinian state, as well as the conflict that would likely come with its establishment, would destroy the progress made in this area.
1.5.5. Con: The creation of a single Palestinian state would likely reignite the [Fatah-Hamas conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah%E2%80%93Hamas_conflict).
1.5.6. Con: A single Palestinian state that does not include Jordan would likely reignite [The Black September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September) conflict with Jordan.
1.5.6.1. Con: Considering the unrest in the region and the strong US [military backing](https://www.bbc.com/news/57170576)(In 2020, the US gave $3.8bn \(£2.7bn\) in aid to Israel - part of a long-term, yearly commitment made under the Obama administration. Almost all of this aid was for military assistance.) of Israel, it is unlikely that Jordan would reignite any conflict.
