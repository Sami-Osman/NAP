Discussion Name: Is Feminism a Force For Good?

1. Feminism is a force for good in the world.
1.1. Pro: Feminist spaces are open and accepting places for political discussion.
1.1.1. Con: Various factions of feminism have previously attempted to deplatform and silence [other women](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/camille-paglia-uarts-left-deplatform/587125/)(“Camille Paglia should be removed from UArts faculty and replaced by a queer person of color,” an online petition declares. “If, due to tenure, it is absolutely illegal to remove her, then the University must at least offer alternate sections of the classes she teaches, instead taught by professors who respect transgender students and survivors of sexual assault.” Regardless, the students behind the petition want her banned from holding speaking events or selling books on campus. In their telling, her ideas “are not merely ‘controversial,’ they are dangerous.”) whose opinions they don't agree with, including others in the movement.
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/5/20840101/terfs-radical-feminists-gender-critical) \(TERFs\) limit discussion by gatekeeping feminist spaces, excluding trans and non-binary people.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: TERFs are a [minority](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/reddit-ovarit-the-donald/617320/)(TERFs constitute “a minority of a minority of feminists,” says Grace Lavery, a UC Berkeley literature professor and writer. Nevertheless, this tiny group has attracted a disproportionate amount of attention in the past several years, in large part thanks to social-media platforms. Anti-trans feminists have a presence in many mainstream online spaces, including Twitter, “radfem” Tumblr, the Black women’s beauty forum Lipstick Alley, and the British parenting forum Mumsnet.) [actively decried](https://www.them.us/story/lesbians-join-the-fight-against-terfs) by many more progressive and younger feminist factions. Silencing within feminist movements is multidirectional and should not be attributed to a single group.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: TERFs often appeal to [right-wing](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/26/the-free-speech-panic-censorship-how-the-right-concocted-a-crisis) fears of [identity politics](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/may/22/kathleen-stock-taboo-around-gender-identity-chilling-effect-on-academics)(Stock is at pains to say she is not a transphobe, and also that she is sympathetic to the idea that many people feel they are not in the “right” body. What she says she opposes, though, is the institutionalisation of the idea that gender identity is all that matters – that how you identify automatically confers all the entitlements of that sex. And she believes that increasingly in universities and the wider world, that is a view that cannot be challenged.\n\n“There’s a taboo against saying this, but it’s what I believe,” she says. “It’s fair enough if people want to disagree with me, but this is what I think.”), and political correctness gone wrong; when progressives note that TERF views may be damaging \([p. 692](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0038026120934713)(Charlotte Jones and Jen Slater show how the very spaces that gender\ncritical feminists politicise as safe for cis women become sites of danger for trans and non-binary people. They argue that trans-exclusionary politics and practices do nothing to improve toilet access, put trans people at a greater risk of violence, and contribute to a harmful homogenisation of ‘womanhood’.)\), TERFs assert their status as [victims](https://www.salon.com/2021/10/09/dave-chappelle-terf-transphobia-joyce-carol-oates/) closing off conversation.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: TERF [academics](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/nov/03/kathleen-stock-says-she-quit-university-post-over-medieval-ostracism) in the UK have claimed that they were silenced for their "gender critical" beliefs, echoing a previous [trend](https://theconversation.com/four-centuries-after-galileo-was-silenced-uk-students-are-still-curbing-free-speech-54935) of no-platforming transphobic speakers by university student unions.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: [TERFs](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/5/20840101/terfs-radical-feminists-gender-critical)(Earlier this year, Lavery decided to step into the debate because, as a tenured professor, she felt like she was one of the few trans academics in a position to push back on the growing anti-trans rhetoric she was seeing around her. After initially dipping her toe into the discourse, she wrote a piece that was critical of Stock. Two gender-critical journalists shared Stock’s response, and that’s when Lavery really started feeling the heat.\n\n“It led to a massive explosion of online harassment, which I just didn’t see coming at all,” she said. “People in the seemingly hundreds started trying to find me and just write insulting things about me. And that escalated to the degree that it was totally out of control. At one point, people were posting the names and contact details and photographs — not only of me but also of my colleagues at UC Berkeley — online.”) have protested, campaigned against, and [doxxed](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3572910/what-is-doxing-weaponizing-personal-information.html)(Doxing \(or doxxing\) is the practice of revealing personal information about someone online without their consent.) other feminists, keeping them silent for fear of reprisal. Such actions, along with their [relative power](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/19/21029874/jk-rowling-transgender-tweet-terf)(Wednesday’s ruling has already been seized upon by the usual anti-trans voices who are propping it up as the latest example of the alleged suppression of free speech. It has become increasingly common for upper-class white people to express anti-trans views.), are likely to do a lot of harm.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: TERFs have been [physically violent](https://www.transadvocate.com/that-time-terfs-beat-radfems-for-protecting-a-trans-woman-from-assault_n_14382.htm) towards trans women attending lesbian and bisexual visibility conferences and summits; this is a far more serious issue than the [cancelled talks](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/23/petition-urges-cardiff-university-to-cancel-germain-greer-lecture) and beliefs they decry as [harming](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/30/feminists-anti-trans-idea-sex-gender-oppression) feminism.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Though TERFs claim that they are not [trans-exclusionary](https://theconversation.com/why-the-words-we-use-matter-when-describing-anti-trans-activists-130990), they problematically include trans men in their definition of a woman and propagate attitudes that cause [harm](https://theconversation.com/transgender-hate-crimes-are-on-the-rise-even-in-canada-121541).
1.1.1.2. Con: Some feminists advocate for activisms that allow open conversation, frame conflict \(within reason\) as [productive](https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/C/Conflict-Is-Not-Abuse), and push the movement forward.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Whilst [historic feminists](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/stopes_marie_carmichael.shtml) held highly [problematic](https://theconversation.com/marie-stopes-opened-the-uks-first-birth-control-clinic-100-years-ago-she-was-also-a-eugenicist-157182)(She was also a fierce advocate for eugenics. This is the practice or advocacy of controlled selective breeding to improve the “quality” of a population’s genetic composition. She called for the “hopelessly rotten and racially diseased” to be sterilised and was vehemently opposed to interracial marriage. While her more famous publications were relatively benign, the bulk of her writing reveals a woman preoccupied with the “unfit” who was convinced by the powers of birth control to improve the biological quality of Britain’s population.) views, feminism has demonstrated its commitment to evolution and inclusion by [distancing](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/17/marie-stopes-charity-changes-name-in-break-with-founders-view-on-eugenics)(“We’re absolutely not trying to erase her from history, or what she did,” said Simon Cooke, MSI’s chief executive. “For me, she was an acknowledged family planning pioneer, an extraordinary women who broke down barriers … but we really need to look forward and not back. It’s the right moment for us.”\n\nCooke said the board began seriously discussing a name change in November last year, but that the events of 2020, particularly the Black Lives Matter movement, had propelled change. “The name of the organisation has been a topic of discussion for many years and the events of 2020 have reaffirmed that changing our name now is the right decision,” he said.) itself from these ideologies.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Some [female figureheads](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2021/10/13/why-call-her-daddy-host-alexandra-cooper-says-groupthink-has-spiraled/?sh=132ec754f5be)(After Forbes invited “Call Her Daddy” host and cofounder Alexandra Cooper to speak at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Detroit, editors received notes from some of Cooper’s listeners urging a reconsideration. The messaging in Cooper’s podcast, they alleged, is unhealthy for young people; it promotes a toxic hook-up culture and is misogynistic.\n\n“I get that all the time,” Cooper said of this criticism from the Under 30 stage on Tuesday. “The concept, I think, in the beginning of cancel culture was, ‘Let's have it be accountability culture.’ I think unfortunately what’s happened is the concept of groupthink has spiraled, and so you have people who don’t have a large platform \[trying\] to take down people who have large platforms. I think they enjoy it, unfortunately.”) are targeted by a limiting groupthink that attempts to cancel them prior to any direct conflict or dialogue. This indicates that on balance, feminists may not push for open conversation.
1.1.1.3. Con: Some intolerance is [necessary](https://www.openculture.com/2019/03/does-democracy-demand-the-tolerance-of-the-intolerant-karl-poppers-paradox.html)(Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.) in order to create a tolerant society; a group that sets no hard boundaries is likely to find itself undermined. As such, it is legitimate for feminists to occasionally deplatform others.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: If feminists did not deplatform others, many women would be silenced. The boundaries feminists set are protective and ultimately facilitate better conversations.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Deplatforming serves as a [necessary](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/the-ongoing-challenge-to-define-free-speech/counterspeech-in-response-to-free-speech/)(In short, the Court’s foregoing decisions reflect its changing notions of free speech, which have expanded protection for both the messages that speech conveys and the media by which the speech is transmitted. In these lines of cases, the Court has consistently held that the constitutionally permissible response to speech conveying controversial, disfavored views is “counterspeech,” not censorship—more speech, not silence. And here is where some “changing notions of free speech in our society” can clearly be discerned: in the increasingly vigorous and widespread counterspeech that is being undertaken by so many members of our society. In recent years, we have witnessed a remarkable and bipartisan outpouring of speech and peaceful dem­onstrations that have denounced hateful ideologies while celebrating our nation’s renewed commitments to equality, inclusivity, and intergroup harmony.) means of curtailing dangerous speech outside of the use of state powers; it is the only middle ground that protects both individuals and civil liberties.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: The line between what is tolerable and what isn't may be incredibly difficult to discern, especially within an activist space that aims to consistently [evolve](https://harvardpolitics.com/evolution-feminism/) in its approach. As such, deplatforming should not be allowed.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: It is hypocritical for ostensibly open spaces to refuse entry to some based on their [political views](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/06/can-you-conservative-feminist-experts-weigh/374061002/); such actions may have a greater chilling effect than any dissent that could otherwise occur.
1.1.1.4. Pro: [Pro-life women](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/01/17/pro_life_feminist_group_new_wave_feminists_removed_from_women_s_march_partnership.html) often find themselves excluded from mainstream feminist movements.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Feminists [fight](https://www.calvertjournal.com/features/show/12847/first-feminist-activists-poland)(While Orzeszkowa would probably recognise many of the struggles facing Polish women today, she would also recognise such solidarity. In fact, for Polish women alive around the time of Orzeszkowa’s novel, the fight for women’s rights was equally active. Several influential early Polish feminists campaigned for women’s education, the right to vote, access to abortion, and supported sexual minorities long before these issues were widely known or accepted in society. And as a result, they had a significant and pioneering impact on Polish life and culture at the time.) for bodily autonomy; it is not in-fighting when one party acts directly counter to one of the major propositions of feminism.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Feminism should be about the [empowerment](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/05/pro-life-women-abortion-feminism-human-rights-supreme-court-column/1122263002/)(Young anti-abortion women today also push back on the idea that abortion is feminist. “There is nothing empowering about killing a child,” Allie Beth Stuckey, 27, told me. Stuckey, a conservative Christian pundit, added: “Too many women have been manipulated into believing the pro-choice movement is for them, when nothing could be further from reality.”\n\nFeminism's goal is women's empowerment and liberation. Why should we sacrifice millions of lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society to achieve these goals? Feminism is supposed to be about women living the lives they choose, not women ending lives.) of all women, not only the power to end the lives of unborn babies.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: It is inherently impossible to be both pro-life and a feminist; a lack of reproductive bodily autonomy [subjugates](https://www.bustle.com/p/why-you-cant-be-pro-life-a-feminist-31056)(You can't be pro-life and a feminist because the pro-life movement inherently advocates for the subjugation of women, and there's no way to get around that fact.\n\nThe Women's March released an official statement regarding New Wave Feminists on Monday, saying that it was sorry for the "error" in including the pro-life group as one of its partners. "The Women's March platform is pro-choice and that has been our stance since day one," the organizers said in a post shared on various social media sites. "We look forward to marching on behalf of individuals who share the view that women deserve the right to make their own reproductive decisions.") women.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Pro-life feminist groups were denied partnerships with the Women's March on Washington 2017; several groups were [rejected](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/22/14335292/womens-march-washington-abortion-pro-life-feminists) outright, and another that was initially approved was later [removed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/pro-lifers-womens-march/513104/)(On Monday afternoon, after the publication of this article, the Women’s March organizers removed the New Wave Feminists from their website and list of partners. “The Women’s March’s platform is pro-choice and that has been our stance from day one,” the organizers said in a statement. “The anti-choice organization in question is not a partner of the Women's March on Washington. We apologize for this error.”).
1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Regardless of the official status or limited participation of pro-life feminist groups, [thousands](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/pro-lifers-womens-march/513104/) of pro-life women marched in Washington.
1.1.1.4.3. Pro: Pro-life women frequently find their voices [crowded out](https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/100-years-after-the-19th-amendment-pro-life-women-are-still-treated-unequal) of discussions regarding abortion and choose to avoid attending marches and similar types of events in protest.
1.1.1.5. Pro: [Sex workers](https://bostonreview.net/articles/me-too-deja-vu/)(The sex wars were not solely focused on pornography, however. Conflicts blazed over sex work, between those who wished to abolish it as sexual slavery \(e.g., Kathleen Barry, Female Sexual Slavery, 1979\), and those who advocated labor organizing to improve working conditions \(Sex Work: Writings by Women in the Sex Industry, 1987\).) are often [excluded](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/sex-workers-prostitution-amsterdam-feminism-red-light-district-a8863926.html) from feminist spaces.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Sex workers are more likely to be included in feminist spaces than patriarchal ones.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Most of the countries that have legalized sex work have done so under the [political leadership of men](https://prostitution.procon.org/historical-timeline/#2000-present).
1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Evangelical women often simultaneously uphold the [patriarchy](https://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/mutuality-blog-magazine/how-american-evangelicalism-has-been-weaponized-against) and weaponise their gender to [harm](https://theconversation.com/evangelical-women-are-shaping-public-attitudes-about-sex-work-89129) sex workers.
1.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Sex workers are often [presented](https://slutever.com/shaming-sex-work-hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold-pretty-woman/) in reductive and sexist ways in traditional media; feminist media is often more [respectful](https://www.intomore.com/film/lizzie-bordens-working-girls-gave-sex-workers-voice/).
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Often feminists claim that enacting sex work negative legislature will protect the women working in the industry, despite [persistent refutations](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/beyond-trafficking-and-slavery/the-false-feminism-of-criminalising-sex-workers-clients/)(So-called feminist arguments around sex work are harder to dismiss than religious fundamentalism, which condemns prostitution, abortion and all sex outside marriage. Some of the women putting forward those arguments have a reputation for speaking out against violence against women. But their exclusion of sex worker voices – and, usually, of trans women – calls that commitment into question. In the UK, feminist MPs in the Labour party like Sarah Champion and Jess Phillips, who are openly contemptuous of any sex worker who doesn’t fit their description of a ‘prostituted woman’, frame their arguments as feminist. And yet they are campaigning to increase the criminalisation of sex work via the criminalisation of clients. Such a development would worsen our situation and directly threaten our lives, as any sex worker-led organisation in the world will tell you. We have no choice but to deal with them.) of this claim \([p. 2](https://www.nswp.org/sites/nswp.org/files/sg_to_challenging_nordic_model_prf03.pdf)(The ‘Nordic Model’ is used to describe the approach – first promoted and implemented in Sweden – of criminalising the purchase of sex under a broader ideological framework that sees all sex work as violence. The Nordic Model aims to eradicate sex work both in the short term, via criminalisation and fines for buying sex, and in the long term, by creating an understanding of sex work as inherently harmful to both the individual and society. Under this framework all sex workers are viewed as victims lacking agency, and sex work is seen as something that is impossible to choose or to consent to. \(pg.2\))\).
1.1.1.5.3. Con: The feminist left is quite divided over sex work; some feminists find it acceptable, others [question](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/02/the-divide-over-prostitution-on-the-feminist-left/471168/) whether the women working in the industry have much of a choice.
1.1.2. Pro: Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues.
1.1.2.1. Con: New perspectives are not necessarily good perspectives.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Innovation through new perspectives can be [reckless](https://m.economictimes.com/tech/ites/reckless-innovation-bigger-threat-to-tech-companies-than-rules/articleshow/68105010.cms) and [short-sighted](https://www.sparkts.net/post/can-you-inspire-innovation)(Because sometimes you have to sacrifice short-term goals to achieve long-term ones. Sometimes you have small failures on the road to success. And when those small failures or steps backward occur, that is okay because the important thing is the overall progress forwards towards something bigger.), driving people towards negative long-term outcomes. As such, new views should be approached with skepticism.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Traditions can be incredibly [comforting](https://www.bustle.com/articles/131377-why-we-love-traditions-according-to-science), offering a refuge in troubled times. When these are disrupted by new ideologies, people may feel more vulnerable.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: [Certain traditions](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/traditions-are-not-bad-but-they-need-to-evolve-constantly/articleshow/56838173.cms) - maintained as part of the status quo - are jarring and can make people feel as uncomfortable as changes to society.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: Existing perspectives often exist due to [path dependency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/path-dependency.asp)(Path dependency explains the continued use of a product or practice based on historical preference or use. A company may persist in the use of a product or practice even if newer, more efficient alternatives are available. Path dependency occurs because it is often easier or more cost-effective to continue along an already set path than to create an entirely new one.) and enshrine oppressive action by removing people's ability to push back; when new movements disrupt this, whilst initially causing unrest, the world is better overall.
1.1.2.2. Con: [Liberalism](https://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/br-liberalism-and-suffrage.html) predicates equality under the law, and has done so [outside](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/francois-poulain-radical-feminism/619499/) of direct feminist influence.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Unlike liberalism, feminism focuses on a specific group. This switches the terms of the argument from universal to group-based recognition which, in the long run, may work against equality.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: The tenets of liberalism do not directly support women's emancipation such that it has been possible for liberal thinkers to [oppose](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/liberalism-is-no-friend-of-gender-equality/) gender based equality.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Feminists offer cultural critiques on art, movies, television, and other cultural phenomena, helping us better understand them \([p. 180](https://www.lkouniv.ac.in/site/writereaddata/siteContent/202004150927005180nishi_showalter_fem_crit_wilderness.pdf)(Since then, the expressed goals have not been notably unified. Black critics protest the "massive silence" of feminist criticism about black and Third-World women writers and call for a black feminist aesthetic that would deal with both racial and sexual politics. Marxist feminists wish to focus on class along with gender as a crucial determinant of literary production. Literary historians want to uncover\na lost tradition. Critics trained in deconstructionist methodologies wish to "synthesize a literary criticism that is both textual and feminist." Freudian and Lacanian critics want to theorize about women's relationship to language and signification.)\).
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Most celebrated works of art or literature prior to feminist criticism normalised patriarchal and androcentric standards \([p. 25](http://www.davidpublisher.com/Public/uploads/Contribute/567a405728df6.pdf)(The outlook of sexual difference at the genesis of feminist literary criticism moves from an appraisal of patriarchalism and androcentrism within some of the most revered male authors of the literary canon, to the profiling of a specific difference within a literary work created by women. But difference in feminism, which generates a theory of sexual difference, will appear above all in France and will make real inroads by the end of the 1970s.)\). Feminist writings offered the other side of the story.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Cynthia Enloe added a [feminist perspective](https://www.clarku.edu/departments/womens-and-gender-studies/people/professor-cynthia-enloe/) to international relations theory when she focused on the role of military bases, diplomats' wives, and backlashes to nationalism.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: The [Venus of Willendorf](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/what-did-the-venus-of-willendorf-originally-represent)(While male anthropologists of the past two centuries may have assumed these figures were made by men looking at women, McCoid says the shape of many of the figurines suggests they were likely self-portraits of the women that carved them. Given that mirrors hadn’t been invented yet, a woman carving her own shape would be looking down at her own body, resulting in the perspective of exaggerated breasts and bellies and narrower lower legs.\n...\nArchaeologists have only turned up a small number of statuettes that survived, and it's possible that greater numbers once existed and were used by women to depict the various stages of pregnancy and childbirth.) was originally assumed to be a fertility figure, meant to inspire men, until a woman noted that it was more likely to be a self-portrait.
1.1.2.3.4. Con: There are few feminist texts in school curricula, which denotes the lack of an ability to enact widespread understanding and change within society \([p. 110](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40003444)\).
1.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Nearly [one-quarter](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/21/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/) of adults in the US did not read a book in 2020 and nearly [one-third](https://readingagency.org.uk/about/impact/002-reading-facts-1/) of adults in the UK do not read in their free time; if a feminist text is not part of required reading in the classroom, it is unlikely that it would ever be read.
1.1.2.3.4.2. Con: As reading is often [segregated](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/au/entry/men-and-women-dont-read-from-the-same-page-on-books_a_21652348) along gendered lines, male curriculum writers may be biased away from feminist texts. This does not mean that such perspectives are not valuable.
1.1.2.3.5. Con: Given the [unscientific](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/new-sokal-hoax/572212/)(Over the past 12 months, three scholars—James Lindsay, Helen Pluckrose, and Peter Boghossian—wrote 20 fake papers using fashionable jargon to argue for ridiculous conclusions, and tried to get them placed in high-profile journals in fields including gender studies, queer studies, and fat studies. Their success rate was remarkable: By the time they took their experiment public late on Tuesday, seven of their articles had been accepted for publication by ostensibly serious peer-reviewed journals. Seven more were still going through various stages of the review process. Only six had been rejected.) nature of feminist thought, regardless of the critiques offered, people may be skeptical when engaging with them.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Feminists have consistently been involved with campaigns for [healthier eating habits](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226342486_Carol_J_Adams_The_Sexual_Politics_of_Meat_A_Feminist-Vegetarian_Critical_Theory_Tenth_Anniversary_Edition_Kathryn_Paxton_George_Animal_Vegetable_or_Woman_A_Feminist_Critique_of_Ethical_Vegetarianism_M)(Consequently, The Sexual Politics of Meat provides powerful arguments to suggest a convergence of interest between feminism and ethical vegetarianism. And it provides an overdue voice for the unheard concerns of feminist vegetarians about the contradiction between campaigning against one set of injustices while participating in another.), and have worked to reduce the desire to eat meat with every meal.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: By pushing back against the overconsumption of meat, feminists have helped save countless people from [coronary artery disease](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-07-21-red-and-processed-meat-linked-increased-risk-heart-disease-oxford-study-shows) and other diseases.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: A number of feminist icons began the fight for [animal rights and veganism](https://www.vegfest.co.uk/2019/09/01/women-pioneers-movement-rarely-shadows/) in the early 20th century.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: Campaigns for vegetarianism and veganism can often be [colonial](https://civileats.com/2020/08/26/is-the-vegan-movement-ready-to-reckon-with-racism/) and [ignore](https://www.mcgilldaily.com/2017/11/decolonizing-veganism/) sustainable indigenous food production practices in favour of a monolithic perspective on food. Feminist involvement therefore may not be positive.
1.1.2.5. Pro: [Feminism](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210818-what-does-sex-positivity-mean)(For some, like writer and producer Karley Sciortino, understanding sex positivity grew out of learning about feminism after someone called her London-based sex blog, Slutever, “feminist” in the early 2000s. She got interested in the writings of Camille Paglia, a “pro-sex feminist” who didn’t discriminate against sex workers, porn and women who wore make-up. To Paglia and Sciortino, sex and looking sexy represented power “instead of submission to the male gaze”, says Sciortino. In other words, Sciortino’s idea of sex positivity was about inclusion of sex workers and women who wore their sexuality on their sleeves, categories that have historically been discriminated against in feminist circles.) has helped women to express their [sexuality](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-positive-meaning) more openly and deconstruct the taboos encompassing nudity, sensuality, romance, and connectedness.

Pro: Some feminists have readily [embraced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/feminist-pursuit-good-sex.html)(These women were absolutely pro-sex, pro-pleasure and pro-freedom. “We’ve got to learn to sleep with people because we want them,” one woman said in a consciousness-raising session transcribed by the author of “The Dialectic of Sex,” Shulamith Firestone, in 1968. “Not to prove anything to them, not to make them feel better about their masculinity, not out of weakness or inability to say no, but simply because we want to.”\n\nBut they also understood that if rape and harassment were political, so was bad sex. In a 1980 essay, the radical feminist Alix Kates Shulman remembered that in those early sessions, “sex was a central and explosive subject to which we continually returned”; feminists “used their sexual discontents to help them understand the power relations between men and women.”) the topic of sex, evaluating how it is discursively mediated. This opens space to discuss all forms of sex and create more [just systems of desire](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/amia-srinivasan-interview/)(A recognition that who is, and is not, considered sexually or romantically desirable is shaped in part by systems of oppression—heteronormativity, racism, ableism, and so on. There are lots of examples of this: the romantic and sexual marginalization of certain women of color, the sexual fetishization of East Asian women, the racial discrimination that South Asian and East Asian and femme gay men often face from other gay men. These are all examples of what a political philosopher would call the maldistribution of sexual desire. The goal shouldn’t be to make sure there’s a hierarchy of desirability that doesn’t cut across racial lines; we should just stop thinking of sex as having a hierarchy at all. It shouldn’t be thought of as a good that confers status, but as an activity that we do with other people.).
1.1.2.5.3. Con: Not all feminists have liberatory views of sex; historically, [radical anti-sex work feminists](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/feminists-against-the-first-amendment/305051/)(Of course. while feminists blamed patriarchy for pornography, moral majoritarians blamed feminism and other humanist rebellions.

1.1.2.5.3.2.

The hearings before the Minneapolis City Council galvanized debate and demonstrations. In one incident, a woman protesting pornography and its degrading aspects toward women, set herself on fire by a downtown news-stand.\n...\nThey filed a legal brief attacking the ordinance on the ground that it reinforced sexist stereotypes. In a strongly worded rebuttal, MacKinnon denounced the group as being apologists for male supremacists.\n\nThe Minneapolis antipornography ordinance twice failed to pass.).

Such efforts include, but are not limited to, voter ID laws, inaccessible polling places, voter roll purges, voter intimidation efforts, limited access to early voting, and disinformation campaigns. The persistence of this discrimination is in large part due to the weakening of the VRA, particularly in light of recent events such as the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision Shelby County v. Holder—gutting key VRA voter protection provisions—and the lifting of a consent decree on the Republican National Committee in 2017, which voting rights advocates fear may result in more frequent instances of voter intimidation and suppression.) minority women and kept millions from voting in the US.
1.1.3.1.4.

The “second shift” — taking care of kids after work — cuts into time spent following up on news and eventually voting. Low-income nonvoters face housing and food insecurities too, exacerbated for women because of the gender pay gap.). This means fewer key issues may be heard in these spaces.
1.1.3.1.5.

1.1.3.3. Pro: As women gain equal rights, societies become more [peaceful](https://www.inclusivesecurity.org/publication/why-women-inclusive-security-and-peaceful-societies/), making it more likely that the voices of others are considered in politics.
1.1.3.3.1.

1.1.3.4. Pro: Feminism keeps women's rights in popular discourse and at the top of people's minds.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Banners for feminist marches are often [eye-catching](https://www.stylist.co.uk/visible-women/womens-march-london-2018-times-up-signs-rally/185008), [drawing attention](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2018/jan/21/best-signs-from-womens-march-london-pictures-donald-trump) both at the time and at later [art exhibitions](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/women-making-history-activism-exhibition/).

1.1.3.5. Pro: Feminism helps breed recognition and support for under-represented female leaders and ideas.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that women particularly benefit from other women holding leadership positions.

1.1.4.3. Con: Intersectional feminism [promotes the welfare](https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/columnist/294500/intersectionality-the-new-caste-system/) of non-white, non-heterosexual people over white, heterosexual men and women.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Intersectionality has only existed for [30 years](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination). Yet, the welfare of white, heterosexual people has been the standard for the vast majority of human history; those that do not adhere to traditional norms deserve an equitable voice as well.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The concept of "whiteness" was first used to claim superiority of the "white race" in the 1600s when the British introduced the [concept of racism](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/20/the-invention-of-whiteness-long-history-dangerous-idea)(Still, with only slightly exaggerated precision, we can say that one of the most crucial developments in “the discovery of personal whiteness” took place during the second half of the 17th century, on the peripheries of the still-young British empire. What’s more, historians such as Oscar and Mary Handlin, Edmund Morgan and Edward Rugemer have largely confirmed Du Bois’s suspicion that while xenophobia appears to be fairly universal among human groupings, the invention of a white racial identity was motivated from the start by a need to justify the enslavement of Africans. In the words of Eric Williams, a historian who later became the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, “slavery was not born of racism: rather, racism was the consequence of slavery”.) to the Americas during the [trans-Atlantic slave trade](https://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/africanpassageslowcountryadapt/introductionatlanticworld/trans_atlantic_slave_trade). Prior to that, intersectional thought would not have been necessary.
1.1.4.3.2.

Feminist writer Zoe Samudzi reminds us that “intersectionality is such a vital framework for understanding systems of power, because ‘woman’ is not a catchall category that alone defines all our relationships to power”. A black woman may experience misogyny and racism, but she will experience misogyny differently from a white woman and racism differently from a black man.

1.1.4.4.1.

Womanism is not just feminism for women from minorities; it is based in our spirituality, honouring our foremothers and a desire to support both men and women. While womanism at its heart is pro-woman, it is also about understanding the communal value of all people of colour.).
1.1.4.4.2. Con: Black women played an [integral leadership role](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marianneschnall/2020/08/05/its-time-the-truth-be-told-about-black-womens-leadership-in-the-fight-for-the-vote/) in the women's suffrage movement; yet, their contributions are rarely mentioned alongside their white feminist counterparts.

1.1.5. Con: The voices and opinions of men, even those attempting to be allies, are often excluded from feminist discussions.
1.1.5.1. Con: Men have [thanked](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/the-good-men-inside-the-all-male-group-taking-on-modern-masculinity) feminism for its help and joined the movement.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: A previous leader left the feminist movement to become a [men's rights activist](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/warren-farrell-mens-rights-movement-feminism-misogyny-trolls/)(Farrell is widely considered to be the father of the men’s rights movement. In a series of books published since the 1980s, he has made the case that the primary victims of gender-based discrimination are men—casualties of a society that relies on their sacrifices while ignoring their suffering. He blames this phenomenon for a litany of woes, from the plight of blue-collar workers to the state of veterans’ health care and rising suicide rates among young men. Many of today’s men’s rights activists view Farrell’s 1993 book, The Myth of Male Power: Why Men Are the Disposable Sex, as their touchstone, and the online forums where they congregate are steeped in Farrell’s ideas.), eventually viewing women as the true controllers of society. This clearly demonstrates the extent to which feminism is alienating to men.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Feminist men and women are able to mutually support one another to create great progress; this is [celebrated](https://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/fathersday.html) through events like [International Men's Day](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2013/nov/19/feminist-international-mens-day).
1.1.5.2. Con: Men, even allies, can sometimes make the mistake of fighting sexism on behalf of women, instead of alongside women - it is legitimate for feminists to push back against this \([p. 646](https://xyonline.net/sites/xyonline.net/files/Drury%2C%20Allies%20against%20sexism%202014.pdf)(One important caveat in the study of allies is the balance between men working alongside women to confront sexism versus men working on behalf of women, with the later broaching the territory of paternalistic helping and benevolent sexism. Although seemingly positive on the surface, paternalistic helping can be condescending and threatening to its supposed beneficiaries \(Becker et al., 2011\).)\).
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Some feminist allied men may follow a paternalistic instinct to protect women, paradoxically reinforcing gender stereotypes and sexism \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6978718/pdf/fpsyg-10-02988.pdf)(However, paternalistic goals can also lead men to confront sexism. Good et al. \(2016\) found that the duty to protect women may be one of the motives that lead men to confront sexism, thus paradoxically reinforcing the status quo. Understanding the motivational processes underlying male confrontation of sexism is essential for determining when such confrontation may help or hinder gender inequality.)\).
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Male feminists are often [maligned](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/the-problem-with-fake-male-feminists) and depicted as having [ulterior motives](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/femme-fatale/article/2017/3/23/hu-beware-male-feminist/)(Recently, Saturday Night Live produced a skit called “Girl at a Bar” where a woman sitting alone at a bar is repeatedly approached by self-proclaimed feminist men—“not gross guys trying to hit on you or anything”—who make it clear, through their pussyhats and their feminist T-shirts, that they are not one of those “skeazy guys” at a bar. However, after successfully convincing the woman of their feminist credentials, these men use the opportunity make a sexual advance. And when she gently rebuffs their advances, these men become angry, calling her a “bitch” and complaining that “it’s not fair.”\n\nThis is the “woke misogynist” that Nona Willis Aronowitz wrote about. This is the self-proclaimed feminist man who proudly attends the Women’s March and reads Judith Butler and casually throws around terms like “gender performativity,” but who also harasses, talks over, belittles, and sexually assaults women.) for their political engagement; this limits discourse, and may be done disingenuously.

1.1.5.3.3. Con: Men who are encouraged to join feminism and treated as important actors for making change are more likely to report intent to act. This may inspire more long term inclusion and improve feminism \([p. 2](https://www.readcube.com/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02988)(Subašić et al. \(2018\) similarly found that considering men as agents of change toward gender equality increases men’s collective action intentions, as well as feminist solidarity and the perceived illegitimacy of gender inequality. In addition, researchers recently showed a positive relationship between men’s feminist identification and their willingness to take part in feminist actions)\).
1.1.5.4. Pro: Some men believe that politically correct men and feminists have [excluded](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/19/philip-daviestory-mp-politically-correct-males-pander-to-militant-feminists) them from conversations regarding mental health and well-being.

They also viewed women as confounding and more expensive test subjects because of their fluctuating hormone levels.

Suicide rates are often [higher](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190313-why-more-men-kill-themselves-than-women)(But men may be less likely to admit when they feel vulnerable, whether to themselves, friends, or a GP. They also can be more reticent than women to see a doctor. A UK British Medical Journal study found general primary care consultation rates were 32% lower in men than women. \(Consultation rates for depression, assessed by whether patients received antidepressant prescriptions, were 8% lower in men than women\).\n\n"Men seek help for mental health less often,” Harkavy-Friedman says. “It's not that men don't have the same issues as women – but they're a little less likely to know they have whatever stresses or mental health conditions that are putting them at greater risk for suicide.") in men as a result and poor risk communication may be contributing factor.

Men perceived a crisis in confidence in the health care system, and felt ignored and frustrated, and these emotions could be summarized in the core category “mentally pinioned” illustrating the men’s inability to act according to their own interests \[23\].)\).

It is possible, however, that the explanations are rooted in a lack of sympathy for men because of male power and privilege and, in particular, the extent of male violence \(especially against women\). There might be a belief that men should take responsibility for their risk-taking and reluctance to seek help for health problems. Historically, particularly among clinicians, there has been an assumption that men’s health is largely about urology with a focus on prostate health, testicular cancer, sexual dysfunctions and hypogonadism. There has also been a lack of knowledge among health professionals generally about how to engage men effectively combined with pessimism about the possibility of achieving change.)\).
1.2.1.4.3. Con: Major campaigns, like [Movember](https://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/movember/), decrease the stigma of poor health amongst men and raise awareness of potentially lethal illnesses.

Schwartz, a married couple who are both psychiatrists and professors at Harvard Medical School, observed that it was common for men to form closer bonds with their spouses at the expense of other social connections. And, over their lifespans, men tended to lose the connections they did have with male friends, depriving them of the inoculating effect of social ties—which have been shown to increase happiness, help people cope with trauma, and extend longevity. Olds and Schwartz noted that men don’t work as hard as women at maintaining friendships—and more importantly, they don’t work as hard at making new friends; women are generally more likely to replace their fading friendships with new ones.) to isolate themselves and limit their efforts in friendships to avoid homophobic stereotypes.

1.2.1.4.4.3. Pro: Men often engage in [self-surveillance](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-8-56#Sec5)(The nexus between knowing one's body, recognising that a health problem exists and being able to 'fix' a health problem is complex. The majority of the men in our study approached help seeking in a conscious manner – it was not just something they did, but something they thought about. Our participants consistently discussed the need to make an informed decision when opting to seek help. Previous literature has suggested that informed choices are based on relevant knowledge, consistent with the decision maker's values, and can be behaviourally implemented \[33\]. To make an informed decision our participants asked questions and gathered information about their health concerns.) to identify issues prior to seeking healthcare, yet appropriate risk communication that encourages and scaffolds this process is limited \([p. 9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560804/pdf/10.1177_1557988319856739.pdf)(Scholars have called for health education and promotion programs that consider masculine gender scripts in program planning \(Gast & Peak, 2011\) yet progress in that direction has been slow. This study demonstrates that masculine norms influence and operate at multiple levels of health-care-seeking behavior, and that health education and prevention programs should address these concerns at all three levels.)\).
1.2.1.4.5. Con: Men receive disproportionately more healthcare funding compared to women - though they are not discussed, they are researched \([p. 956](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290307/pdf/jwh.2020.8682.pdf)(We find that in nearly three-quarters of the cases where a disease afflicts primarily one gender, the funding pattern favors males, in that either the disease affects more women and is underfunded \(with respect to burden\), or the disease affects more men and is overfunded. Moreover, the disparity between actual funding and that which is commensurate with burden is nearly twice as large for diseases that favor males versus those that favor females. A chi-square test yields a p-value of 0.015, suggesting that our conclusions are representative of the full NIH disease portfolio.)\).
1.2.1.5. Con: In the US, [100+](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml) male infants die each year due to circumcision, yet some feminists [disregard](https://theconversation.com/like-fgm-cut-foreskins-should-be-a-feminist-issue-20328)(Some feminists interpret comparison as an offensive trivialisation of the harm done to women,) male genital mutilation.
1.2.1.5.1.

1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Feminists may disregard circumcision as a site for advocacy due to the [normalisation](https://theconversation.com/like-fgm-cut-foreskins-should-be-a-feminist-issue-20328) of the practice, regardless of the associated harms.
1.2.1.6.

1.2.1.6.1. Con: Ovarian cancer receives [less funding](https://www.curetoday.com/view/pink-is-not-the-only-color-that-matters) than breast cancer; it is unlikely that discrepancies in cancer research funding come from a preference of women to men, but rather the social role of the [breast](https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/11/breast-cancer-campaigns/)(“Save the tatas!” “Save second base!” “I love boobies!”\n\nMany breast cancer awareness campaigns seem to focus on breasts instead of on cancer or, you know, on the patients themselves.\n\nI get it: Breasts are great. This is, in part, what makes breast cancer activism so marketable. Breasts are sexualized without being too sexual; we can talk about them openly on national television and radio while still appealing to the heterosexual male gaze.).
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: In the UK, men have a [higher](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk#heading-One) risk of developing prostate cancer than women do of developing breast cancer.
1.2.1.6.2.1.

1.2.1.6.3.1. Con: The lack of social media engagement and support behind prostate cancer awareness may stem from men's refusal to discuss their health issues for [fear of appearing weak](https://www.cureus.com/articles/47045-using-google-trends-and-twitter-for-prostate-cancer-awareness-a-comparative-analysis-of-prostate-cancer-awareness-month-and-breast-cancer-awareness-month)(Additionally, because evidence suggests that many men are not comfortable discussing health issues, these men may be less likely to advocate for men’s health online or at other events during PCAM. A survey by Cleveland Clinic’s health campaign “MENtion It” found that only 10% of men were willing to discuss their cancer diagnosis with a friend, and only 54% felt comfortable talking about their genitourinary problems with a physician. A 2019 survey found that, of 2,000 men, those who value appearing “tough” regarding their health were more likely to have a higher frequency of health risks.) - a typically 'feminine' trait.
1.2.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Healthcare interventions often do not take into account the positive attributes of masculine identity and therefore can cause more harm \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580856/pdf/nihms363501.pdf)(However, the attributes revealed, such as family provider, responsibility, self-reliance, and perseverance, were viewed as having potential for both negative and positive impacts on health and health-improving behaviors. It will be essential to integrate these prevalent attributes of masculine identity into health promotion interventions such that they facilitate positive behavior change while not competing with gender role norms among this vulnerable group of men.)\).
1.2.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: The majority of users on some of the newer social media platforms, such as [TikTok](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095201/tiktok-users-gender-usa/)(As of March 2021, female users accounted for 61 percent of TikTok's active user accounts in the United States.

This may limit men's ability to share vulnerable posts.
1.2.1.6.3.2. Con: Marketing campaigns for breast cancer awareness could encourage behaviors that increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
1.2.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Many alcohol brands have been known to adorn their products with pink ribbons, promising to donate portions of the proceeds of the sales of these goods, despite the fact that alcohol consumption is one of the risk factors for developing breast cancer \([p. 26](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/92349/powerofpink.pdf)(Many breast cancer organizations have obtained significant benefit from corporate partnerships in cause-related marketing. Certainly, breast cancer awareness is much stronger now than 15 years ago. However, not all products are appropriate for promotion, particularly products that may increase the risk for breast cancer, such as alcohol.)\).
1.2.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Airlines frequently [participate](https://simpleflying.com/qantas-qatar-breast-cancer-awareness/) in Breast Cancer Awareness Month; yet, [frequent flying](https://www.vox.com/2015/9/4/9261579/airplane-radiation-health) is one of the major risk factors for developing breast cancer.
1.2.1.6.3.2.2.1.

1.2.1.6.3.2.3. Con: Despite being somewhat hypocritical, it is better for companies with goods or services that increase the risk of developing breast cancer to create campaigns to raise some awareness and potentially save some lives from the disease than do nothing at all.
1.2.1.6.3.3. Pro: It is easier to develop empathy and awareness for breast cancer, as the breast is an external organ, whereas the ovaries and prostate are internal organs and inherently "invisible" \([p. 27](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/92349/powerofpink.pdf)(Women may identify with others who have suffered from breast cancer because the breast is an external organ. The ovaries and uterus are internal organs that may engender less personal identification. In her essay “Pink Ribbons and Public Private Parts: On Not Imagining Ovarian Cancer,” Holmes suggested that there has been an uneven development of visual culture regarding breast and ovarian cancer because people are less able to visualize and thus identify with internal organs.)\).
1.2.1.6.3.4. Pro: The finite resources available to various cancer campaigns are typically consumed by the [first mover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firstmover.asp). As Breast Cancer Awareness Month began in [1985](https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/03/enough-pink-lets-do-breast-cancer-awareness-month-right/)(Breast cancer is a unique case study in disease branding. Breast Cancer Awareness Month \(BCAM\), launched in 1985 by the American Cancer Society and Imperial Chemical Industries \(now part of AstraZeneca, which makes several breast cancer drugs\), was originally intended to encourage women to get regular mammograms. The momentum around breast cancer awareness continued in the early 1990s, when Evelyn Lauder \(of Estée Lauder\) established the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and solidified the pink ribbon as a universal symbol for the disease. The rest, as they say, is \(very pink, very sparkly\) history.), and [Movember](https://www.uicc.org/news/movember-movement-changing-face-mens-health) in 2003, it makes sense that the former is more successful.
1.2.1.6.4. Con: Breast cancer is not exclusive to cisgender women.

1.2.1.6.4.2. Pro: Breast cancer affects [men](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-cancer-in-men/).
1.2.1.6.4.3. Con: The risk of a man developing breast cancer in the UK is nearly [negligible](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk#heading-One).
1.2.1.6.4.4. Con: With fewer ducts and lobules in the male breast for cancer cells to metastasize, men [comprise](https://www.cancercenter.com/community/blog/2019/07/whats-the-difference-female-male-breast-cancer) just 1% of breast cancer cases.
1.2.2. Con: Feminism undermines the value of [meritocracy](https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/10/meritocracy/)(In a meritocracy, everyone has the right to express their opinions and are encouraged to share them openly and often. Those opinions are listened to and decisions are then made based on those that are deemed the best. It’s important to understand that a meritocracy is not a democracy. There is no “decision by consensus”; not everyone has a vote. This is the key distinction of the meritocracy. While everyone does have a voice, some are listened to more than others.), which is an important aspect of equality that is universally accessible. Through this subversion, feminism makes the world worse.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Some](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/33157)(On the surface, quotas are an explicitly feminist policy; they seek to correct the overrepresentation of men in politics and advance the political and symbolic representation of women. However, quotas are a policy of assimilation into problematic political structures and are predicated upon sex-difference between men and women.\n\nFrom a liberal feminist perspective, this path towards equality of representation would be beneficial.) feminists advocate for [positive discrimination](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/guides/positive-action-or-positive-discrimination-whats-difference); those policies may be [ineffective](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/07/01/gender-quotas-towards-an-improved-democracy/)(Unfortunately, parties are keen to exploit loopholes in a quota regulation when possible, which may account for the failure of quotas in certain cases. For example, the first post-quota national elections in France in 2002 caused a lot of disappointment as women only received 12% of the seats of the French National Assembly, even though the French policy required the nomination of equal proportion of men and women. This was due to the lack of enforcement of the policy: on the national level, only financial penalties applied to non-compliant parties, and many of them chose to pay the fine rather than comply with the quota \(Kittilson, 2005\).) and defeat the point of having a movement for equality.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Quotas that tackle women's under-representation in government are vital for ensuring effective and inclusive law-making.

There are millions of dollars in venture capital heavily invested in precisely this model of together-alone women’s “empowerment.”\n\nYou see this acutely in the girl boss imperative to talk about money.

1.2.3.2.4. Con: The amount of help provided by feminist movements can only be subjectively evaluated; [some would argue](https://www.thelily.com/black-women-share-what-bell-hooks-taught-them-about-feminism/?) that Black women have been helped by feminism, and not actively harmed.

1.2.4.1.4.

When feminism celebrates alternative forms of the good life - career based or otherwise - these women may feel as if they have more support.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Part of the decrease in women's happiness may stem from feminists [shaming](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/27/tradwives-new-trend-submissive-women-dark-heart-history) traditional women.

However, they are inseparable from the profound crisis of both work and care under neoliberal capitalism.\n\nWe live in a time when normative gender roles and dominant notions of sexuality have not only been challenged but are in flux.

1.2.4.3. Con: Correlation is not causation; there is no reason to believe that the rise in feminist activity caused a decrease in women's happiness.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Women are often stressed about balancing family and career, as men do not share equally in [household responsibilities](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). It is not choice that causes women stress, but patriarchy.
1.2.4.3.2.

This increase in honesty makes it more possible to craft useful social policy, as there is more information on women's true preferences and needs.
1.2.4.3.3. Con: Women now have to choose between having a family, their career, or balancing both - which can be [challenging](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/14/perfect-girls-five-women-stories-mental-health) to manage.

1.2.5.1.2.3.

Nine months into the case, Nifong dropped the rape charge and offered Mangum the chance to abandon the entire case. But she refused his offer. She said she wanted justice. Eventually, to defend himself in front of the state bar, Nifong had to recuse himself from the case, and he handed it over to Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general who four months later dropped the remaining charges against the players, declared them “innocent,” and called Nifong a “rogue prosecutor.”) the case, likely because he was [up for re-election](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/duke-lacrosse-rape-espn-30-for-30_n_56e07e33e4b065e2e3d486f7)(Nifong was running for election as the DA when the case landed on his desk.

In this scheme, intimacy is implicitly thought to guarantee symmetry of power. Injuries arise through violation of the private sphere, not within, by and because of it” \(1989, 190\). According to MacKinnon, the liberal public/private paradigm offers no recourse to women for whom the private sphere is not a haven of freedom, but is instead a space wherein they are beaten, raped, and oppressed. Thus, the feminist response must be to explode this erroneous binary and demand public \(state\) responses to what was previously deemed private \(and therefore unpunishable\) violence.)\).

Consistent with stress research, our quantitative analyses indicate that harassment is a stressor that has a positive\nand linear relationship with depressive affect for both men and women, even after controlling for past depressive symptoms, harassment experiences, and other workplace stressors. Importantly, we also find evidence that harassment early in the career has long-term effects on depressive symptoms in adulthood, in part because of stress proliferation. Our interviews suggest that harassed workers feel annoyed, angry, and conflicted, often leading to self-blame and self-doubt.)\). Feminists need to act quickly to break this generational cycle which legal systems facilitate.
1.2.5.4.1.2.

About half the men surveyed, for example, said they felt stressed, depressed or ashamed to face their families. Perhaps harassing women is a way to assert their power, suggests Barker.). As feminism aims to reduce the former and not the latter, the problem will remain - albeit with a different victim profile.
1.2.5.4.1.4. Con: Social attitudes that contribute to harm against women often come from normalised violence within society at large \([p. 3](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/norms.pdf)(Cultural and social norms are highly influential in shaping individual behaviour, including the use of violence. Norms can protect against violence, but they can also support and encourage the use of it. For instance, cultural acceptance of violence, either as a normal method of resolving conflict or as a usual part of rearing a child, is a risk factor for all types of interpersonal violence \(1\). It may also help explain why countries experiencing high levels of one type of violence also experience increased levels of other types \(2\). Social tolerance of violent behaviour is likely learned in childhood, through the use of corporal punishment \(2\) or witnessing violence in the family \(3,4\), in the media \(5\) or in other settings.)\). By focusing solely on women, feminists do not tackle the source of the issue, so it may continue.

This argument has implications not just for immigrant women but for all women because it calls for a rethinking of the basis of feminist formulations and activism.)\).
1.2.5.4.3. Pro: Feminists may lean into [tough on crime](https://thecrimereport.org/2020/11/05/is-metoo-a-driver-of-mass-incarceration/)(It wasn’t until the 80s and 90s that the concept of feminism became a carceral idea. For the first time, the underpolicing of men who were accused of sexual assault was thought to be a major problem regarding gender-reform issues, which in turn led to the incarceration of men being the forefront of the feminist issue.\n\n“By the close of the millennium, the stalwart suit-wearing prosecutor who throws the book at rapists had replaced the bra-burner as the symbol of women’s empowerment,” Gruber said.) narratives in order to ensure that sexual assault is taken seriously; this intersects with [racist narratives of criminality](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/2021/10/04/data-black-men-more-victimized/5903233001/) to [devastating effect](https://mtinnocenceproject.org/innocent-black-people-significantly-more-likely-to-be-wrongfully-convicted-of-sexual-assault/).

From today, they will.) and [require action](https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/publications/cjm/article/theory-and-politics-criminalisation)(In each of these cases a concept of criminalisation is employed to draw attention to the way in which ‘new criminals’ can be ‘created’ through police targeting and criminal justice law reform. In the throes of a government that has legislated in this area more in the past decade than in the whole of the previous century, the idea of criminalisation has begun to take a firmer hold in some sections of the popular, media, and political imagination. Of note have been attempts to ‘criminalise conduct’ through hate crime and anti-social behaviour legislation.).

Pro: Stereotypes regarding blondes, intelligence, and sexual promiscuity originated around [250 years ago](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dumb-blonde-stereotype)(Historians roundly agree that the notion of blondes being dumb dates back to a play performed some 250 years ago, titled Les Curiosités de la Foire, based on the misdemeanours of the legendary courtesan Rosalie Duthé, which established blondes as both stupid and sexually available. Duthé took long pauses before she spoke, leading people to believe she was literally dumb, as well as stupid. Fast-forward to 1953, and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes hit the box office with Marilyn Monroe as Lorelei, epitomised as the dumb blonde. Portrayed as absentminded, slightly scatty and interested in marrying solely for money, some of Lorelei's most famous lines only emphasise the stereotype: "I can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it."

1.3.1.1.1.1.2.

To test this hypothesis Gray et al. presented participants with images of individuals and varied the amount of flesh shown in the pictures \(the amount of “body focus”\). In line with their hypothesis, seeing full bodies, as compared to just faces, caused ratings of agency to diminish but ratings of experience to increase. The same was true when naked bodies were compared with clothed bodies. Indeed, as the sexual suggestiveness of the images increased, perceptions of agency decreased and perceptions of experience increased accordingly.) them as emotional beings instead of agential ones.

Many professional male models use chemical enhancements, such as steroids and creatine, to gain their bulk, which is simply unachievable by putting in hours at the gym between work assignments. Most men who take steroids are unaware of the health risks, and many take them without first getting medical advice or supervision. In the short term, their use can lead to acne, mood swings, paranoia and depression. The longer you use such drugs, the greater the risk of liver failure or heart attacks.

1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: Many [popular video games](https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-games/74) focus on historical conquests, sieges, and warfare; it would be an inaccuracy to predominantly feature women in these types of games.
1.3.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The [top five](https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-games/5) most popular video games of all time were fantasy-style games. These could have easily featured a woman as the main character as historic accuracy was not a factor in their creation; yet, only one did so.

1.3.1.2.1.3.

Male and female belief in real-life female competence was jeopardized after exposure to objectified content of women within video games. Results demonstrated that female characters within video games are unevenly represented compared with male characters, with female characters mostly shown as subordinate to the male hero of the game, objectified, and hypersexualized with disproportionate body parts. The review also uncovered the propensity for men exposed to objectified and sexualized female characters within video games to hold sexist attitudes toward women in a real-life setting, and being more lenient to accept cultural rape myths.) for women's self-esteem, and men's perception of them.

Often enough, characters like Marcus Fenix of Gears of War and War of Darksiders can be described as “bulky”. These are mountains of men that, much like Superman or Frank Miller’s vision of the Batman, demonstrate that the masculine is all about strength, ridiculous levels of strength. Both of the aforementioned characters go well beyond even the most steroid-infused fantasies of bodybuilding success.

1.3.1.3.

1.3.1.5. Con: Even brands whose primary customer base is women, like [Victoria's Secret](https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-commercials-history-photos-2018-5), sexualize women in their advertising. Given this, such representation may not be seen as degrading but rather laudable.

1.3.2.1. Pro: The inferiority of femininity is apparent in the widespread use of misogynistic language, normalising the degradation of women.

Virtual learning platforms have enabled artists and others to share their knowledge.\n\nAfter being confined to their homes for prolonged periods, people started seeking new ways to engage themselves. Many began to look for ways to fulfill their artistic desires that may have been put on hold for the sake of conventional jobs.

1.3.5.2. Pro: Men and women are equally able to stay home and raise children, demonstrating more fluid gender roles and a decreased need for feminist influence.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Society [looks down on](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a28635150/why-we-need-to-stop-pressuring-women-over-30-to-have-children/) women who are not married with children by the age of 30, whereas men are often able to wait and [marry](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/a-profile-of-single-americans/)(These age differences bely huge differences by gender.

1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: When parenting, fathers are often [applauded](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/comedian-makes-hilarious-observation-about-the-way-we-praise-dads_us_57a1fa40e4b08a8e8b602917) for doing the bare minimum, whereas mothers are penalised for minor infractions.
1.3.5.2.1.2. Con: As women hit [menopause](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025712515000218?via%3Dihub) at around 50 years of age, it is natural that women experience pressure to settle down and have a family.
1.3.5.2.1.3. Con: With increasing maternal age, [chromosomal abnormalities](https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/pregnancy-over-age-30)(The risk of chromosomal abnormality increases with maternal age. The chance of having a child affected by Down syndrome increases from about 1 in 1,250 for a woman who conceives at age 25, to about 1 in 100 for a woman who conceives at age 40. It is possible that risks may be higher as many statistics only report live births and do not take into account pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities that were terminated or ended due to natural pregnancy loss.) increase. It is not recommended for women to wait to have a child. This increases the pressure to have a child when young.
1.3.5.2.2. Pro: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, men were [increasingly](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/stay-at-home-dads-were-on-the-rise-pre-pandemic-will-covid-accelerate-the-trend.html) likely to stay home and take care of their children.

1.3.5.2.4. Con: Women's career progression is [stunted](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty) because women do a greater share of parenting and household duties due to gender stereotypes.
1.3.5.2.4.1. Con: Couples or families make the decision to have a child; physiology only determines who carries it.
1.3.5.2.4.2. Con: Gendered divisions in parenting duties are in large part due to biological differences and preferences.
1.3.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: Male chimpanzees are barely involved in parental care \([p. 6868](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC22663/)(In chimpanzees, spider monkeys, and orangutans, paternal care is rare or neglible,)\).
1.3.5.2.4.2.2. Con: Modern societies have developed to a level of sophistication that is able to override historical biological and physiological traits for the good of societal functioning and liberalism.

1.3.5.2.4.4. Pro: Women often [struggle](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2019/03/28/467488/child-care-crisis-keeping-women-workforce/) to find adequate childcare which can make them less reliable employees.

It explores how Finnish women’s career aspirations are strongly affected by motherhood ideals, through collisions with organisational and social pressures. In practice, this dynamic means simultaneous, and often unattainable, dedication to work and care.) limits the number of women who reach the top echelons of business and society.
1.3.5.3. Con: Dress codes reinforce men wearing feminine clothing as being seen as [deviant or weak](https://www.racked.com/2018/4/23/17261508/gender-bending-men-dresses)(The advice columnist wrote, “Isn’t it queer that for a boy to want to be a girl, and look like a girl, and dress like a girl is so unusual that it fills his parents with fear that he is abnormal, whereas virtually every girl in the world wishes she were a boy and the majority of them try to look like boys, and act like boys, and dress like boys? The greatest insult you can offer a man is to call him effeminate, but women esteem it a compliment to be told they have a boyish figure and that they have a masculine intellect.”).
1.3.5.3.1.

1.3.5.3.2. Con: Men wearing skirts has become [increasingly normalised](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fashion/article/skirts-for-men-aw21) by new fashion trends; this may help reduce stigma with time.
1.3.5.3.2.1. Pro: Some men deliberately wear high heels and skirts everyday to demonstrate the double standard between dress codes for men and women and that "[clothes have no gender](https://nypost.com/2020/10/19/married-dad-of-3-wears-heels-and-skirts-everyday/)."
1.3.5.3.3. Con: In Europe, some men and boys have opted to [wear skirts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/french-bus-drivers-skirts-dress-code-nantes) in [protest](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jun/22/teenage-boys-wear-skirts-to-school-protest-no-shorts-uniform-policy) against sexist dress codes that forbade them from wearing shorts in extremely hot temperatures. They would not take such action if they supported the equivocation of skirts with weakness.
1.3.5.3.4.

According to Finucane-Terlop, a school official commented on his outfit in the middle of the courtyard during lunch that day. Finucane-Terlop recalls him saying, “Why are you dressed like that?” and “You shouldn’t do that. You’re a boy—dress like it. What if little kids saw you?”) or dangerous.
1.3.5.4. Con: Women's behaviour continues to be held against a standard dictated by gender differentiation - this is seldom fair.
1.3.5.4.1. Pro: If women are outspoken or loud, especially in careers dominated by men, they are ridiculed and called [bossy](https://www.businessinsider.com/sheryl-sandberg-women-ban-bossy-2014-4?r=US&IR=T), [disrespectful](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200807-the-docility-myth-flattening-asian-womens-careers), or [unfeminine](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/advice/a5890/powerful-women-names/).

1.3.5.4.2. Con: Subtle discrimination can often be [battled](https://www.gov.scot/publications/works-reduce-prejudice-discrimination-review-evidence/pages/4/)(Paluck and Green \(2009\) argue that meta-analyses of studies based on the idea of cooperative learning "consistently confirmed a positive impact of cooperation on outcomes such as positive peer relationships and helpfulness" \(355\), though long-term effects are obviously harder to track. Educational efforts to reduce implicit bias include encouraging empathy, perspective taking, and 'imagining counter-stereotypic examples'. Like other prejudice-reduction initiatives, empathy-inducing interventions have most potential to be successful with young children \(Abrams 2010\) but this does not preclude these being used in adolescent or adult education settings.) through exposure to others breaking stereotypes, and being encouraged to engage with them actively. This is likely to reduce any lingering sexism.
1.3.5.4.3. Pro: Women face double-standards for their sexual behaviour \([p. 179](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1088868319891310)(In line with evolutionary theory \(Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Trivers, 1972\) and biosocial theory \(Wood & Eagly, 2002, 2012\), this meta-analysis demonstrated clear evidence for traditional SDS in studies assessing differences in people’s evaluation, or expectation, of men’s and women’s sexual behavior, although the effect was small. People expected behaviors associated with high sexual activity more from men than from women, and behaviors associated with low sexual activity more from women than from men. Similarly, people evaluated highly sexually active men more positively \(or less negatively\) than highly sexually active women, and low sexually active women more positively \(or less negatively\) than low sexually active men.)\).
1.3.5.4.3.1. Pro: A man with many sexual partners is often [unremarked upon](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/slut-female-word-women-being-female)(Men, of course, are immune – absent, really – from the frenzy of concern. For instance, a new study out of the University of Michigan showed that teen girls who "sext" are called sluts while boys who do the same remain free-from judgement. In another example, the American Medical Association breathlessly released a study in 2006 with the headline "Sex and Intoxication More Common Among Women on Spring Break", intended to warn women about their "risky" behavior while on break – but there was nothing about the men the majority of these young women would supposedly be having all this drunken sex with.) or celebrated, while society [ostracises women](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130603142237.htm) for exhibiting the same behaviour \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4256532/pdf/nihms600220.pdf)(Boys and men are thought to receive praise and positive attributions from others for non-marital sexual contacts, while girls and women are believed to be derogated and stigmatized for similar behaviors.)\).
1.3.5.4.3.2. Pro: Women who have casual sex are often considered by their peers to have [low self-esteem](https://theconversation.com/why-do-women-still-get-judged-so-harshly-for-having-casual-sex-160583)(However, people might believe that women don’t want casual sex in the first place. For example, people might assume that women have causal sex only because they’re trying and failing to attract a long-term relationship. In fact, such beliefs do seem to influence the stereotype about women’s self-esteem.\n\nSpecifically, the more that Americans believed that women don’t actually want casual sex, the more these Americans tended to associate women’s casual sex with low self-worth.) despite this being counter to reality; men are not judged in the same manner.
1.3.5.4.3.3. Con: Women may be [more likely](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210610-why-more-women-identify-as-sexually-fluid-than-men) to report sexual fluidity than men because of increased comfort in LGBT+ roles.
1.4. Con: Feminist methods of striving for equality are detrimental to men.
1.4.1. Con: Feminism has [helped](https://mic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men#.ViRN0CwjX) men.
1.4.1.1. Con: The fact that men suffer from a patriarchal system does not mean that they require feminism.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Advocating for women to have equal rights does not automatically save men from potentially being hurt by the patriarchy \([p. 22](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1266&context=uclf)(I outline a variation on cultural feminism I call "relational feminism." This approach offers benefits to all members of society, not just women. Human beings, whether men, women, or children, do not flourish when hyper-masculinity is glorified and traditionally feminine qualities \(such as care, care-taking, and valuing relationships\) are denigrated. Nor do human beings flourish when all males are pressured to adopt hyper-masculine attributes and repress feminine ones, and all females are pressured to adopt traditionally feminine attributes and repress masculine ones. Relational feminism has the potential to improve life for many people, not just women.)\).
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Men often feel that they [can’t express](https://welldoing.org/article/why-do-men-struggle-to-express-their-feelings) themselves without [ridicule](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45908983)(Another pressure is that men who express their love for family or friends are considered feminine and emasculated, according to Phil Chan, a digital artist from California.). The conversations facilitated by feminism improve this to achieve equity.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Feminism can be [considerate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/gender-equal-international-womens-day-men)(In more gender-equal societies men are half as likely to be depressed, less likely to commit suicide, have around a 40% smaller risk of dying a violent death and even suffer less from chronic back pain. Adolescent boys in those countries have fewer psychosomatic complaints and are more likely to use contraceptives. And sex? Contrary to the stereotypes, one study found that men with feminist partners reported greater sexual satisfaction, as did women with partners who supported feminism.) of the ways in which both men and women suffer in society.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: The changes that some feminists have advocated for put men in a position where they are fearful of women in the [workplace](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/29/men-women-workplace-study-harassment-harvard-metoo).
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Since instances of [false rape accusations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684) are incredibly rare, the fear of being accused of sexual misconduct is irrational.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Even when men are charged with sexual assault they do not seem to face severe consequences.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Rapists can still [gain custody](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alabama-abortion-ban-rape-victims-rapists-parental-rights-a8951751.html) over the child in some states.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Pedophiles can [keep](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/child-sex-abuse-priests-church-of-england-inquiry-report-iicsa-b833262.html) working with children.
1.4.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: The [sentence](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/inothernews/punishing-rape-globally/) for rape in some countries is life in prison, castration, or even death.
1.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Many](https://qz.com/1561822/rape-statistics-two-thirds-of-rape-cases-are-never-cleared/) people get [away](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/it-is-horrific-the-queensland-law-allowing-rapists-off-scot-free-20190607-p51vmn.html) with rape as [few](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem) are convicted. This reduces the harm of any possible allegation - false or otherwise.
1.4.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Some [rapists](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/14/marry-your-rapist-laws-in-20-countries-still-allow-perpetrators-to-escape-justice) are able to marry their victims, instead of being charged.
1.4.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: In many places, [marital rape](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvzzv8/men-who-rape-their-wives-can-still-get-away-with-it-in-many-states) is not considered a crime.
1.4.1.2.1.1.2.3. Con: The FBI updated their definition of rape, this could lead to an [increased number of cases](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/11/fbi-2013-crime-report-the-bureau-expands-its-definition-of-rape.html) that would be considered rape and subsequent convictions.
1.4.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: It is widely acknowledged that women are [unlikely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-compassion-chronicles/201711/why-dont-victims-sexual-harassment-come-forward-sooner) to report sexual assault and rape; therefore, statistics are [under-reported](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/sexual-assault-remains-dramatically-underreported) and [under-prosecuted](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48095118).
1.4.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: The trauma of having been raped is not dissimilar to that of [war-induced PTSD](https://psmag.com/social-justice/lifelong-consequences-rape-96056) in soldiers; this likely prevents many women from coming forward with their stories.
1.4.1.2.1.1.4. Con: Rape accusations are only irrational if you're part of the majority group; Black men in the US are [overwhelmingly](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-question-of-race-in-campus-sexual-assault-cases/539361/)(The university was cleared in April, on the grounds that the numbers did not allow OCR to conclude that race was a statistically significant factor in Colgate’s adjudications—in any given year the number of men of any race referred for formal hearings was in the single digits. \(The investigation does not appear to have examined any individual cases or otherwise reach beyond this statistical analysis.\) But the report did bring those statistics to light, a rarity. In the 2013–14 academic year, 4.2 percent of Colgate’s students were black.

That black women were very easy and responded enthusiastically towards any sexual advance that anyone would want to approach them.) of presumed sexual immorality.
1.4.1.2.1.1.5. Con: As the harm caused by false allegations of any kind of crime can be immense, even they are rare, men are right to fear them \([p. 9](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxlaw/the_impact_of_being_wrongly_accused_of_abuse_hoyle_et_al_2016_15_may.pdf)(According to Webster \(2005\) at least 10,000 former residents of care homes had made complaints by the end of 2004, with between 7,000 and 9,000 care workers having had accusations made against them: ‘Most of these care workers have not been charged with any offence, but many ... had their lives blighted by false allegations. And in the last 15 years, as many as a hundred may have been wrongly convicted.’ \(Webster 2005, p.550, and fn. 605\).)\).

1.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Many](https://www.vogue.com/article/liz-plank-interview-for-the-love-of-men)(But For the Love of Men is no man-hating burn book—far from it. Plank also speaks with men, including queer men and men of color, about their lived experiences, their pain, the ways societies across the world encourage them to stifle their emotions, and the prevailing misperception that they are base beings with no inherent desire for intimacy and connection. “When I started talking to men about their own gender,” Plank writes, “it changed my entire outlook on feminism.”) [prominent](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/12/reviews/990912.12greent.html) [feminists](https://www.fatherly.com/news/rip-bell-hooks-two-quotes-for-men-on-masculinitys-harm/) celebrate men and their relationships with them, and have written extensively on masculinity.
1.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: Emma Watson, a well-known feminist, has promoted feminism as a way for men to [open up](https://ew.com/movies/2017/03/01/emma-watson-feminism-quotes/)(At the heart of HeForShe is the notion that to give women the same rights, respect, and opportunities afforded to men would not be detrimental to men; rather, the removal of the sexist social expectations that come with gender inequality would be freeing and beneficial to everyone.\n\n“Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong.”) and be more sensitive and vulnerable, demonstrating that they don't have to be strong all the time.
1.4.1.2.3.

As Jillian Horowitz notes in a recent essay at Digital America, ironic misandry is typically paired with expressions of “overt femininity, bordering on the exaggerated”: Think of the mild-mannered ladies’ book club, the domestic misandrist cross-stitch, or this “misandry makeup tutorial.” The exaggerated femininity works in two directions: On one level, pairing misandry with the trappings of girlish innocence helps puncture the image of feminists as man-hating monsters. But at the same time, lining feminine spaces with images of weaponry is a sly recognition that female solidarity can still pose a powerful threat to the status quo.

This desire to return to the natural order of things and re-exert control is referred to by members as radical traditionalism. In the academic space, this is classified more generally as a component of fundamentalism, in which traditional gender roles are enforced.

This phenomenon of men completing suicide more frequently than females, while females engage significantly more frequently in suicide attempts, is known as the gender paradox of suicidal behaviour \[6, 7\].)\).

1.4.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: In a patriarchal society, men are discouraged from speaking out about being victims of sexual assault because they're told that men either "[can't be raped](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JACPR-06-2017-0303?journalCode=jacpr)" or "should have enjoyed it."

If successful, the Reinforced Hybrid account interprets and combines these elements in a way that does a better job than its rivals of making plausible the claim that, in relatively\nordinary circumstances, to treat another merely as a means is to treat\nhim wrongly. The account re-establishes the credibility of the Mere Means Principle as a moral constraint.)\).
1.4.1.4.2.2. Con: Feminists [can and do](https://www.salon.com/2013/11/02/make_fatherhood_a_mans_choice_partner/) advocate for men's right to choose \(or rather reject\) fatherhood. It is not a central tenet of their activism though as the harms to men are merely monetary.
1.4.1.4.2.2.1.

1.4.1.4.2.3. Con: As child support is often only [state mandated](https://www.salon.com/2013/11/07/no_child_support_cant_be_a_choice/)(While it may not be easy for most men to opt out of paying child support, it is incredibly easy for a non-custodial father to opt out of fatherhood. The burden of actually raising a child usually falls to the mother as the custodial parent. Women who are on welfare generally are required to cooperate in obtaining a child support order, but for women who are not on welfare, seeking a child support order is optional. Custody and visitation are separate from child support, and a non-custodial parent is not required to seek shared custody or to exercise visitation rights. Thus, the whole concept of child support as “forced fatherhood” is silly.) in situations of low income, parents should not be able to opt out in case it harms the child's quality of life.
1.4.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Despite many states establishing laws that protect sperm donors in cases of [AID](https://www.fertilityone2one.co.uk/donor-insemination/), men who have sex that results in pregnancy, regardless of intent, can be coerced into parenthood and therefore child support payments \([p. 28](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2439294)(A child may be born to a woman with a sperm donor, and the genetic donor is not required to become the legal or social father to the child. Most rational minds would not say that these children are necessarily at any severe disadvantage as a result. The needs of the child will be met by the mother alone or by the mother with the help of the state. ... the state is making clear that women can contract away their social and legal claims against their child’s biological father, recognizing that women have the capacity, understanding, and ability to know what is at stake in becoming a mother. The only difference between conception through sperm donation and conception through donation by a father unwilling to parent is the sexual act. It cannot be so that only if a woman chooses a sperm donor may she fully be aware of her decision to become a sole parent. Or, rather, it cannot be that only in the case of sperm donation will the state recognize that a child can be without a father.)\).

1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Feminists do not criticise laws that harm men's right to choose fatherhood in the same way that they advocate for women's right to choose motherhood.
1.4.1.4.3.1.

Nevertheless, by considering two driving forces behind gay male assisted reproduction – social norms favouring biological family formation and the need for family security – I ultimately conclude that a basis for solidarity exists between gay men and reproductive justice movements. That basis is a concept like ‘procreative liberty’.)\).
1.4.1.4.3.2.

1.4.1.4.4. Con: As men may be able to [coerce](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-reproductive-coercion) their partners into bearing more children, feminists advocating for men to have more influence in reproductive decisions is counterintuitive.
1.4.1.4.4.1.

Con: Feminism [helps](https://mic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men#.VootIviQA)(In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to treat women and men differently under the law. The case, Craig v. Boren, was filled by a plaintiff in Oklahoma over its gender-specific drinking age policy, which prohibited men from drinking before age 21, but allowed women to drink when as young as 18. This implied that men are inherently more reckless and women are more responsible. After the law was struck down, the drinking age became 21 for all. \n\nAccording to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the ruling determined much more than just Oklahoma's drinking age.

1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Feminist politicians have fought for [paternal leave](https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/parental-leave-policy-changed-way-sweden-sees-fatherhood), particularly in Scandinavian countries.
1.4.3.3.2.3. Con: As men are often considered the [default](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/unconscious-bias-default-male/1462277) gender in society, there are seldom laws that discriminate against them for their gender. For feminism to prioritise them would be futile.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: Laws are more likely to be unjustly biased against women than men, such that any imbalance that feminists may introduce would be limited in its effect.
1.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: [Many](https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-marriage) women are married or in union before age 18 and can experience a host of negative consequences because of this. They need feminists to fight for them as they are unable to do so themselves.
1.4.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: Feminism in the Philippines likely had some influence over the decision to [raise the age of consent](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-senate-backs-bill-raise-sexual-consent-age-12-16-2021-09-28/) from 12 to 16 \([pp. 11-13](https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/philippinen/14072.pdf)\).

This is the only way to achieve a just world, so if feminism undermines this it should be called out.
1.4.3.3.3.3. Pro: The [legal system](http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-demographics-changing-to.php) and [politics](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-10-24/despite-diverse-demographics-most-politicians-are-still-white-men) in the United States are overwhelmingly dominated by \(white\) men. These systems are and have been biased against women. If feminism counteracts such biases by demanding equality of rights, then this should be welcomed.
1.4.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: One way to advocate for any group, minority or otherwise, is to push for new legislation protecting its constituents' rights, as [feminists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women) have done in the US.
1.4.3.3.3.3.2. Con: The fact that a homogeneous group is in a position of power does not necessarily translate in biased lawmaking for the minority.

1.4.3.3.4.2. Pro: In the US, paternity laws commonly [discriminate](https://dadsdivorce.com/articles/harsh-laws-that-discriminate-against-men-and-fathers/) against men; many such laws are supported by feminist groups such as the [National Organization of Women](https://canadiancrc.com/Newspaper_Articles/Wendy_McElroy_Paternity_Innocence_is_defence_14JUL04.aspx)("in 2002 Davis vetoed the California Paternity Justice Act, \(AB 2240\), which would have extended the challenge period and vacated judgments against falsely named "fathers."

After all, who cares that the clinically and psychologically dead psychopaths are forced to support other people’s children? Men are guilty and should pay, simply because they are men.

1.4.3.3.4.3. Pro: Women's rights groups have fought [against](https://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/) shared parenting legislation.
1.4.3.3.4.4. Con: The discrimination in custody battles is [not brought on](https://queerguesscode.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/the-truth-about-feminism-and-child-custody-discrimination/) by feminism, nor is it necessarily [legally enshrined](https://www.blbsolicitors.co.uk/blog/are-the-family-courts-really-biased-towards-women/)(A 2015 study by the University of Warwick concluded that family courts do not discriminate against the father...\n\n“But there was actually no indication of any bias towards mothers over fathers by the courts; in fact we established there was a similar success rate for mothers and fathers applying for orders to have their children live with them...\n\nIndeed, in 2014 the Government pressed through The Children and Families Act 2014, Section 11 which enshrined in law the desire for “parental involvement”, which ordered courts “to presume, unless the contrary is shown, that involvement of that parent in the life of the child concerned will further the child’s welfare”.), so remediation of this issue is unlikely to occur through direct action.

1.4.3.3.4.5. Con: Feminists argue that women shouldn't be the default carer, as they often are \([p. 4](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/view/?ref=127_127000-awfnqj80me&title=Women-at-the-core-of-the-fight-against-COVID-19-crisis)(Not only do women dominate employment in the care sector, they also provide most unpaid work at home. Across the OECD on average, at just over four hours per day, women systematically spend around 2 hours per day more on unpaid work than men \(OECD Gender Data Portal\). Gender gaps in unpaid work are largest in Japan and Korea \(2.5 hours\) and Turkey \(4 hours per day\), where traditional norms on gender roles prevail. However, even in Denmark, Norway and Sweden – countries that express strong and progressive attitudes towards gender equality – gender gaps in unpaid work still amount to about one hour per day. Gender gaps in unpaid work are often larger in developing and emerging economies \(Section 3.4\).)\). In an equal society, judgements made regarding child custody would be decided by who is best suited for the task, something made easier through feminist action.
1.4.3.4. Con: In comparison to men, women do not experience meaningful social advantages, as even [benevolent sexism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/benevolent-sexism) is still sexism. Pushing for feminists to dismantle spaces of only surface level advantage is a waste of their resources.
1.4.3.4.1.

This allows men to continue to be exploited as the draft remains.
1.4.3.5.5. Con: The [military](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/25/revealed-scale-of-abuse-and-sexual-harassment-of-women-in-uk-military) is often incredibly hostile to women; it would be a dereliction of their duty for feminists to advocate for women to be forced into service, even if it made society ostensibly equal.
1.4.3.5.5.1. Con: It is possible for feminists to advocate for fair and equal treatment in both the military and the draft.
1.4.4. Con: Current forms of feminism do not oppress or come to the detriment of men. Rather, their critiques of men's power and privileges can be alienating, as they target something often taken for granted.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Men are generally not accustomed to pushback from women; therefore, many men mistakenly associate feminism with oppressive actions that diminish their masculinity and livelihoods.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Women who assert themselves are often associated with being aggressive or bossy while men doing the same are seen as confident leaders. This [double standard](https://leanin.org/tips/mvp)(This bias often surfaces in the way women are described, both in passing and in performance reviews. When a woman asserts herself—for example, by speaking in a direct style or promoting her ideas—she is often called “aggressive” and “ambitious.” When a man does the same, he is seen as “confident” and “strong.”\n\nWhen you hear a woman called “bossy” or “shrill,” request a specific example of what the woman did and then ask, “Would you have the same reaction if a man did the same thing?”) often leads men to feel unduly oppressed.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: As recently as the 1960s, women were [prohibited](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/07/living/sixties-women-5-things/index.html) from doing a number of activities that men could; men are likely to be uncomfortable within these situations, as historically they have held all the power.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: Boys who are [disciplined](https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/mother-father-discipline-differences-science/)(In one of the first studies to tackle the topic in 1992, researchers tracked the disciplinary styles of over 100 parents with children in preschool. Based on the self-reported accounts of disciplinary styles moms and dads, results showed that when mothers used more harsh, coercive, and power-assertive forms of discipline, their kids displayed more aggression and were generally less popular with among their peers.) by their mothers in domineering ways often go on to be aggressive with their peers; this lack of an emotional schema to negotiate criticism from women may carry through to adulthood.
1.4.4.1.4. Con: Men and women make [equally good bosses](https://www.apa.org/research/action/boss)(For example, women's typically more mentoring, coaching style is more favorably received in female-dominated professions; men's more typically "command and control" style is well received in male-dominated professions.\n\nThus, all things being equal, men and women are equally effective.) provided they flex their leadership style to match the standard of their profession.
1.4.4.1.5. Con: Though men and women may currently enter debates with [different standards](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/men-and-women-tend-to-argue-about-different-things-in-different-ways/274807/) for engagement, these are likely to be socialised and may shift generationally, leading men to view feminism more positively.
1.4.4.2. Pro: [Third-wave feminism](https://link.medium.com/WToExBObWkb)(Third-wave feminism does, however, introduce the idea that males can be oppressed by females on the basis of gender and conceptualises transgender males as suffering oppression on the axis of gender \(interpreted as personal identity rather than hierarchy\), this privileges females over males and creates a feminist movement that centres and prioritises males; women do not suffer material oppression per se, rather the social category ‘woman’ is subject to oppression the corollary of this is that oppression is something one may identify themselves into or out of.) discusses the ways in which power can be used by all groups to enact oppression, including by women to harm men. This is far more holistic than prior theorisations of power.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Third-wave feminism is often considered to be [toxic](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/18/feminism-rosetta-scientist-shirt-dapper-laughs-julien-blanc-inequality), as it focuses on shaming sexist men rather than engaging with the source of these actions.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Though some people could be considered to be toxic feminists, they do not constitute the majority; some argue that [toxic feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Toxic_femininity) is not a real thing.
1.4.4.2.1.2.

It would be misguided.) it as "[ironic](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/ironic-misandry-why-feminists-joke-about-drinking-male-tears-and-banning-all-men.html)(That reaction is part of the point: “I enjoy that it bothers the men who don’t get it,” one Misandrist Book Club member told me. “It’s a good way to weed out cool dudes from the dumb bros.” As Zimmerman puts it: “The men who get annoyed by misandry jokes are in my experience universally brittle, insecure, humorless weenies with victim complexes,” while the “many intelligent, warm, confident feminist men in my life … mostly get the joke immediately and play along. They’re not worried I actually want to milk them for their tears.”)."
1.4.4.2.1.3. Pro: Many third-wave feminists [cloak](https://www.digitalamerica.org/collecting-male-tears-misandry-and-weaponized-femininity-on-the-internet-jillian-horowitz/)(All of these sites of misandry trade on the bizarre assumption that women who hate men are necessarily unfeminine; thus, the consciously cartoonish expressions of femininity function as both an in-joke and a strategic maneuver. When paired with articulations of ironic violence or earnest rage \(or something in between\), “misandry” is not only emptied of the meaning ascribed to it by men’s rights activists, but simultaneously weaponizes feminist anger and the devalued trappings of femininity. It turns objects coded as feminine into threats.

Because to pretend as though the 22-year-old white female blogger talking about her hatred of men from the comfort of her prepaid dorm at an Ivy League school does not hold many tangible privileges over, say, the undocumented male worker who is cleaning the bathroom stalls of her building at night, is ludicrous. There are countless privileges she has over him, and countless points of access she has in our society that he will never see.) politics.
1.4.4.3. Con: Nearly 30% of men feel that feminist progress towards equality has come at the [detriment to men](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/nearly-30percent-of-men-say-gains-toward-gender-equality-has-come-at-their-expense.html).

1.5. Con: Feminism's propensity to point out sexism where it does not exist eclipses other sociocultural issues.
1.5.1. Con: Society has been structured so as to privilege men over others. Feminism is legitimate in pushing through social reforms on widespread issues resulting from biases that [disproportionately](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/09/23/we-must-bold-confront-economic-inequality-women-column/5850981002/)(Women have been disproportionately hurt by job losses during the pandemic.

These jobs tend to be lower paying and have less flexibility or benefits, exacerbating many inequalities in the workforce.) affect women - these changes benefit many groups.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Justice-based forms of feminism are good for many marginalized groups, as they focus on ways to expose and alter harmful dynamics that are embedded within power structures \([p. 151](https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=fac_pubs)(These social justice feminists focused on labor reform, first\nin seeking reduced working hours and better working conditions\nand later a minimum wage. As discussed above, this agenda\nplaced these feminists squarely at odds with the National Women's Party's advocacy for an Equal Rights Amendment in the 1920s. As McGuire explains, the social justice feminists had turned their efforts to protecting women workers, with an eye toward expanding workplace protections to all employees.")\).
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Justice-based forms of feminism are not particularly common in the current era of [neoliberal](https://theconversation.com/how-neoliberalism-colonised-feminism-and-what-you-can-do-about-it-94856)(The movement for gender equality, then, is increasingly entangled with neoliberalism, which has mobilised feminism to advance political goals and enhance market value. Yet, at the same time, a different form of feminism has also unexpectedly gained popularity....\nI call this neoliberal feminism, since it recognises gender inequality \(differentiating itself from post-feminism, which focuses on individual women’s “empowerment” and “choice”, yet repudiates feminism\) while simultaneously denying that socioeconomic and cultural structures shape our lives.)

Choice feminism, instead, does not really challenge society. It ensures that everyone can be included in feminism \(we wouldn’t want to lose any allies!\). It also guarantees that people cannot be judged since all choices are valid and, therefore, not open to moral indignation. Choice feminism is, thus, increasingly used by women in order to present their empowerment as feminist.) by the latter, as group action and critical social engagement are derided.

On this view the body is not just the thing we can prod and poke, it is shaped by a plethora of perceptions: if we feel bad about it, it becomes a ‘bad thing’; if we feel good about it, it becomes a ‘good thing’. But the way we think about it is not a matter of free choice unless we live in a society which gives space for that freedom.) becomes a salient aspect of political identity to organise around under feminism. This is effective as it targets more people than class or race would.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Womanhood is not a monolith, nor is it treated as such by feminists. This limits the persuasiveness of identity as a rallying element.

Pro: Feminism has brought hundreds of thousands of women from all demographics and walks of life [together](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088114_2087975_2087967,00.html) in [protests](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088114_2087975_2087970,00.html) and [marches](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088114_2087975_2087969,00.html), united by a common goal.
1.5.1.2.3. Con: Many feminist protests and marches lack a coherent cause or goal, as there are many different perspectives on womanhood and equality.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: [Protests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/30/pro-choice-supporters-hold-biggest-ever-protest-against-polish-government) often have [clear goals](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/29/argentina-senate-to-debate-a-bill-that-could-legalise-abortion)(“The feminist movement has worked with all political parties for all the laws that have to do with women’s rights,” Alanis told Al Jazeera. “We deserve to have a law that accompanies women at the hour of deciding to terminate a pregnancy.”) as, by nature, they react to [social issues](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/miss-world-protest-1970-womens-liberation-feminists-b1759081.html).

1.5.1.3. Con: Feminism has been claimed by groups that have incompatible methods and goals, hindering social reform.
1.5.1.3.1.

Radical feminism views patriarchy as dividing societal rights, privileges, and power primarily along the lines of sex, and as a result, oppressing women and privileging men.\n\nRadical feminism opposes existing political and social organization in general because it is inherently tied to patriarchy.

It leverages legal systems in order to achieve equality, leaving the structure, its integration in society, and core aspects of social control remaining.
1.5.1.3.4. Con: Social reform comes from fostering [open dialogue](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/social-sciences/what-is-social-change)(When we listen respectfully to others who have different opinions and life experiences than our own, we take the first step in listening; we accept that there are myriad perspectives and points of view on most issues of concern. If we truly want to be a participant in real change, we cannot stop at acceptance, but we must have conversations that push and pull, that asks us to give and take. And if we are willing to do that, we can find those points of agreement and come together on them. We needn't concede those points that define our values but find ways to work together towards positive change that reflects our shared values. It is the art of principled compromise that has the power to create a more lasting change.) and giving people the tools to think critically about society; feminism could never make change if it was dogmatic and offered only one view.
1.5.1.3.4.1. Pro: People are often [driven](https://fs.blog/facts-are-not-enough/)(When we’re faced with a choice between being correct or being accepted, more often than not we choose the latter. Think of the last time you were with friends for dinner and someone said something that you not only disagreed with but was also factually incorrect. Did you correct them? Or did you sit there quietly, keeping your knowledge to yourself because you didn’t want to confront the person? It’s dangerous to argue in a group setting.) by social acceptance and seek to align their beliefs as such. If feminists are dogmatic then they may alienate allies and make themselves unpersuasive.
1.5.1.3.4.2. Con: By allowing the movement to be aligned with many divergent political stances, feminism has facilitated its co-option by forces that seek to [undermine](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/feminism-capitalist-handmaiden-neoliberal)(I fear that the movement for women's liberation has become entangled in a dangerous liaison with neoliberal efforts to build a free-market society. That would explain how it came to pass that feminist ideas that once formed part of a radical worldview are increasingly expressed in individualist terms. Where feminists once criticised a society that promoted careerism, they now advise women to "lean in". A movement that once prioritised social solidarity now celebrates female entrepreneurs. A perspective that once valorised "care" and interdependence now encourages individual advancement and meritocracy.\n\nWhat lies behind this shift is a sea-change in the character of capitalism. The state-managed capitalism of the postwar era has given way to a new form of capitalism – "disorganised", globalising, neoliberal. Second-wave feminism emerged as a critique of the first but has become the handmaiden of the second.) its overall goal.
1.5.1.3.5.

If bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency think we should control pollutants with a market-based permit system, even a very liberal Congress should let them try it out. If a new police chief wants to try body cameras to improve community relations, even a skeptical mayor should give them a free hand. Why is this? First, people are always more motivated to implement change that they “believe in.” Second, people are more easily persuaded that they are wrong when actually given the chance to try out their ideas and see them fail first-hand.), feminists may be able to persuade more people of their legitimacy.
1.5.1.3.5.1. Pro: Encouraging dialogue with the aim of perfect consensus hinders action and causes a loss of morale; this has been [weaponised](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/are-you-sabotaging-your-own-company)(During World War II, the predecessor to the US Central Intelligence Agency produced a secret field manual detailing how “citizen-saboteurs” could disrupt the operations of enemy organizations...\n“Advocate ‘caution.’ Be ‘reasonable’ and urge your fellow-conferees to be ‘reasonable’ and avoid haste, which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.”\n“Be worried about the propriety of every decision.

1.5.1.3.5.2. Con: Feminists should not encourage divergence as contradictions often [undermine](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism)(The problem today is that, across a number of crucial areas of public life, the basic intuitions of populists have been repeatedly verified. One of the main contributors to this has been the spread of digital technology, creating vast data trails with the latent potential to contradict public statements, and even undermine entire public institutions. Whereas it is impossible to conclusively prove that a politician is morally innocent or that a news report is undistorted, it is far easier to demonstrate the opposite. Scandals, leaks, whistleblowing and revelations of fraud all serve to confirm our worst suspicions. While trust relies on a leap of faith, distrust is supported by ever-mounting piles of evidence. And in Britain, this pile has been expanding much faster than many of us have been prepared to admit.) trust, particularly when scandals arise. Such strategies harm feminism in the long term.

In January, when PerryUndem asked whether “most women interpret innocent remarks as being sexist,” Republican women were 11 points more likely than Democratic men to say yes. When PerryUndem asked the question again this month, the gap had more than doubled to 23 points. A year ago, Democratic men were 30 points more likely than Republican women to strongly agree that “the country would be better off if we had more women in political office.” The gap is now 45 points.) and muddies the water around critical cultural issues, it is less capable of making material change than other movements.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Public interest in changing patriarchal structures is limited, as the issue does not have the same appeal as other social dilemmas.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: People are not offended by the knowledge that they are more wealthy and better fed than others. Instead, they react negatively when they are framed as responsible for the issue \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641360/pdf/fpsyg-08-01770.pdf)(Thus, it is important to understand how people perceive injustices, how they react to them, how they give meaning to them, and also how they try to cope with them. The just-world theory \(e.g., Lerner, 1977, 1980\) emphasizes the adaptive function of the beliefs in a just world \(BJW\) to cope with injustices and inequalities. Usually, this contains aspects of believing that the world is a generally just place or that it is at least just for oneself or for others. Such coping or meaning-making mechanisms \(among others\) include cognitive re-evaluations of unjust events and justice-repairing through own just reactions, as well as negative and anti-social tendencies, norm-breaking behavior, and victim-blaming \(e.g., Dalbert, 2009; Hafer and Sutton, 2016\); the latter is especially relevant regarding persons with a strong general BJW.)\).

I can see the defensive hackles rising the moment the F word \(not that one, feminism\) is even mentioned in passing. There is a barrier of denial and often attempts to tell you, the woman, the person who is experiencing sexism, that you've got it wrong.). This limits the capacity of feminism to make change.

1.5.2.1.4.1. Con: Women benefit from feminism, even when they don't support it. For example, at one stage, [90% of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_Opposed_to_Woman_Suffrage#/media/File:Household_Hints.jpg) opposed women's suffrage, though it now enables more choice in democratic society.

This alienates them from the movement as they don't wish to face those negative associations.
1.5.2.1.4.3. Pro: [Polls](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8372417/feminist-gender-equality-poll) in the US suggest that as few as 18% of women call themselves feminists. This is despite more than two-thirds of women in the country supporting equality of the sexes.

As such, a high degree of polarisation can lead to irreconcilable positions, making it difficult to reach agreements.) caused by the movement is likely to be minimal.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Feminism's history does not justify its evolution into a modern [divisive force](https://time.com/3028827/women-against-feminism-gets-it-right/). There is no reason to believe that the positive actions of the past will be replicated in the future.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: There is an international network of feminist [activism](http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2019/3/compilation-womens-activism-thats-changed-the-world) used to combat injustice. This can be used to share best practices and methods of persuading people.

As if the unusually light sentence wasn't concerning enough, he was then released three months early, in September 2016, for 'good behaviour'.) despite the overwhelming amount of evidence against them.
1.5.2.4.1.3. Con: Often people push for removing those accused of sexual misconduct from their workplace, yet this flies in the face of HR [best practices](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-address-an-employee-sexual-harassment-complaint-1916862).
1.5.2.4.1.4.

Given this, the two may be wholly disconnected.
1.5.2.4.4.4. Pro: Victim-blaming directs the responsibility to [change behaviour](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45809169)(The Metropolitan Police arrested a man and later released him under investigation.

1.5.2.4.4.5.

Given this, feminists overwhelmingly call attention to serious real world oppressions to maintain some social respect.
1.5.3.1. Pro: In many cases where feminists identify sexism, it is often [very difficult](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/05/yesallwomen-in-the-wake-of-elliot-rodger-why-its-so-hard-for-men-to-recognize-misogyny.html) for anyone unaccustomed to perceiving these issues to notice.

Or the idea we have about boys and girls “natural” capabilities and in the workplace, where men tend to be promoted more on potential and women more on performance.

People increasingly demand help from others, and advertise their oppression as evidence that they deserve respect and assistance.

1.5.3.4.1. Con: While some may exaggerate victimisation for their own gain, such safety is less likely to exist outside of very considerate social justice movements. This makes it more likely that complaints of sexism - as directed by feminists to the outer world - are legitimate.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: Calls to victimhood have become mechanisms for the subversion of power by hegemonic groups, disrupting activisms that previously undermined them \([p. 4](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107926/1/Introduction_to_special_issue._The_logic_of_victimhood.pdf)(One key feature of this contemporary public discourse is the reversal of victimhood claims, so that those who speak out on the injustices they have suffered are now accused as oppressors by those in positions of power \(Cole, 2007\). Even though the link between claims to suffering and positions of power can never be completely fixed, we argue that victimhood today operates as a ‘master’ signifier, a dominant communicative logic that relies on auxillary vocabularies – of injured white masculinity, celebrated survivorship or heroic sacrifice – to reclaim power for the powerful and retrench existing hegemonic arrangements in liberal polities. Whether it is authoritarian populists, networked misogynists or imperialist state actors, this logic of weaponized victimhood is, we contend, a crucial site of political struggle and, as such, a scholarly terrain of urgent interrogation.)\).
1.5.4. Pro: As feminism discriminates between groups it attempts to help, it must draw attention to sexism continually to justify its existence. Other groups do not have this issue.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Women's position in society has improved such that feminism is no longer a useful tool for analysing oppression. Feminists therefore take vital airtime from other activists.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: People mostly believe that men and women are equally capable and [support progress](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/22/how-people-around-the-world-view-gender-equality-in-their-countries/) for gender equality. Feminist activism therefore has little left to do.

For example, many medical professionals in the US believe that black patients are less susceptible to pain, and less likely to comply with medical advice than white patients. The quick-fire judgements of police officers are also very fraught; some research suggests that US police instinctively see darker faces as being more criminal. There are also lots of examples of unconscious bias at the recruitment stage. Hiring managers may gravitate to candidates who are similar to them, assume that male candidates are more competent, or see a ‘black-sounding’ name on an application, and instinctively associate that person with aggression.) often shapes perceptions in ways that people find difficult to deconstruct.

And, like women, men with a bachelor’s degree or higher are more likely than those with less education to say the term describes them at least somewhat well \(46% vs. 37%\).) of men in the US identify as feminists. This is likely to limit alignment with feminist policies, even if they generally support gender parity.

The cause is the consequence; you are rich because you are white, you are white because you are rich.” We might also add that you are a man because you have money, and you have money because you are a man. It is in this context of unequal access to productive, remunerative labor that consumerism and commodification have become so pervasive to the public personas of black masculinity. From slavery on, the fact of blackness being the cause and consequence of economic devaluation has made patriarchal capitalist inclusion especially appealing for black men, like winning a rigged game against all odds. But in doing so, the terms of black liberation are collapsed into patriarchal entitlement and participation in capitalism, rather than being framed as a more ambitious anti-capitalist critique.), like misogyny, is frequently used to justify wealth based inequality. Without antagonism of these structures they are likely to persist.
1.5.4.2.3.1.

Research of the kind discussed in this brief can help better identify the policies and practices needed not only to ensure that workers of color can contribute fully to their own and to the country’s economic success, but also to provide these workers with the dignity and fairness that should attend every job.)\). Only by challenging and campaigning for change can meaningful progress be made.
1.5.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.

An alternative view expands on this last-mentioned option: People should be treated as equals, should treat one another as equals, should relate as equals, or enjoy an equality of social status of some sort.) approach may be more useful than a feminist one, as it does not immediately discern between the groups it attempts to help. This approach ensures that incendiary stances are less viable, as there is an emphasis on coalition building.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Mainstream forms of feminism emphasise identity, taking attention away from structural [economic decline](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/11/24/woke-identity-politics-progressive-economic-bernie-sanders-column/6386871002/)(Occupy Chicago, possibly the largest gathering of Guy Fawkes-mask wearing radicals outside Manhattan’s Zucotti Park, fell apart largely because of the endless bifurcation of members’ agendas. Whenever a task force of leading members was proposed to discuss some almost-consensus working-class issue like support for an increased minimum wage, the call would immediately come for a women’s task force. Then, what about a Black women’s task force? A Black gay women’s task force?). This limits social and financial progress.
1.5.4.3.1.1. Con: Feminism has restructured systems of capital, in order to give women more [financial autonomy](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/11/women-rights-money-timeline-history). This demonstrates its power to affect economic systems.
1.5.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Up until relatively recently, [inheritance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118430873.est0290)(Primogeniture is an inheritance rule that assigns the entire family estate to the first son. In Europe primogeniture emerged in the thirteenth century and kept spreading up to the eighteenth century. It was most common among the feudal nobility and whenever land represented the primary source of wealth. It predominated in England, Scandinavia, and parts of France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Outside Europe, it was adopted in Japan and the southern American colonies, while partition prevailed in sub-Saharan Africa and Islamic regions. The French revolution abolished primogeniture and during the nineteenth century most European countries followed suit.) in Europe was passed to the eldest male heir under a system known as primogeniture. Feminists are pushing to entrench this change \([p. 1](https://www.serlecourt.co.uk/images/uploads/news-and-events/First_come%2C_first_served_Women_and_primogeniture_in_the_21st_century.pdf)\).

For example, among senior roles in venture capital \(VC\) firms, only 4.9% of the partners are female. The picture doesn't get much rosier when it comes to private equity \(PE\), in which fewer than 10% of senior roles are held by women.) in most countries.
1.5.4.3.1.2. Con: Gender roles [contribute](https://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/how-gender-norms-impact-boys-and-girls) to inequality and [reduce](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/03/22/2003642142) women's earnings throughout their lifetimes; focusing on inequality instead of the root cause makes no difference.
1.5.4.3.1.2.1. Con: By discussing [precarious work](https://www.workrightscentre.org/what-is-precarious-work) in terms of gender and [wage gaps](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11293-020-09677-z)(The overall gender wage gap is larger than either the full-time pay gap or the part-time pay gap, even after controlling for detailed personal and job characteristics. This result is a consequence of two findings: \(i\) part-time wages are lower than full-time wages, and \(ii\) the majority of part-time workers are women. In aggregation, this brings down the average female wage, leading to a larger aggregate gender wage gap. This was further linked to a differential selection by gender into full-time and part-time work, with women of higher earnings potential being overrepresented in the pool of part-time workers, resulting in no gender pay gap in the part-time worker category. Policies targeted at encouraging full-time employment for women should therefore reduce the gender wage gap.), feminists may lead people away from overall system reform.
1.5.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Due to historic discrimination, women are more likely to work precarious jobs than men \([p. 5](https://eige.europa.eu/resources/ti_pubpdf_mh0217250enn_pdfweb_20170503163908.pdf)(EIGE’s research confirmed that throughout their course of life women are more likely to work fewer hours, in low-paid and insecure jobs. People with a non-EU migrant background are more often engaged in precarious work compared to those born in the EU. However, women living in their country of birth work in precarious jobs more often than men, including men born outside of the EU.)\). This is an important aspect of economic inequality that feminism can target.
1.5.4.3.1.2.3. Pro: Even when in similar roles, women are more likely to suffer from job insecurity than men \([p. 1](https://www.readcube.com/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.526162)(Results show that women perceive greater insecurity under precarious working conditions \(temporary work, informal work, salary cuts, tenure\), whereas in the case of men variables related to their professional careers \(job category, education\) and household incomes were relevant predictors. It is concluded that job insecurity affects both gender groups, but the conditions in which this perception grows are significantly impacted by gender inequality.)\). Feminist thinking is a useful method to remain cognisant of this difference.
1.5.4.3.1.3. Pro: Companies can drive social change yet often only act when their [bottom line is harmed](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/how_businesses_can_take_the_lead_in_combatting_gender_based_violence)(Meanwhile, sexual harassment claims frequently mar companies’ brands and reputations \(and bottom lines\). Allegations of sexual harassment by senior staff and drivers at the ride-sharing company Uber, resulted in 56% of survey respondents refusing to use their services.. In another example, allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by construction workers on a major Ugandan infrastructure project resulted in the World Bank cancelling $265 million of funding and issuing a public statement. In fact, research has shown that sexual harassment claims have a greater effect on a company’s reputation than other forms of misconduct like fraud.). While feminists can change social norms, this does not stop economic systems from prioritising profit over people; as such, feminism is not as useful as other alternatives.
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: Though it lacks an activist past, egalitarianism is embedded in history. This may make it more effective at inspiring change, as it both lacks the [negative associations](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/psychologylse/2021/03/05/whats-wrong-with-the-feminist-label/) of feminism and has been accepted in many places.
1.5.4.3.2.1. Con: Despite an ostensibly [egalitarian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33126723) bill of rights, in the UK, only [58%](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/overview/thevote/) of the male population, and no women, could vote prior to 1918. Egalitarian ideals can often be cosmetic and ineffective.
1.5.4.3.2.2.

Panken Professor of Liturgy and Midrash, is that in his choice of language, scribe Farissol uniquely addressed the high-status Hebrew-literate female owners of these prayer books and applied and adapted the liturgy to their needs.\n\nThrough these prayer books and other texts of the era, we encounter other surprisingly egalitarian roles filled by women: female scribes, a poetess who translated liturgy from Hebrew to Italian, and the owners of Farissol’s works, who praised God for being made women, and not men.), often have egalitarian interpretations; these could be co-opted by egalitarians to encourage change, even in a secular society.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: [Egalitarianism](https://www.genderscilab.org/blog/gender-equality-does-not-equal-gender-neutrality)(Taking implicit attitudes into account is important because even if we hold egalitarian beliefs, we may still have sexist implicit associations that may influence our behavior.15 As an example of how implicit bias likely matters for women in STEM, consider the finding that faculty in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics at six highly-ranked research-intensive universities in the United States rated a male applicant for a lab manager position as more competent and hirable than a woman with an identical CV, proposed a higher starting salary for him, and offered him more mentoring.13 This hiring scenario highlights how implicit attitudes about gender and science continue to have repercussions for women \(and other folks, though in different ways\) in the United States, a fairly high-GGGI country.) may be unfocussed, and therefore blind to the ways in which gender shapes the treatment of people. Without a movement to address gendered disparities, they could be ignored.
1.5.4.3.3.1. Pro: Women have historically been regarded as an [object of exchange](https://psychcentral.com/lib/women-as-property-an-existential-challenge-in-psychotherapy-part-2#1) between men. If women didn't organise around gender, it would be difficult to make changes to these systems.
1.5.4.3.3.2. Con: It is unclear why womanhood is a unique aspect of identity that could not be covered by race or [class sensitive approaches](https://newrepublic.com/article/154996/myth-class-reductionism)(Black, female, and trans people tend to be disproportionately working class. So any measure to advance broad downward economic redistribution—from Medicare for All to a $15 hourly minimum wage—can’t coherently be said to thwart the interests of women, racial minorities, or other identity groups. What’s more, this brand of class denialism artificially separates race, gender, and other ascriptive identities from the basic dynamics of American capitalism. True, African Americans, Latinos, and women are disproportionately poor or working class due to a long history of racial and gender discrimination in labor and housing markets—conditions that have worsened alongside the postwar deindustrialization of American cities. But this means that these populations would benefit disproportionately from initiatives geared to improve the circumstances of poor and working-class people in general.).
1.5.4.3.4. Con: Due to the changes that feminism has driven, women are now [increasingly](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/29/women-better-off-far-from-equal-men) able to climb to the top of society. This campaigning is necessary to reduce sexism.
1.5.4.3.4.1. Pro: Feminist support enables and empowers female politicians to be [more effective](https://gsdrc.org/document-library/quotas-add-women-and-stir/)(Women political representatives are most effective where a strong and engaged local feminist movement supports them, and where they have a strong sense of representing a constituency.) in their roles, improving life for many women.
1.5.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: Boston [elected](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/michelle-wu-boston-mayor-first-woman-person-of-color) its first woman of color as mayor, mainly through the support of the progressive feminist movement. Her policies may greatly [improve](https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2021/09/23/michelle-wu-wants-to-change-more-than-policies-in-boston-shes-aiming-to-change-its-politics-too)(Recently, Boston officials declared a plan to transfer some people experiencing homelessness from Mass. and Cass to live in a hotel in Revere, a move that was met with resistance from that city's mayor.

1.5.4.3.4.1.2. Con: Female politicians may [attempt](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/hillary-clinton-feminist-icon-jessa-crispin) to sell themselves as feminist icons, despite not contributing to the movement, which may distort voter perceptions to negative ends.
1.5.4.3.4.1.3. Pro: Empowering women to take political roles may make societies [more caring](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/women-political-leaders-key-to-more-equal-and-caring-societies) and healthier.
1.5.4.3.4.1.4. Con: Right-wing female candidates often pander to women voters, appearing to [espouse](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/26/opinions/republican-fake-feminism-might-work-filipovic/index.html) feminist ideals in order to garner more votes.
1.5.4.3.4.2. Con: Women hold fewer positions of power because of their life choices, rather than systemic discrimination. Therefore, feminism has not corrected any injustice by changing preferences.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1. Pro: Though feminists suggest that there is a wage gap, its existence is [disputed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html) and is unlikely to have come from sexist origins.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.1. Con: [EU figures](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics) show an \(unadjusted\) average 16.2% gap \(2016, gross hourly earnings\).
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: [Childbearing](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty), which contributes significantly to the pay gap, is determined by physiology and not influenced by historic or societal sexism.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.3. Con: A [2018 survey](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/03/24/482141/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/)(Analyzing the most recent Census Bureau data from 2018, women of all races earned, on average, just 82 cents for every $1 earned by men of all races.3 This calculation is the ratio of median annual earnings for women working full time, year round to those of their male counterparts, and it translates to a gender wage gap of 18 cents. When talking about the wage gap for women, it is important to highlight that there are significant differences by race and ethnicity. The wage gap is larger for most women of color.) of women in the US indicated that on average they earn 18 cents less per dollar than their male peers.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.4. Con: Factors such as role or hours are [determined](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/equal-pay/causes-unequal-pay-between-men-and-women_en) by societal or historical sexism, and continue to maintain or worsen the pay gap.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.4.1. Pro: Women are [paid less](http://www.yalescientific.org/2013/02/john-vs-jennifer-a-battle-of-the-sexes/) for doing the same jobs with the same experience; the only difference therefore is due to sexism.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.4.2. Pro: There may not be a huge gap when you compare men and women in the same job, but [female-dominated jobs](https://timewise.co.uk/article/article-real-reasons-behind-gender-pay-gap/)(We know that many of the more poorly-paid occupations are those traditionally done by women, requiring skills traditionally regarded as ‘feminine’, such as people skills and caring skills. So women ‘choose’ to work as nurses, teachers, or shop assistants, while men ‘choose’ to be surgeons, construction workers or engineers. The issue here is that we undervalue traditionally female skills – and that will take a while to change.\n\nBut there is also a perceived wisdom that women choose low-paid occupations because they offer more flexibility, or are more family-friendly. Again, the perception that it is a choice to prioritise children over paid work, rather than being due to a lack of viable alternatives, positions the gender pay gap as a fact of life, and releases employers from responsibility for changing it.), such as social care and nursing, are paid less than male-dominated fields.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.4.3. Con: The gender pay gap is often conflated with the unadjusted pay gap. When all variables other than gender are controlled for, such as hours worked, occupation, education, the pay gap reduces \([p. 2](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf)(Based on more than 505,000 salaries shared by full-time U.S. employees on Glassdoor, men earn 24.1 percent higher base pay than women on average. In other words, women earn about 76 cents per dollar men earn. This is consistent \nwith official sources that show women earn on average 75 to 80 cents per dollar earned by men. However, comparing workers with similar age, education and years \nof experience shrinks that gap to 19.2 percent. Further, comparing workers with the same job title, employer and location, the gender pay gap in the U.S. falls to 5.4 percent \(94.6 cents per dollar\). \n• We find a similar pattern in all five countries we examined: a large overall or “unadjusted” gender pay gap, which shrinks to a smaller “adjusted” pay gap once statistical controls are added.)\).
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.4.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.6. Pro: Measures of the gender pay gap among recent college graduates show a reverse wage gap; women now [make 8% more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html) than their male counterparts.
1.5.4.3.4.2.1.7. Pro: The gendered wage gap is thought to be between 4.8 and 7.1%, which is within one standard deviation. This is insignificant from a statistical standpoint \([p. 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195224/http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf)\).
1.5.4.3.4.2.2. Con: Both men and women are subject to [environmental forces](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/) which influence their decisions. With feminism, we can eliminate unfair targeting, and allow more people to enter into careers which previously they may not have considered.
1.5.4.3.4.2.3. Pro: Women were able to reach the top of society before feminism existed. Both [Cleopatra](https://www.history.com/news/10-little-known-facts-about-cleopatra) and [Maria Theresa](https://www.dw.com/en/what-made-austrias-maria-theresa-a-one-of-a-kind-ruler/a-37935974) were leaders of their respective states.
1.5.4.3.4.2.3.1. Con: Both [Cleopatra](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-cleopatra-151356013/) and [Maria Theresa](https://www.habsburger.net/en/persons/habsburg-emperor/maria-theresa) rose to power due to lineage. Their ascension had nothing to do with their successes.
1.5.4.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: Whilst historically women did not regularly reach the top of society, they still existed in [prominent positions](https://www.history.com/news/royal-mistress-power-england-france-prince-william), and were successful enough to benefit from [regal patronage](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18wa/hd_18wa.htm)(Between 1780 and 1810, many French women painters reached impressive heights of artistic achievement and professional success. Despite a cap on the number of women admitted to France’s prestigious Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, and restrictions that barred women from the life drawing classes attended by young men aspiring to paint historical narratives, women ranked among the most sought-after artists in Paris in the 1780s. Three of the Académie’s four female members—Adélaïde Labille-Guiard \(1749–1803\), Anne Vallayer-Coster \(1744–1818\), and Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun \(1755–1842\)—regularly exhibited at the biennial Salons.\n\nRoyal women were the most important patrons for many women artists.).
1.5.4.3.4.2.3.3. Pro: Historically, women could take on roles in [business](https://www.cam.ac.uk/citywomen), be [merchants](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-british-studies/article/abs/female-merchants-women-debt-and-trade-in-later-medieval-england-12661532/E8F38B5B164098694C3C518B4AAF114F), and run [apothecaries](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/womens-business-17th-century-female-pharmacists).
1.5.4.3.4.3. Con: The existence of women leaders in prominent and powerful positions is evidence that equality of opportunity has been achieved; feminism is no longer necessary.
1.5.4.3.4.3.1. Pro: Many companies [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/ten-things-to-know-about-gender-equality)(The research finds that 87 percent of North American companies today report gender diversity is a top priority, compared with 74 percent in 2015, but this reported priority still needs to translate into more decisive action. Representation of women in the C-suite in North America has increased to 21 percent, from 17 percent in 2015.) that gender parity is a top priority for them, signalling further that equality of opportunity has either been achieved or will be soon.
1.5.4.3.4.3.2. Con: Given the [glass cliff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass-cliff.asp) phenomenon, women in leadership do not signal gender parity; equality is only achieved when all positions have roughly equal gender representation.
1.5.4.3.4.3.3. Pro: A patriarchal status quo does not exist in many Western societies, as evidenced by women in positions of power. [Theresa May](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/theresa-may-to-promote-women-as-she-becomes-prime-minister), [Hillary Rodham Clinton](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/266407-was-hillary-clinton-better-ambassador-secretary-state), and [Kamala Harris](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/07/930858267/game-changer-kamala-harris-makes-history-as-next-vice-president?t=1635775764602) demonstrate the heights women can achieve.
1.5.4.3.4.3.4. Con: The US senate is overwhelmingly male, with a sparse handful of current and former [female senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/ListofWomenSenators.htm).
1.5.4.3.4.3.5. Con: In 2017, there were [only 15](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/08/women-leaders-around-the-world/)(There are 15 female world leaders currently in office, eight of whom are their country’s first woman in power, according to our analysis of data from WEF and other sources.) female world leaders in office in the world, eight of whom were their country’s first woman in power.
1.5.4.3.4.4. Pro: [More women](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) are in C-suite positions in Fortune 500 companies than ever before.
1.5.4.3.4.4.1. Pro: Even the increased number of women on boards represents [just 6%](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) of C-suite positions, speaking to the level of past inequality and the success of feminism in correcting inequality.
1.5.4.3.4.4.2. Con: Many changes facilitated by feminism are too slow. [In the G7](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/women-in-business-2016/), just 22% of senior roles are occupied by women and 39% of companies have no women at all in senior roles.
