Discussion Name: Is Communism Actually Viable In The USA?

1. Communism Is Viable in the USA.
1.1. Con: Communism has not been shown to be viable anywhere.
1.1.1. Con: Cuba, despite a direct invasion attempt and near constant pressure from the United States is not only a viable nation, it is a successful one, with exceptional healthcare and a [HDI above average for Latin America and the Caribbean](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/CUB.pdf)
1.1.1.1. Con: Cuba now [recognizes individual property ownership](http://theconversation.com/cuba-private-home-ownership-recognised-for-first-time-since-the-revolution-100204) to allow free market mechanisms to boost GDP growth because their socialist policies are unsustainable. Though this does not imply a completely free market and a return to capitalism, it indicates that a communist market structure is not viable.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Cuba is allowing more private entreprises except in healthcare and the media](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2021/02/cuba-expands-the-private-sector-to-spark-economy.html) . The main part of communism that stays is the authoritarian one.
1.1.1.2. Con: Cuba was [economically propped up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba%E2%80%93Venezuela_relations#Economic_ties) by the USSR and then Venezuela. Viable nations aren't charity cases.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Venezuela exports subsidised oil to Cuba in return for 30,000 to 50,000 technical personnel sent to Venezuela, including physicians, sport coaches, teachers, and arts instructors who offer social services, often in poverty-stricken regions. Venezuela also sends patients to Cuba for free medical treatment.Trade between two nations is not equivalent to charity.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba%E2%80%93Venezuela_relations#Economic_ties)
1.1.1.2.2. Con: It takes a lot of support from international allies if a state wishes to exclude or impede the development of Western markets in the region.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: It's difficult to resist the expansion of an economy whose dynamic influence is the product of decentralized decisionmaking by private owners of the means of production and their operation for profit.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Even if Cuba were very poor, for the sake of argument, state authority and legitimacy is not totally dependent on economic prowess.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Laos is officially a socialist country and has a human development index far below that of Cuba.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Government legitimacy can flow from mustering powerful ideologies that inspire cooperation and support of the people without necessarily generating a lot of wealth.
1.1.1.4. Con: Communism in Cuba has not been a success. Much of the Cuban populus has tried to flee, with [many attempting to turn cars into boats to sail to the US.](http://floatingcubans.com/)
1.1.2. Con: The USSR went toe-to-toe with the greatest superpower of the world for around 50 years. It's been viable even in a country such as Russia, with poor agricultural ability. The USSR's ability to compete on anywhere near the same level as the US on such fields as Nuclear technology, space travel, and military capability is remarkable, especially for a country that, through WW1, was barely able to provide uniforms or guns for their soldiers. It's been shown to be viable.
1.1.2.1. Pro: USSR literacy rate was 99.9%, whereas Imperial Russia had up to 60% illiteracy rates among peasants.
1.1.2.2. Con: Treating "went toe-to-toe with the greatest superpower of the world for 50 years" as an achievement is conceding enough ground already if given without the pro-USSR spin: The communist empire and her client states went up against the capitalist empire and her client states. The former had the larger population and land area. The latter won.
1.1.2.3. Con: That a nation was more economically and technologically developed in 1950 than 1900 is not at all remarkable in and of itself, and Russia and the United States were both great powers at the beginning of the 20th century.
1.1.2.4. Con: Economic growth in poorer nations tends to be faster than in richer nations, so emphasising the relative poverty of the Russian Empire compared to the other great powers of the world does not make a case for the USSR's achievements being more impressive.
1.1.2.5. Pro: Examples like Thomas Sankara show that that affirmation is untrue. Furthermore, Russia managed to go from an impoverished and agrarian country in 1915 to a fully industrial superpower able to win WWII in a few years. Later on, they managed to keep a steady [growth rate](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwim2b_I6KLfAhUQaBoKHYvEDdcQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintil.com%2F2016%2F03%2F26%2Fthe-soviet-union-gdp-growth%2F&psig=AOvVaw3oxHTDbvBlH2BIcYW7nwFm&ust=1544997025087790), high employment and high [calorie consumption](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00274R000300150009-5.pdf)while achieving scientific and technical advancements like the Sputnik.
1.1.2.6. Con: Only two areas where the USSR was able to "go toe-to-toe", military and space. Notice a key element here is competition with the U.S.. As military dominance was at the top of the USSR's agenda,[the sector enjoyed much more favourable conditions, at the cost of other civillian sectors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_Soviet_Union#Military-industrial_complex_and_the_economy) As a whole, military might is a weak measure of a country's overall prosperity. Something like GDP/capita, nutritional stats, life expectancy, levels of reported well being, would be much better.
1.1.2.7. Pro: "Viable" does not equal "has been the most competitive political doctrine, to date".
1.1.3. Pro: Communism is not a viable option for people who want to own property. In a communist country, your possessions are not your own, but community owned.
1.1.3.1. Pro: More importantly, individuals do not own businesses, farms, or factories. All of these "means of production" are owned by the government. And because the government owns them all, there is [no price competition](https://fee.org/articles/the-soviets-tried-to-run-an-economy-without-market-prices/). This causes [real problems](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/weekinreview/where-communist-economics-fell-short.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=82FD003178FB75EA9656C427E15966F2&gwt=pay), because [competitive bidding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem) for resources is the best way to allocate them productively.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Internal competition results in lower prices than external competition ever could, as no capitalist company would ever attempt to undercut itself.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: A government company with no competitors could focus solely on increasing efficiency.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: A private company with no competitors could also focus solely on increasing efficiency. This does not mean we have any reason to expect that either type of company actually would do such a thing.
1.1.3.2. Con: This does not make a distinction between personal and private property, where private property is used to make money, and personal property is things like your tooth-brush or your bed. Resources like the means of production are \(depending on the Communism in question\) owned by the Government for usage for the good of the people, or the workers, so as not to exploit their labour.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: In the 21st century, one of the most prominent means of production is the personal computer, which may be either personal or private property depending on context and on who you ask. This example is indicative that the distinction between the two is not well-founded; there is not "private" and "personal" property, there's just property.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: There is already an accepted distinction between private and personal property in the context of workplaces: your work computer belongs to the business \(or under communism, the workers\) and your home computer belongs to you. This could be easily continued to communism, with minor changes such as land being government-owned.
1.1.3.3. Con: In communist countries, [private companies](https://en.luathongduc.com/setting-up-foreign-company-in-vietnam) such as Trung Nguyen Coffee in Vietnam do exist. Some communist countries opened their doors to the world and accepted the investment of foreign enterprises.
1.1.3.4. Pro: People treat property they don't own poorly. This was frequently observed in [GDR.](https://www.svz.de/regionales/mecklenburg-vorpommern/politik/als-25-trabis-einfach-falsch-abbogen-id4967721.html)
1.1.3.4.1. Con: A solution would be to assign responsibilities to individuals.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Being made responsible for what happens to property you don't have any more ownership or rights over than your neighbours is unjust.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The police assume such responsibility for the sake of justice.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: To assign people the role of police - i.e. to conscript them into the police - would also be unjust.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: Public property is not always treated poorly.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Volunteers work to [restore public forests](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/ct-sta-winter-volunteers-st-0116-20170113-story.html) lost through no fault of their own.
1.1.3.5. Con: China's policy of government owned land has resulted in the [largest real estate market in the world.](https://web.archive.org/web/20100304151057/http://www.livetradingnews.com/china-the-worlds-largest-real-estate-market-9845.htm)
1.1.4. Con: Communist entities, called [Kibbutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz), work well for farms and other various industries in Israel which has a modern economy that is similar to the US economy.
1.1.4.1. Pro: [Kibbutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz) make up for US $9.7 billion of Israel's economy.
1.1.5. Con: It has. The socialist uprisings of the 20th century faced intense military and [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba) attacks from a coalition of superior nations, and lingering internal adversaries. However, some were able to drastically improve the condition of society, from education, to industry, to life expectancy. Their ability to resist global capitalist power is a factor to be considered, in absence of a historical socialist power that remained unmolested.
1.1.5.1. Con: Cuba became a vassal nation under the protection of the Soviet Union for decades until the Soviet Union itself failed. A blockade by one country was hardly an "intense attack."
1.1.5.1.1. Con: According to the UN, the US embargo has cost Cuba [$130 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un-idUSKBN1IA00T) in losses.
1.1.5.2. Con: The socialist uprisings of the 20th century did not result in long-term, sustainable socialist societies.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: The [Soviet Union](https://off-guardian.org/2018/02/19/yanks-to-the-rescue-times-not-so-secret-story-of-how-american-advisers-helped-yeltsin-win-the-1996-presidential-election/) lasted for roughly 80 years and only collapsed due to US interference in their elections. Cuba has been [excelling](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/multimedia/Cubas-Achievements-Over-the-Decades-20160318-0035.html) in recent years, despite the continuation of the US embargo.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Cubans often have to share one vehicle amongst 10 to 25 people because they have a shortage of automobiles. Their cars are vastly fuel inefficient Frankenstein vehicles, compromised of 1950's American bodies, and 1980's Russian internal parts. Similarly they have severely under developed [Infrastructure](http://fortune.com/2016/03/29/stop-saying-americans-are-going-to-spoil-cuba/) \(roads, electricity, plumbing\), outside of Havanah and the resort areas. Recent progress being made is largely coming from slow the death of the communist [Regime](https://havanatimes.org/?p=135648).
1.1.5.2.1.2. Con: Although the Soviet Union may have been strong as a state, it does not mean that the state was effective towards harboring a sustainable society. For example: [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor), as well as other atrocities which faced Soviet society at the time
1.1.5.2.1.3. Con: Cuba is a failed state with a small upper class and a huge dirt-poor population who cannot get medicine. Cuba relies on donor countries like North Korea, Venezuela, and others.
1.1.5.2.1.3.1. Con: A [major cause](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/03/01/cuba-is-poor-but-who-is-to-blame-castro-or-50-years-of-the-us-blockade/) of poverty in Cuba is the sanctions placed on it by the US.
1.1.5.3. Con: Without any source and without naming any specific nation the aforementioned point is pure conjecture.
1.1.5.4. Con: The most notable examples of Communism ie the Soviet Union and [Mao's China](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html) did not produce these "improvements". They lead to mass murder and [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333). [\[1\]](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/02/05/who-killed-more-hitler-stalin-or-mao/) [\[2\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/red-famine-anne-applebaum-ukraine-soviet-union/542610/)
1.1.5.5. Con: A system of government that has [murdered more millions of citizens than the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism#Estimated_number_of_victims), in each of it's attempted countries, has not improved the condition of society, education, industry, or life expectancy. It has, in fact, desecrated them.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: The Black Book of Communism was [admonished publicly](https://medium.com/\@discomfiting/debunking-communism-killed-more-people-than-naziism-7a9880696f67) by contributors and it's publisher due to it's inaccurate and inflatory statistics. WWII killed 75-80 million people.
1.1.5.5.2. Con: A system of government is incapable of murdering people.
1.1.5.5.3. Con: Murdering the proletariat indicates that the country conducting such actions is not communist.
1.1.5.5.4. Pro: One does not become ‘richer’ by the murder of their brother or grandchild, yet this is the economic claim of Communism after bloody revolution and disastrous policies which resulted in starvation, murder and abortion. China’s ‘loneliest generation’ grew up without siblings and many feel they were unwilling victims of a social experiment for economic prosperity. [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/world/asia/china-one-child-policy-loneliest-generation.html)
1.1.5.5.4.1. Con: Most communist states, flaws and all, did in fact create massive growth as industrialization was implemented. Perhaps attempting socialism with such limited means causes strains on it's people, but this is not an argument about 20th century attempts at socialism, the argument is whether it is viable in the United States.
1.1.6. Pro: Communism knows nothing of value hierarchies. Rather than acknowledging that capitalism is a hierarchical structure that best serves humanity \(with acknowledged casualties\), communism defines reality as "oppressors" and "oppressed", where the "oppressed" are allowed to any and all evils to destroy the hierarchy/"oppressors". Unfortunately there are thousands of hierarchies, which is why communism devoured millions of "oppressors" in the last century, as each hierarchy got its "turn".
1.1.6.1. Con: Historical materialism does not make value judgements. Marx did not assume the feudal lords to be the "oppressor", and the bourgeoisie the "oppressed". Material realities and internal economic contradiction necessitated the overthrow of feudalism. As Marx said would also occur to capitalism, due to its contradictions.
1.1.6.2. Con: This exact argument can be used in favor of monarchy, but most developed countries have either abolished or disempowered it.
1.1.7. Pro: Communism as a whole is entirely too exploitable to ever be a sustainable system of government. We should however take some of Marx's criticisms of capitalism to heart. His diagnosis was spot on, but his prescription is worse than the disease.
1.1.7.1. Con: Marx never prescribed any specific type of socialism. He never mentioned the state, or state ownership, only that "the workers should control the means of production". Your impression of "his prescription" are actually the prescriptions of Vladimir Lenin.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Communism goes against the basic way humans act. We work because we must. If the state is taking care of us, we will work the least amount possible. Hence the collapse of every communist country on earth.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: [Zipf's Principle of Least Effort](https://www.thoughtco.com/principle-of-least-effort-zipfs-law-1691104)
1.1.8. Pro: All previous iterations of Communism have failed and, despite cries of "that wasn't true Communism", they were.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The examples of Russia and China spring immediately to mind.
1.1.8.2. Con: This, ironically, only works if you consider China and North Korea to be examples of "not true communism." They have no yet failed, so either they are communist and the point is moot, or they are not, and the cries of "not true communism" have nuance more than you admit in your point.
1.1.8.3. Pro: In the majority of times a communist revolution has turned into a dictatorship.
1.1.8.3.1. Con: It not necessary that communism become a dictatorship in the USA.
1.1.8.3.1.1. Con: American culture magnifies the merit of hard-working, a typical USA outsider's stereotype is that they are "[workaholics](https://www.businessinsider.com/r-checking-work-emails-at-home-its-part-of-the-job-for-most-americans-2015-7)". A government system that doesn't remunerate hard work above the average would not be viable, not only because it is doomed to failure from a [psychological standpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effort_justification), but because American cultural aspects regarding private property and freedom wouldn't be compatible with it. There's no way to ensure a stable and non conflicting Communist Regime without a dictatorship.
1.1.8.3.1.1.1. Con: Communists seek to achieve communism over the long term, in the short term establishing Socialism. Under Socialism, workers are rewarded equivalent to their contribution, unlike Capitalism where a portion of what they produce is retained by their employer simply by virtue of owning capital. Thus, Socialism, collective rather than individual ownership of the means of production, remunerates hard work better than Capitalism. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution)
1.1.8.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Under Capitalism, accepting the wage you are provided by an employer is tacit acceptance that the work you are doing is worth what you receive.
1.1.8.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Accepting the wage can be out of necessity rather than acceptance of the evaluation.
1.1.8.3.1.2. Pro: Culture is not immutable. American society could change to be compatible with a society which did not include private ownership of the means of production.
1.1.8.3.1.3. Con: One cannot control the direction of future politics by good wishes. History shows us a despot will eventually rise to power at some point. Communism maintains the power of such despots, as we have seen in North Korea.
1.1.8.3.1.4. Con: It is much easier to plan around the ills of the human character rather then it's positives. When communism is ready to deal with the vices of the human spirit without the need to reeducate or murder those people then it will be a viable alternative to democracy/Republic/liberal ideals.
1.1.8.3.2. Con: This would inherently mean it isn't communist. A dictatorship is incompatible with democratic control of resources.
1.1.8.3.3. Con: By utilizing the separation of powers, communism will not turn into a dictatorship. The typical division is into three branches: a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. In the past, there was no separation of powers, when those communism turned into dictatorship. Those president or chairman had power to manipulate almost everything. While if there is an independent judicial system, people can start a vote of no confidence etc. Communism is not necessarily related to dictatorship.
1.1.8.3.4. Con: The US could become a dictatorship in the process of becoming communist - but that doesn't mean it is impossible for the US to be communist.
1.1.8.3.5. Pro: The US was built upon and fought for tenets antithetical to Communism; individualism and self-actualization, as well as to be freed from the repressions of tyranny. Communism is designed to be "benevolent tyranny".
1.1.8.3.5.1. Con: Communism is designed to destroy the 'benevolent tyranny' of businesses run by the few by exploiting the many. By adopting communism, all business becomes democratic, with the many making the decisions about the business, and no one taking out more than they put in. In this sense, the ability to express your ideas in your work and be free from the typical top-down power structure of capitalism is well within the USA's founding freedoms.
1.1.8.3.5.2. Pro: The system by which the state runs business and commerce is the system by which all individual choice is dead. When you can no longer influence the market through your choices, you lose your democratic say in the market.
1.1.8.3.6. Pro: Communism has a common flaw of assuming that its leadership will not act against the interests of its government \(corruption/nepotism/poorly researched public and military policy/etc.\). This is why most concepts of communism have quickly transformed into irreversible despotism when applied to a federal level in many countries very early on. It would have many of these same issues if it was applied to any large country. There are many other reasons, but this one is seldom addressed.
1.1.8.4. Con: There have not been any communist nations [by definition](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/what-difference-between-communism-and-socialism.asp). Communism and Socialism are terms often used interchangeably but are pretty different and no country has ever called itself communist or claimed to have achieved communism.
1.1.9. Con: Countries with the strongest social safety nets \(which is wealth redistribution\) consistently [rank highest for citizen well-being](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/quality-of-life-rankings).
1.1.9.1. Con: The Scandinavian countries that dominate these metrics are not Communist. They are balanced welfare states with a decentralized market economy.
1.1.9.2. Con: The topic of the discussion is not what the optimal ratio of wealth redistribution for market economies is, it's specifically arguing the viability of Communism.
1.1.9.3. Pro: The Scandinavian countries also have [higher social mobility than the U.S](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/the-american-dream-isnt-alive-in-denmark/494141/) [\[1\]](https://voxeu.org/article/intergenerational-mobility-denmark-and-us) [\[2\]](https://www.theglobalist.com/social-mobility-in-northern-europe/)
1.1.9.3.1. Con: A social-democratic state with public spending does [not qualify](https://www.marottaonmoney.com/looking-backward-on-socialism-a-false-appeal-to-nordic-countries/) as communist or "socialist". The Nordic region upholds a capitalist liberal economy that can sustain a tax heavy environment among its citizens, hence the lack of a budgetary deficit.
1.1.10. Pro: Communism will only be viable when mankind become machine, without any individual will, just a collective obedience to the system.
1.1.10.1. Con: Basically every economic or political system would work, if there was no individual will. The existence of individual will is not by itself a threat to communism. It would be if the communism system was imposed by an higher authority, like a totalitarian regime. But of course that would work with any economic system, even feudalism. Communism is not about dictatorship, is about having an economic system based on equality and common goals, while capitalism is based on greed and individual gain.
1.1.10.1.1. Con: Individual will certainly is a threat to communism that is without a totalitarian regime. If only one person's will opposes it, there are two options - let the person live however he wants, or shut the person down by a totalitarian regime, so in the end you need a totalitarian regime.
1.1.10.1.2. Con: People are not equal, they are not the same, they differ, most importantly when it comes to competence. Hierarchies of competence exist and are fundamentally good. The system that lets the hierarchies of competence freely form is capitalism. It's not about greed, it's about your essential right to pursue happiness, coming from the right to freedom, coming from the right to live.
1.1.10.2. Pro: The basic human flaw of selfishness and greed naturally disagrees with a political and government enforced policy that states that people should share what they have worked for. It seems to be a general consensus that if you work harder than someone else, but they receive the same benefits, that this is unfair. Let us also be aware that having someone work less, but receive the same thing is what the political Left calls "privilege". Possible situational irony is detected.
1.1.10.3. Con: The same could be said of capitalism. Capitalism is only viable when everybody acts rationally and behaves in a way which does not deviate from what the system can deal with.
1.1.10.3.1. Con: The previous statement is wrong. Capitalism is based on and thrives with individualism. As for rational behavior, nothing fails when all participants act rationally. Yet the key word is participation. Communism ends participation within society for people. It becomes pointless to contribute and work day in and day out when you will not benefit from your own labors. Because all the energy normally given to the person who did the work goes to everyone else.
1.1.10.3.2. Con: Rational behavior is nothing more than acting in one's own interest. Capitalism is nothing more than private ownership of businesses. A business owner can sell his business, chase new markets, invest and expand, or coast to retirement, depending on what he/she prefers. The business will either succeed or fail, depending on his decisions. In any case, the owner has a stake in the outcome, so works hard to make the best decisions possible.
1.1.10.3.3. Con: The phrase "what the system can deal with" makes no sense in this context. There is no "system" other than human nature.
1.1.10.4. Pro: The aforementioned statement is the absolute truth. Individualism is the heart of free markets. Communism removes individualism from society which in turn ends human participation within society.
1.1.10.5. Con: Communism doesn't require the removal of individual will.
1.1.11. Con: Governmentally enforced communism has not been shown to be viable anywhere.
1.1.11.1. Pro: In governmentally-enforced communism, communal feelings and needs are bypassed. There is no need to believe in communism when it is governmentally enforced, only to comply with its demands. This makes it significantly less sustainable.
1.1.12. Pro: Communist regimes killed millions.[Wikipedia Communist Mass Killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes)
1.1.13. Con: China, a communistic country, is considered a rival to the US as an [economy](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-now-world%E2%80%99s-largest-economy-we-shouldn%E2%80%99t-be-shocked-170719).
1.1.13.1. Con: The reason China's economy sky rocketed was because of the cheap labor that American capitalist countries took advantage of.
1.1.13.1.1. Pro: [This can be observed in China's GDP growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp), when compared to when [major companies started moving their factories overseas](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2016/chinas-rapid-rise-from-backward-agrarian-society-to-industrial-powerhouse-in-just-35-years)
1.1.13.2. Con: China isn't wholly communist though - it uses a system called a [socialist market economy](https://asialinkbusiness.com.au/china/getting-started-in-china/chinas-economy?doNothing=1) which takes from both communism and capitalism.
1.1.14. Con: Such comparisons are not pragmatic. Communism in Russia started after WW1 that led to the Civil war that by sheer luck ended up with Communism there and the devastation was concluded with WW2. It is the same as comparing two athletes and one of them was shot in the foot. Still, the USSR after all this devastation managed a lot prior to its collapse.
1.2. Con: Unlike capitalism, communism is incompatible with the freedoms and liberties of a free society.
1.2.1. Pro: Communism suppresses freedom. Cuban ambassador, Che Guevara has admitted to the executing of Cuban opposition during a United Nations assembly. The USA was built upon Economic and Thought freedom, a Communist system there would be nonviable because of that.
1.2.1.1. Con: There are numerous examples of the United states engaging in the suppression of freedom. From suppressing natives, violent revolution, violent civil war, targeted police brutality against black movements, and the global campaign against communism, both installing anti communist dictators to outright invasion, on the basis of ideas.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: That's not capitalism's fault, but rather the government's. None of the things you mentioned are inextricably linked to capitalism or avoided by communism \(except, obviously, anti-communist militarism, but just replace that with [anti-capitalist militarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution) for the same effect\). And why would you want a government who [commits](https://www.britannica.com/event/Japanese-American-internment) [so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege) [many](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maryland-officers-serving-red-flag-gun-removal-order-fatally-shoot-armed-man/) [injustices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre) to also have [full control](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-communism-so-often-lead-to-corruption) over the economy? [Economic freedom is tied to social freedom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1f4u1a/is_economic_freedom_linked_to_political_and/), so we should strive for more of it rather than less.
1.2.1.2. Con: Both Capitalist and Communist governments seek to control their populations for intended goals \(either benefit capital or community\).
1.2.1.3. Con: Every society suppresses freedom in exchange for safety and efficiency \(e.g. you lose the freedom to murder so that you don't get murdered; losing freedom to pollute freely, etc\).
1.2.2. Con: Scandinavian countries \(which are comparatively very socialist\) consistently [rank highest](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/quality-of-life-rankings) for overall citizen well-being \(happiness, education, homelessness, life-span, nominal income, etc\). These countries sacrifice no freedoms compared to USA.
1.2.2.1. Con: Well-being and freedom are different things; consider the wellbeing and freedom of a domestic dog, compared to a feral dog or a wolf. Citing good numbers for well-being does not make the case that these countries sacrifice no freedoms.
1.2.2.2. Con: Scandinavian countries are not socialist, they are capitalist states with elements of socialism. In fact, they are [more capitalist than the USA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/democrats-use-nordic-nations-as-models-of-socialism-they-actually-involve-a-lot-of-capitalism/2019/06/24/b6d9bbdc-945c-11e9-b58a-a6a9afaa0e3e_story.html) in some aspects.
1.2.2.3. Con: The demographics of Scandinavian countries are very different. The population is [much smaller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_\(United_Nations\)) and more homogeneous than the US. Ethnic differences and tensions are serious issues the US faces that make it unique among the nations.
1.2.3. Con: Communism can only work in a free society. Democratic control of public resources requires democracy.
1.2.3.1. Con: Democracy and freedom are not equivalent. A pure democracy that is beholden to the tyranny of the majority need not respect the freedoms and liberties of the minority.
1.2.4. Con: The USA does not provide everyone with the freedoms for personal improvement \(access to quality education, jobs, healthcare, etc\).
1.2.4.1. Con: Freedom of access to quality education, healthcare, and jobs must either infringe on the freedoms of the teacher, the doctor and the employer, or it must simply further the government's infringement on the property rights of the population via ever-higher taxes.
1.2.4.2. Pro: It is more difficult for the homeless or those in poverty to access the same jobs or schools due to the lack of money, housing, or education.
1.2.5. Con: Socialism is not the same as communism. Socialism is like halfway to communism, but it is roughly equivalent to everyone being middle class.
1.2.5.1. Con: Socialism results in a [two-class state](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/the-truth-about-socialism-it-doesnt-care-about-the-middle-class-its-about). The permanent ruling elite with economic riches and the permanent poor who cannot buy food.
1.2.6. Pro: When a country becomes a socialist state, the focus becomes what is best for society and less about what is best for the individual within. The freedoms of USA provide for personal improvement to excel, while a communistic society wants control.
1.2.6.1. Pro: In the US, people have the ability to improve their socioeconomic status, this is a key tenet of the American Dream. Communism doesn't give the average person this chance.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Being about making more money, keeping that money, and furthering yourself is the reason why innovations occur the most in America. In Communism, that money and innovation belongs to the state, so no one innovates as much \(if at all\). There's no incentive to because the government takes it all.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Communism supports working for the collective, and does not allow working for the individual or family. All must succumb to the beliefs and values of the government, and the government decides how much each person receives. This is regardless of how much each person produces - everyone receives the same amount. Capitalism rewards those who work the hardest.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Communism strangles initiative. There is no reward for hard work. Opportunities are managed by the state.
1.2.7. Pro: Communism cuts down on the autonomy of individuals.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Communism would require handing over all economic authority to a central government. People could not own businesses or land, and what would be available as personal property would be limited. Expecting the entire population to give up their stuff is not realistic.
1.2.7.2. Pro: In general, capitalism has proven to be the [more efficient economic system](https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/03/capitalism-save-us-opinions-forbes_land.html?sh=3c336f30258c#:~:text=Capitalism%20is%20the%20world's%20greatest). While not always the most humanitarian, capitalism plays on the essential part of human nature which leads us to better ourselves through our own self-determination. Social mobility has always been possible in a capitalist society because of this. If the government is relied upon too heavily to "take care" of the citizens, autonomy will eventually disappear.
1.2.8. Con: Freedom of speech and fair trails, which are critical liberties, are not guaranteed in democratic countries.
1.2.8.1. Con: Freedom of expression and judicial liberties have been shown to be abused much more in Communist states. In China, all it takes to be imprisoned is [disagreement with the government](https://freedomhouse.org/article/china-global-leader-political-prisoners).
1.2.8.2. Con: In North Korea, Otto Warmbier was convicted of stealing a propaganda poster and was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor. This is a [violation of the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cat.aspx)
1.2.8.3. Con: [In the USSR, thousands were unjustly convicted and sent to gulags.](https://www.rferl.org/a/heirs-of-the-gulag-russia-s-prison-system-faces-harsh-scrutiny/29748646.html)
1.2.8.4. Pro: [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) doesn't believe that the US would conduct a fair trial with his case.
1.2.8.5. Pro: [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) is jailed for doing what the constitution is asking for him to do.
1.2.8.6. Pro: [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) was jailed several times for refusing to testify against WikiLeaks.
1.2.8.7. Con: If democratic countries can nevertheless be harmful to liberty, that doesn't make communism more friendly to liberty.
1.3. Pro: The United States has the economic and social characteristics conducive to the establishment of a communist regime.
1.3.1. Pro: The United States has the [highest incarceration rate in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate), save possibly North Korea. Thus, for a communist regime that needs to establish its own gulag archipelago, the infrastructure is all there.
1.3.1.1. Con: "Little information exists regarding [North Korea's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea) [incarceration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate#North_Korea) rate."
1.3.2. Con: There would be intense rebellion against the idea of communism.
1.3.2.1. Con: As conditions for the workers and the poor get worse, and alternative methods of grievance are further withered by the bourgeois, socialist sentiment will continue growing at larger rates than present.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: By historical and world standards, the poor in the USA are incredibly well off \(over [90 times](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/01/06/the-average-american-today-is-90-times-richer-than-the-average-historical-human-being/#7dc4973a3e6e) richer than the average person in the past\) and the working poor even more so. Additionally the so called workers have never actually coalesced into a single political entity at any point in US history.
1.3.2.2. Con: A violent revolt is not particularly necessary. Proliferating [worker cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative) could result in a more syndicalist approach. This would create incrementally stronger dispersion of market wealth while opening up the pathway to full worker ownership.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Communism hasn't worked out well for the people in many communist countries. It would work far less well in much of America. If one considers the USA as actually [11](http://www.businessinsider.com/regional-differences-united-states-2018-1) different distinct areas, the most populous and economically powerful of these would not submit to communist rule; thus if forced to, a large war and mass deaths would occur.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Second [amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-ii#:~:text=A%20well%20regulated%20Militia%2C%20being,Arms%2C%20shall%20not%20be%20infringed) has armed citizens specifically for this case.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Since the Cold War, Communism has been branded as a danger to America.
1.3.2.6. Con: More communists died by noncommunist invading forces of communist countries than by any rebellion during the communism.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.4. Pro: Many of the socialist programs in the USA \(social security, public education, etc.\) are [successful](https://newrepublic.com/article/122544/why-social-security-success-four-charts) and [popular](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/01/over-60-of-americans-back-tuition-free-college-survey-says.html).
1.3.4.1. Con: A key pillar of socialism is "from each according to his capability to each according to his needs." Social security is not socialist because you only get out of it a formulation according to what you put into it. It has nothing to do with your "needs"
1.3.4.2. Con: Socialist Programs are centrally controlled. Public education is not centrally controlled in Washington but is controlled and financed at the local level by fellow citizens. As a result, it is not a socialist program.
1.3.4.3. Con: Public [education](https://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%202009%20HndbEducPolicyResearch.pdf) in the [USA](https://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testing/) is a [failure](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/restoring-americas-economic-mobility/)
1.3.5. Pro: There are plenty of viable [communist or socialist companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_employee-owned_companies#United_States_of_America) in the USA which are controlled by employees.
1.3.5.1. Pro: [Ara](https://www.ara.com/company-information) is owned by all it's employees.
1.3.5.2. Pro: [Houchens Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houchens_Industries) has 2 billion dollar sales and is owned by its employees.
1.3.5.3. Con: This illustrates that a free market \(voluntary\) economy is able to accomodate all kinds of ownership arrangements and contracts. The converse is not true. If the US government were communist, then the voluntary arrangements of companies and different approaches to corporate structure would be illegal. The existence of many viable companies of many voluntarily agreed corporate structures is an argument for capitalism \(voluntarism\), not communism.
1.3.5.4. Con: Supposedly 'socialist' companies have no bearing on whether or not a nation such as the United States of America could sustain and support such a system, as a national government and a private corporation are vastly different functions.
1.3.5.5. Con: No business in the United States is communist. They exist within and benefit from marketplace capitalism. These are employee-owned, capitalist companies.
1.3.5.6. Con: Employee ownership occurring naturally within capitalism is not necessarily "communist business". Under many \(admittedly, perhaps not all\) communist theories, there are no "communist businesses", as employee ownership must be the product of a violent revolution, personal property would be eliminated, and other conflicts.
1.3.5.7. Pro: Many, many companies practice employee ownership. [A quick list from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_employee-owned_companies) shows there are many, and many more than a skeptic might expect are 100%.
1.3.6. Pro: In the USA, some colonies were created [based on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism) the utopian socialists' approach.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Many Utopian Socialists saw in America a political reference that could lead the construction of an alternative society.
1.3.6.2. Con: Socialism only works on tiny scale societies with simple political organization, as the probity of administration is closer and manageable to its citizens.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: Land is best cared for by those who live on it. When land is owned by those who are not impacted by its destruction, it is likely to be destroyed for profit.
1.3.6.3. Con: Those colonies [starved](https://www.usagovpolicy.com/communism-and-starvation-in-early-america/) until capitalistic systems were reintroduced.
1.3.7. Con: This would result in a [second civil war](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/10/us/nevada-rancher-rangers-cattle-showdown/index.html) due to the second amendment of the constitution and many of those who would arm themselves to oppose both the economics and social aspects of communism..
1.3.7.1. Pro: Anti-communist sentiment is [increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/us/politics/china-red-scare-washington.html) in the US as a result of the actions taken by the Trump administration, which makes it more likely that people will be willing to take hostile action against those who support communism in the US.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: The vast [majority](https://www.3ccorp.net/2020/06/20/black-lives-matter-mob-throws-unknown-liquid-at-trump-supporters-waiting-to-get-in-trump-tulsa-rally/) of [violent](https://www.unionleader.com/opinion/op-eds/donald-trump-jr-media-blackout-on-anti-trump-attacks-encourages-more-violence/article_a5c8a5f1-ee7a-59de-ab12-85b1a00a1ddc.html) [action](https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/23/keveon-gomera-arrested-vandalism-providence-college-catholic-cemetery-swastika-anti-catholic/) is being done by[anti-Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=OQzEnPCQ14o&feature=emb_logo) [anarchists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=OQzEnPCQ14o&feature=emb_logo).
1.3.7.1.2. Con: The last group of militiamen who took coordinated hostile action against the Federal government was under the [Obama](https://infogalactic.com/info/Bundy_standoff) administration.
1.3.8. Con: The United States has a [history](http://www.openculture.com/2014/11/the-red-menace-a-striking-gallery-of-anti-communist-propaganda.html) of [fighting against](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/red-scare) Communist influence.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Both past and present, considering the majority that won the election in 2016.
1.3.8.2. Con: That history is now referred to as "[red scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare)" and most Americans classify it as propaganda.
1.4. Pro: Capitalism has been detrimental to the USA and the world. The profit motive intrinsically motivates immoral decisions such as industrial scale [pollution](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/26/capitalism-environment-green-greed-slow-life-symposium-tony-juniper), [wars](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/all-wars-are-bankers-wars/), and [fraud](https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/wells-fargo-ripping-off-people.html/).
1.4.1. Con: Profit is the only reliable signal that producers are creating goods/services that consumers want. Absent the profit signal, producers must either guess or be commanded \(someone else's guess\) which things to produce, and all things produced become undifferentiated commodities. See "[Inside a Soviet Childhood](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2017/12/20/this-is-how-propaganda-works-a-look-inside-a-soviet-childhood/?sh=6af8efa93566)"
1.4.2. Con: The problems you mention are overwhelmingly products of modern-day [corporatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism) and [cronyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronyism) rather than capitalism.
1.4.2.1. Pro: A [free market economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp) \(as opposed to a communist [command economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/command-economy.asp)\) simply favors voluntary transactions between individuals and companies rather than government control \(which causes problems like the [Military Industrial Complex](https://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/what-is-the-military-industrial-complex.asp)\).
1.4.2.2. Pro: A free market economy does not promote fraud/corruption [any more than communism](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-communism-so-often-lead-to-corruption), and [buyers can influence companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmainwaring/2011/09/07/the-new-power-of-consumers-to-influence-brands/#60875ee73b3c) to pollute less through their purchasing decisions.
1.4.2.3. Con: A free market cannot help those with no money. There will always be people who are unable to work. This is a problem of human rights.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: The right to work has never been a human right. The original human rights, according to John Locke, were life, liberty, and property. It is well within anyone's right to not take someone for a job.
1.4.2.3.2. Con: A free market is the best way to raise the standard of living of the most people. For those who are infirm or otherwise dependent on charity for survival, a larger population of prosperous people will be the most likely to be willing and able to help out with charitable giving.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: In the 19th century, when the US prescribed to a free market model, [philanthropy was everywhere](https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/relationship-philanthropy-industrial-revolution). Even today, when the government supplies so much, [US people are very, very generous.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/12/28/the_generosity_of_americans_139032.html)
1.4.2.4. Con: Regardless of cronyism or corporatism, capitalism prioritizes the acquisition of capital even at the expense of human well-being so long as it is within the law.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Capitalism does not prioritize acquisition of capital. Free market capitalism prioritizes individual self determination for all people and seeks to foster trade for the mutual and voluntary self-betterment of all parties involved.
1.4.3. Pro: The USA has the ability to provide the basic needs of all its people but the rules of capitalism prevents us from doing so. Only through social or public means of production can we provide for every person.
1.4.3.1. Con: Governments should not provide for citizens if citizens don't provide for the community. Only people who work and do their fair share should reap the benefits.
1.4.3.2. Con: Some of the worst modern economic famines took place in [Communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) controlled [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine).
1.4.3.3. Con: Public production or provision is not efficient in every situation.
1.4.3.4. Pro: There are [1.5 million](http://We have but . while .) empty homes but [half a million](https://www.novoco.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/hud_ahar_2018_121718.pdf) homeless people.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: Homelessness is primarily a [mental health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17061161/), [poverty, and drug addiction](https://files.hudexchange.info/reports/published/CoC_PopSub_NatlTerrDC_2019.pdf) problem, not a housing problem. Solving those issues would help the [37% of remaining homeless without housing](https://files.hudexchange.info/reports/published/CoC_PopSub_NatlTerrDC_2019.pdf).
1.4.3.5. Pro: [1 in 8](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security.aspx) Americans are food insecure while [40%](https://www.nrdc.org/issues/food-waste) of food in the US is never eaten.
1.4.3.6. Con: There will always be a pauper class. $3 Trillion was spent on a war on poverty over the last 54 years but has left America with the same percentage of poor as in 1967. Hovering about [15%, according to the national census bureau table 23](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-families.html).
1.4.4. Con: Greed is human; the profit motive is how capitalism turns people's greed to productive ends. That it sometimes fails and people still do bad things does not mean we should blame it when people are still likely to be people under communism.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The profit motive is profoundly moral, provided transactions are voluntary. It requires the profit seeker to figure out what his fellow humans desire and find a way to supply it to them. And to supply it cheaply enough for them to trade away their money for it. This is pure service to humanity. This is the system that [has produced](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty?referrer=playlist-the_best_hans_rosling_talks_yo) the material abundance to lift 90% of the world \([and counting](https://www.ted.com/playlists/474/the_best_hans_rosling_talks_yo)\) out of crushing poverty and raise living standards everywhere.
1.4.4.2. Con: The [tendency for people](https://hbr.org/2011/11/people-dont-need-a-profit-motive-to-innovate) to do things for their own satisfaction \(usually in the form of hobbies\) proves that they can work without a profit motive, therefore disproving the "human nature" argument.
1.4.5. Con: It's easy to cherry-pick problems caused by capitalism when it's the dominant system used across the world, but this doesn't prove that it's worse than other choices. Other systems might cause different, worse problems if they were as widespread.
1.4.5.1. Pro: In fact we can prove that capitalism is better than other choices. Although correlation is not always causation, sometimes it is. If you look at a [graph of human population](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/envirobiology/chapter/4-3-the-human-population/), for instance, The discovery of germs in 1670 and the resultant revolution in water purity kicks off growth. Likewise, the industrial revolution, driven by capitalists, [kicks off the explosive rise in living standards](https://www.nber.org/digest/oct99/w7148.html). Communism has never accomplished this.
1.4.6. Con: Capitalism, even with its weaknesses, is responsible for the greatest [improvement](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/12/23/14062168/history-global-conditions-charts-life-span-poverty) in the standard of living throughout all of human history.
1.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.
1.4.7. Pro: Under communism everyone [has employment and healthcare](https://www.epi.org/publication/medicare-for-all-would-help-the-labor-market/#:~:text=Fundamental%20health%20reform%20like%20“Medicare,security%20of%20households%20in%20America.&text=Boost%20wages%20and%20salaries%20by,costs%20to%20their%20workers%27%20wages.) which is what many advocate for in the United States
1.4.7.1. Con: Communism breeds black markets, effectively returning to a worse type of capitalism than the regulated capitalism practiced in the USA and that [could lead](https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/i-grew-communist-system-heres-what-americans-dont-understand-about-freedom) to new organized crime organizations.
1.4.7.2. Con: Industrial-scale pollution, wars and fraud are also common in communist zones. In the USSR there were [many super-polluted regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states#Environment), the Party waged many wars \([Romania, China, Afghanistan, Poland, Finland, Baltic states, Ukraine, Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia#Soviet_Union_\(1922%E2%80%931991\))...\), and fraud was built-in because the Communist Party [locked politics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40201689.pdf?casa_token=ygSn3I0JmycAAAAA:lqwJTiGvsUNmIK57_ClJ4FXm9uppdSUEJI4bsvibaQ5XDBUadTHZrb5_lpMBg15ig7eWRCVElDM2sxw3JvWrmW_JomgChK8Vzg7oaquFrxQeoKXtD9E) by \(in practice\) only allowing his political views \(p. 764\).
1.5. Con: American public opinion is not in favour of socialist policies. This indicates that communist policies, which are even further to the left, would be wildly unpopular.
1.5.1. Pro: Communism is the very opposite of traditional American values, such as the right to property, democracy or freedom of thought.
1.5.1.1. Pro: While many may say that traditional American values are losing their foothold, it was the majority of Americans who [elected](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president) a capitalist and proponent of conservative policy in 2016.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: The conservative candidate [lost the popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016)
1.5.1.2. Pro: Our elders died fighting against it. History shows JFK was one of the favorites of the Democrats. He [fought against](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/the-cold-war) the missile crises with Cuba, obtaining missiles from Russia, both communist at time.
1.5.1.3. Con: Communism is more democratic than capitalism, as it makes donations to politicians \(for campaigns, bribes, etc.\) impossible due to the lack of currency. This improved democracy therefore encourages freedom of thought, rather than opposing it.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Political donations can [undermine democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political-donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise) by shifting attention away from policies that would potentially make the world more equitable.
1.5.2. Con: American public opinion can change fairly rapidly, as was the case for [gay marriage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/26/how-unbelievably-quickly-public-opinion-changed-on-gay-marriage-in-6-charts/).
1.5.2.1. Con: One Supreme court ruling would not be sufficient to change the entire political and economic system of the US, particularly if it was not very popular.
1.5.2.2. Con: Giving rights to those who wish to be legally recognized as partners is a very far cry from taking the right to private property, right to bear arms and right to religious freedom from millions of Americans. One gives freedom to a very small percentage, the other takes massive amounts of freedom from the absolute majority.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: There's a gradation of rights in a capitalist society, and the 'freedom' that the US claims to uphold only appears to refer to the higher-level rights in capitalism \(like property rights\). Many 'lower-level' rights \(such as religious freedom\) remain neglected.
1.5.2.3. Con: A complete change in economic system has far more practical implications on the average person than gay marriage.
1.5.2.4. Con: American public opinion is not 100% behind gay marriage and the numerous legal changes it has initiated. This is still a divisive topic.
1.5.2.5. Con: Gay marriage was opposed mostly by the religious right a shinking group. Communism would involve the whole population and would require universal consent to work \(as dictated by communist ideal state\).
1.5.2.5.1. Con: Where Christianity is shrinking, Islam is expanding. Islam is the fastest growing religious group and is also opposed to gay marriage. [www.pewresearch.org](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/06/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/) “Islamic Law \(the Shari 'a\) is intrinsically and strongly opposed to capitalism and communism that have come to dominate the world today.” [www.al-islam.org](https://www.al-islam.org/towards-islamic-economy-ayatullah-sayyid-muhammad-baqir-sadr/seeking-islamic-alternative-capitalism)
1.5.3. Con: Socialist groups have been gaining power and [growing in popularity.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/why-are-there-suddenly-millions-of-socialists-in-america)
1.5.3.1. Pro: [Support](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/23/public-support-for-single-payer-health-coverage-grows-driven-by-democrats/) for 'socialist' measures like single-payer universal healthcare is growing.
1.5.4. Con: Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist is the [most popular](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-poll-trump-favorability-a7913306.html) American politician. Popularity of democratic socialists will ease the transition to communism.
1.5.4.1. Con: Bernie Sanders lost [two bids](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-sanders-idUSKBN20Y2PG) for his party's nomination for President and comes from a small New England State. Popularity in August of 2017 does not equate to acceptance of socialist policies.
1.5.5. Pro: The [neoliberal movement](http://www.faireconomy.org/the_politics_of_privatization) is very strong in the US.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Although the control of capitalism has gotten too far in the US, you could easily promote socialist policies such as free healthcare and free education without going full on communism.
1.5.5.2. Con: This still doesn't mean communism itself is viable; liberal policies, however, are.
1.5.6. Pro: The American people have not only the right to vote, but to protest. And if the government tried to make it viable, people would most likely protest, and riot, making it too difficult to change.
1.5.6.1. Pro: In the unlikely situation where the government would kill or imprison the protestors, if there were enough protestors, then there would be less people to pay taxes, resulting in the government losing money.
1.6. Pro: The United States has the political characteristics conducive to the establishment of the communist regime.
1.6.1. Pro: Capitalism and Communism are both methods of centralizing power in the hands of the few to control the masses more easily. One in the name of government, the other in the name of corporations. Americans already accept the rule of one, there is no reason the transition to the other should not be smooth.
1.6.1.1. Con: Capitalism itself shouldn't be classified as a method to centralizing the power. It can be classified as [State Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) or [Economic Liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism), for instance. In theory, the second one would impose a free-market society where the power would be spread amongst those with ideas for technological or scientific development and those able to provide diverse services or products to the population. The division of power by means of free competition was to be incentivized by the existing Government.
1.6.1.2. Con: Democratic control of resources is incompatible with centralized power in the hands of the few.
1.6.1.3. Con: Capitalism is not centralized, it's a distributed system whereby the market \(i.e people\) self-determines the value of things. Communism is the complete opposite.
1.6.2. Pro: As Communism involves the collective and democratic ownership of the economy, America is well prepared for enacting communism due to its strong democratic tradition and overall high educational levels.
1.6.2.1. Con: While uplifting as a proposal, isn't the low participation in recent electoral processes suggesting that the participation is not high enough, especially among the young voters? Furthermore since the US economy is built around private property and independent enterprise, the economy would suffer if it were deprived of its historical drivers.
1.6.2.2. Con: The United States [has roughly 1/5 students failing to graduate](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-high-school-graduation-rate-hits-new-record-high-0) high school, with distinct differences based on race and class. This suggests a citizenry not ready for communism.
1.6.2.3. Con: The tradition of great founding fathers of America is in opposition to communism. America has always been about freedom, not about being enslaved to the mythical collective.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: There is no way of knowing whether the founding fathers would have been receptive of Marxist principles. The founding fathers were also perfectly fallible human beings.
1.6.2.4. Con: Although Communism does in its rhetoric connote the social "ownership" of capital it does not always in practice involve the democratic and collective control of the means of production. Authoritarian Socialist states like the USSR and PRC have operated command economies with significant central authority and command over the economy with a "top-down" power structure.
1.6.3. Con: Communism is a system that centralizes power, whereas the U.S is decentralized \(i.e different states with local legislation\)
1.6.4. Con: Free speech is not a characteristic of the existing examples of communism.
1.6.4.1. Pro: In China, freedom of speech is greatly limited.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Media censorship is [rampant](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/communism-computing-china/censorship.html) in China.
1.6.5. Con: Only a subset of the Democratic Party \(i.e. the squad and Senator Sanders and their most ardent followers\) has the political characteristics conducive to the establishment of a communist regime. That is an extreme minority.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Bernie is considered to be [the most left-wing](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-socialist-is-bernie-sanders) candidate ever elected.
1.6.5.2. Con: Bernie identifies as a [social democrat](https://qz.com/1805692/bernie-sanders-isnt-a-democratic-socialist-he-is-a-social-democrat/) - social democrats aim to reform and regulate capitalism, not do away with it.
1.7. Pro: Communism could economically and politically strengthen the USA.
1.7.1. Con: Capitalism is a huge prompter for development, industries and companies tend to improve their products to obtain more profit, and rise above its competition; that's how the Capitalist free market has led to the current development of the USA. With a Communist government, there would be no incentive to further develop the technology; even a "State-owned Development Company" wouldn't work, as wages are the same for all jobs, and working in this company would be very time/energy consuming.
1.7.2. Pro: Because of the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, a majority of future Americans may become permanently unemployable because their labour would be worthless in the free market. To maintain a basic quality of life the government may need to create a command economy in order to adequately redistribute resources.
1.7.2.1. Con: A command economy is economically more damaging than measures such as an expanded safety net or a universal basic income.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: A social welfare state within a capitalist economy achieves the necessary objectives--caring for the needy and unemployed--with the minimum amount of intervention possible so that private industry can have the largest possible scope for setting prices etc. which is economically beneficial.
1.7.2.2. Con: A command economy is politically less viable than measures such as an expanded safety net or universal basic income.
1.7.2.3. Con: This argument ignores the so-called "[Socialist Calculation Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q8tr9pY2vY)," which concerned whether it was actually possible for a socialist economic system to do rational economic calculation. The modern scholarly consensus is that these calculations are not possible without the signals of profit and loss provided by prices in a free market.
1.7.2.4. Con: This is the same false argument presented when tractors, [ATMs](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/06/15/are-atms-stealing-jobs), and other innovations introduced. These innovations did not lead to a collapse of [society](https://ourworldindata.org/employment-in-agriculture), quite the opposite. More people could focus on careers other than farming, and bank tellers became communicably skilled salesmen for financial services. Today you can pay someone to shop for you. The limitations of the future are solved by minds of the future, not minds of the present. In short, "necessity is the mother of invention".
1.7.2.5. Pro: The pace of technical innovation will [eventually outstrip](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/automation-impact-jobs-unemployment-by-robert-skidelsky-2019-09) the rate at which a human can adapt to new conditions. Automation will eventually become faster at replacing human workers than the pace at which human workers can learn new, relevant job skills.
1.7.2.5.1. Con: There will always be a purpose for human labor because human labor will always find a way to make a contribution to the value of capital.
1.7.2.5.1.1. Pro: The human mind is innately capable of normalizing to the physical conditions of its existence and developing unique, innovative strategies for improving things and pursuing one's interests.
1.7.2.6. Pro: AI will eventually become [capable](https://hackernoon.com/artificial-intelligence-is-becoming-better-than-human-expertise-16903f4fc3c0) of making better and more efficient decisions than a free market.
1.7.2.6.1. Con: If and when AI this powerful exists, the dominant political/economic mode will be direct theocracy by a silicon god - such a regime is not communist.
1.7.2.7. Con: Greater tech-related careers, other non-labour intensive jobs and technological advancements are likely to allow more ‘unemployable’ people to be employed than ever before. With a greater aging population, [fewer](https://www.disabledperson.com/technology-pwd) labour-intensive jobs will be needed.
1.7.2.7.1. Con: This does not contradict the parent. Technological advancements may - and likely will - change the employment landscape such that some previously unemployable become employable, and some employable people become unemployable.
1.7.3. Pro: Without a powerful capitalist coalition to suppress it, it would be free to empower victims of neo-colonialism across the globe and ultimately become the dominant power on Earth.
1.7.3.1. Con: Even if a Communist USA fell into decline and became a regional power, its existence would still prove that Communism was viable in the USA, therefore this claim is irrelevant.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: A Communist USA would merely be yet another failed experiment, proving once again that Communism never works, at the cost of countless lives and untold misery.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: It is meaningful to say that an ideology is viable in a country and only mean that that ideology can come to power, not that the ideology can create the utopia it promises, this is only talking about viability in the former sense, not disputing what a Communist USA would lead to.
1.7.3.1.2. Con: Under this definition of viability, then Communism would always be viable no matter rendering the question itself pointless.
1.7.3.2. Con: Absent a complete global revolution, a scenario where a communist US is able to freely expand its sphere of influence without opposition from capitalist countries is extremely unlikely, even if we grant that communism is beneficial. Saying communism only works when unopposed is admitting that it does not work in most practical, conceivable scenarios.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Historical claims require historical context. Saying communism doesn't work based on heavily sabotaged attempts by previously post-feudal or impoverished nations is simply unscientific.
1.7.3.3. Con: This presumes a moral purity in leadership which has never been demonstrated in communist states.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Communist China is effectively exerting its power across the globe in this fashion. International land purchase by its citizens is in fact land in other countries which automatically comes under China’s control. Vietnamese people are currently protesting at China’s greater control of [Vietnamese land](https://m.theepochtimes.com/vietnamese-community-has-warning-about-communist-china_2681687.html).
1.7.4. Pro: The American [trade union movement](https://aflcio.org/about-us/history) can lead to a generation of a new class identity.
1.7.4.1. Con: Class identity is innately harmful as an unnecessary divider between haves, have-somes, and have-nots. It naturally breeds resentment by focusing on the already-volatile subject of inequality.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: Whether class identity is harmful is irrelevant to whether it may be generated.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: Capitalism has already divided the proletarian and the bourgeois in its structural make up. The proletarian works to live; the capitalist steals the worker's surplus value. The two classes have separate goals, which come into conflict with one another.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: This division only exists in the minds of people who read Marx. It is non-existent. Anyone who provides valuable services to fellow citizens has a chance at succeeding, whereas in a Communist society, the only road to success is to become a member of the inner party, which is really just 1%. Nothing else will improve your life, as any extra effort will simply lead to confiscation.
1.7.4.2. Pro: There has been a [decline](https://aflcio.org/about-us/history) in trade unions in the US since the past few decades. As a result, it would need to be regenerated into the public consciousness.
1.7.5. Con: Communism will further the wealth divide in the country.
1.7.5.1. Pro: In communist governments, the wealth divide is even greater. In communism, the government controls all of the wealth, therefore restricting the luxuries in life to the political elites. However capitalism allows its citizens to gain wealth and purchase some of those luxuries.[How Communism Divides its wealth.](https://brainly.com/question/12185705)
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Communism has caused more death and destruction: Soviet Gulags, Chinese repression than capitalism. State run economies are inherently inefficient and doomed to fail. Human nature does not respond to an economic system that doesn’t emphasize productivity.
1.7.5.2. Con: In a communist society where all property is public and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs, we can eliminate extreme wealth inequality.
1.7.5.2.1. Pro: If people all get paid according to their needs, then there won’t be people who are too rich, or too poor.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: A description of what communism aspires to is not an argument that communism is viable.
1.7.5.3. Pro: Historical examples of Communism all fail to strengthen a country economically because [central planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OQeSYgOars) by a small group of citizens cannot duplicate the collective wisdom of millions of buyers making individual self-interested financial decisions in a free market.
1.7.6. Pro: The [rise and continued growth](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/the-sharing-economy-and-how-it-changes-industries-4172234) of the communistic-like [sharing economy](https://mirunescu.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/sharing-economy-the-new-communism/) shows how it has a place in the US economically even in capitalism.
1.7.7. Con: The USA is already the strongest nation economically [measured by GDP](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/).
1.7.7.1. Pro: Free-market economics allowed the USA to reach the dominant economic position they are in now. Thus it makes little sense to switch to Communism.
1.7.7.2. Con: GDP is [only a measure of](https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/why-gdp-is-no-longer-the-most-effective-measure-of-economic-success) income, and does not take into account factors such as economic inequality and sustainability. It is thus not a good measure of economic strength.
1.8. Con: Many communist countries today use [violence and unjust arrests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/world/asia/china-ren-zhiqiang.html) to keep order, which infringes on the rights of people.
1.8.1. Pro: [Cuba is constantly committing human rights violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Cuba).
1.8.2. Pro: [Laos continues to follow this trend](https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/laos/#:~:text=Significant%20human%20rights%20issues%20included,corruption%3B%20and%20trafficking%20in%20persons.), [as does Vietnam.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VIETNAM-2019-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf)
1.8.3. Con: Strongman tactics, such as state violence & unjustified arrests, can be components of a necessary strategy for good-faith Communist leaders of undeveloped/developing countries to establish order in the midst of deeply fractured, precarious political conditions.
1.8.4. Con: Many non-communist countries today also do the same.
1.8.4.1. Con: The difference is in these nations it is okay to speak out against these actions, it is okay to protest and criticize the governments. In current communist countries [speaking out against the government leads to political imprisonment](https://freedomhouse.org/article/china-global-leader-political-prisoners).
1.8.4.2. Pro: In the US, police brutality [kills](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/the-57375-years-of-life-lost-to-police-violence/559835/) a lot of people. 1146 people were killed by the police in 2015 alone.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: This number does not take into account the times the police killed someone in self defense. It only tabulates the total number of deaths caused by the police.
1.8.4.3. Pro: People in the US are [unnecessarily arrested](https://theintercept.com/2019/01/31/arrests-policing-vera-institute-of-justice/) in large numbers for small offenses and misdemeanours
1.8.4.4. Pro: In Germany, at least [12,000](https://www.dailysabah.com/europe/2019/07/31/at-least-12000-violent-attacks-by-german-police-recorded-annually) cases of police violence occur every year.
1.8.5. Con: Communism, on the timeline, started its roots during very troublesome and challenging times. The magnitude of the chaos after [WW1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and later on the [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War) for Russia would have ripples on society for a long time. China's communist roots had [colonial powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_imperialism_in_Asia) to deal with. Events like [Opium Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars) only strengthen communism in China pushing it to even hardcore [nationalistic ideals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_nationalism) Vietnam Roots were in their [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) with the US. Such events due to public chaos "generate" unjust events for some time.
1.8.5.1. Pro: The USSR after WW2 it became [quite a different society.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00905992.2014.953467) It is natural for reasonable changes to take time in society.
1.8.6. Pro: [China has been communist for close to one hundred years now, and not only has the most political prisoners, but it is constantly treading on its peoples human rights](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/), such as but not limited to, [suppression of free speech](https://www.hrw.org/blog-feed/hong-kong-protests), [freedom of religion](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/uighurs/),[freedom of expression](https://www.cecc.gov/freedom-of-expression-in-china-a-privilege-not-a-right). It illegally occupies sovereign nations such as [Tibet](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/legal-status-tibet#:~:text=It%20is%20an%20independent%20state,sovereignty%20of%20Tibet%20to%20China.).
1.8.7. Pro: [In North Korea the citizens are forced into prison camps if they disagree with the regime](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/north-korea#).
1.9. Con: The international community is not prone to the generation of communist states.
1.9.1. Pro: While the United States is by far the strongest anti-communist actor, there would be no shortage of foreign and domestic governments willing to go to almost any length to stop a possible communist success.
1.9.2. Con: The United States was the chief prosecutor of the anti-communist agenda.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Under the Reagan Doctrine, the US has provided [aid](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/us-aid-anticommunist-rebels-reagan-doctrine-its-pitfalls) to anti-communist rebels.
1.9.2.2. Pro: With the United States on the socialist side, not only will it be able to resist the bourgeois internationally, the victims of neo-colonialism will be safe to adopt the system as well.
1.9.3. Pro: History has shown to this date that opponents of communism tend to be powerful, because they have money, and thus are capable of influencing many people to fight for them.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Political ideologies are memes \(sensu Dawkins\), which are subject to selection forces comparable to natural selection. Even if a large number of people freely chose to live in a socialist/communist manner, their society would not last long if more powerful forces acted against them.
