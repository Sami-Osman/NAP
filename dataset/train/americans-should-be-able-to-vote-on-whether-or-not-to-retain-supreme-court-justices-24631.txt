Discussion Name: Americans should be able to vote on whether or not to retain Supreme Court Justices

1. Americans should be able to vote on whether or not to retain Supreme Court Justices
1.1. Pro: This would decrease the tension over SupCo appointments.
1.1.1. Pro: Knowing that a judge will have a short term before there is an opportunity to decide whether they retain their position would reduce the stakes of the appointments and begin to reverse the modern trend of politicizing and making-partisan the appointments to the Supreme Court.
1.1.2. Con: While this may decrease the tension over individual selection hearings, the overall politicization and tension surrounding the Supreme Court could actually increase.
1.1.2.1. Pro: As well as a large percentage of tension continuing around appointments, there would now also be tension in the run-up to retention elections. Overall this would create more focus on Supreme Court makeup rather than lessening the focus.
1.2. Con: Other alternatives would better fix the issues with Supreme court nominations and appointments.
1.2.1. Pro: Some [argue](https://time.com/5338689/supreme-court-packing/) that the number of justices should be substantially increased, to reduce the 'swing vote' fears and partisanship of new appointments to the Supreme Court.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Many believe that some [increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/us/politics/supreme-court-judges-partisanship.html) of justice numbers would help with ensuring more ideological balance.
1.2.2. Pro: Using constitutional reform to allow Americans to change the constitution, as needed, to bring it in line with the dominant beliefs of the current society, would empower citizens without politicizing the office of Supreme Court justice.
1.2.3. Pro: Some argue that the Supreme Court \(in its current form\) should instead be [abolished](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/12/17950896/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-constitution).
1.3. Pro: Justices would be urged to be less controversial and the public could be held accountable for their actions.
1.3.1. Con: This could be very detrimental to the legal system. Not making any controversial decisions is not necessarily the same as upholding the law and the Constitution to the best of a judge's ability.
1.4. Pro: Supreme Court Justices already hold largely to public opinion, as seen in various cases.
1.4.1. Pro: This would encourage judges to constantly vote in a way that makes it more likely they will be popular, not according to their legal opinions.
1.5. Pro: This would improve the quality of decisions made by the Supreme Court.
1.5.1. Pro: No job should come with a lifetime guarantee. It makes it more likely that the employee will become complacent in their work.
1.6. Pro: Retention elections don't especially politicized candidates, which is an American ideal, but instead provides an opportunity to get rid of justices Americans disapprove of.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_election)
1.6.1. Con: In essence, holding a retention election does politicize the judge. They have to be 'likeable' enough to retain their seat and their judging record has to gain approval from voters in order for them to keep their job.
1.7. Con: This would be a massive constitutional shift.
1.8. Con: It's unlikely this sort of constitutional amendment would pass given the current status of Congress and the Presidency.
1.8.1. Pro: Under Trump's presidency, both [Gorsuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch) and [Kavanaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh) have been appointed to the Supreme Court. These justices are both seen by many as sympathetic \(or biased\) to Conservative viewpoints.
1.9. Con: Americans deserve a Supreme Court above the political game
1.9.1. Pro: Already, some fear that the members of the Supreme Court are overly preoccupied with maintaining their following and public popularity. Making them compete in elections would significantly increase this effect.
1.9.2. Con: The nature of the Supreme Court is already political meaning choosing not to have retention votes would not protect the court from being 'politicised'.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Many have accused the Supreme Court of failing to rise above [partisanship](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/us/politics/supreme-court-judges-partisanship.html), with their voting patterns reflecting their own biases.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Some blame the [design](https://www.vox.com/2019/9/25/20881843/supreme-court-britian-judicial-selection-brexit) of the US Supreme Court system for creating an inevitability of it becoming a political arena.
1.9.2.3. Con: Holding retention elections could significantly increase the politicization of the Supreme Court.
1.9.3. Con: Justices are not above politics, as they're almost always appointed in alignment with the President's agenda.
