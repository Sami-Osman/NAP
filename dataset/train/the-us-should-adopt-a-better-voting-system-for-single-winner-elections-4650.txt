Discussion Name: The US should adopt a better voting system (for single-winner elections)

1. Which voting system should the United States use?
1.1. Instant Runoff Voting \(aka Ranked Choice Voting, and Alternative Vote\) Shown here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) and here: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE&t=2s)
1.1.1. Pro: Votes for a losing candidate aren't wasted, as long as a winning candidate is listed on the ballot.
\(Wasted votes defined here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote)\)
1.1.1.1. Con: Lower preference votes for candidates who are eliminated in earlier rounds are wasted.  E.g., the second preference on a "2nd Place\>3rd Place\>Winner" ballot, which is never considered.
1.1.1.2. Con: Voting for a losing candidate isn't a waste.  Participatory democracy is wholly dependent on submission to majority opinion, and depends on minority losers accepting the will of the majority.  They play an essential role in the process.
1.1.2. Con: IRV favours [extremists over moderate](http://rangevoting.org/IrvExtreme.html) candidates. Additional sources: \[[1](http://leastevil.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/irv-uniquely-poor-choice-for-centrists.html)\]\[[2](https://electology.org/center-squeeze-effect)\]\[[3](https://medium.com/\@jameson.quinn/no-instant-runoff-wouldnt-solve-spoiled-elections-7f6136f1d0ee)\]
1.1.2.1. Con: The Republic of Ireland Uses ATV for it's presidential elections. And has consistently voted in nominees from parties close to the centre right and centre left, ie moderate [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland#List_of_Presidents_of_Ireland) This is real world data and should be weighted heavier than mathematical models.
1.1.2.2. Con: There is a claim that IRV favors extremists over moderates. This is only true when voters favor extremists over moderates. When that's what the voters want, it's wrong for the voting system to thwart them.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: IRV eliminates moderates even when majorities of voters prefer them over EVERY other candidate.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: IRV *CAN* eliminate a moderate even when he is everybody's second choice. However, we have no clear rule to decide when moderates ought to win.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Moderate candidates ought to win an election when the voters prefer them over every other candidate.
1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Moderate candidates ought to win when they have higher approval ratings than any other candidate.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: The reason we have "no clear rule" is that IRV \(and any ranked ballot\) destroys information about *how much* you like A over B. A voter who finds B almost as attractive as A will cast the same A\>B\>C ballot as a voter who finds B almost as awful as the worst case C.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Moderates win IRV if voters rank them high enough.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Moderates, by definition, tend to gather a modest number of first ranks and a large number of second ranks. IRV is biased against moderates because it only counts first choices.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Con: It is an esthetic choice how much information we should collect from voters about their preferences. When you collect more information than the voters have actually thought out, you are "modeling the noise".
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: The information collected can make a huge difference. In a scoring method, if everyone votes either A=5 B=4 C=3 D=0 or A=0 B=3 C=4 D=5, it is reasonable for B and C to have a chance of winning, but if they are scored 1s and 2s they are probably not worth being elected. With ranking methods, both the 3-4 and 1-2 scenarios would appear as A\>B\>C\>D and D\>C\>B\>A.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: This preference is arbitrary and, well, a preference. It could be argued that ranking methods collect all the information that matters.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: IRV does not eliminate moderates that majorities of voters VOTE for over other candidates.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: When we define "moderates" as people that do not get many first-choice votes, then IRV eliminates moderates. This is usually the right thing to do.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Eliminating candidates because they received few first-choice votes is not the right thing to do, as it can prematurely eliminate the most-liked or most-preferred candidates.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: The claim that a candidate can be the most liked and still get the fewest first-choice votes requires some particular meaning for "most liked"
1.1.2.3. Pro: With realistic distributions of voters and candidates, IRV can eliminate all the moderate candidates and elect the second most extremist. See [animation](https://imgur.com/gallery/SLTHgCO)
1.1.3. Con: The Alternative Vote leads to 2-party domination. [Theory](http://rangevoting.org/TarrIrv.html) [Example of Australia](http://scorevoting.net/AustralianPol.html) [Secondary Source](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RyiaCEb6iaIC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=Instant%2BRunoff%2BVoting%2Btwo%2Bparty%2Bdomination&source=bl&ots=FFff9A2tOE&sig=tIBmw9brpP4buhPKhOgSfiPK9_E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4h5_DvMrXAhXLWRoKHQ-vCqA4FBDoAQgnMAE#v=onepage&q=Instant%2BRunoff%2BVoting%2Btwo%2Bparty%2Bdomination&f=false)
1.1.3.1. Con: IRV lets people vote for whoever they want. With IRV voters can stop two parties from dominating simply by voting for third parties that they prefer. When the voters prefer two parties, then the two parties are supposed to win.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: FPTP also lets people vote for whomever they want, including third parties, but in both FPTP and IRV, voting for third parties can be worse than voting for the lesser evil.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: With IRV, voting for third parties is hardly ever worse than voting for the lesser evil. And you get to vote for your favorite third party, which is a plus.
1.1.4. Con: IRV incentivizes strategically voting for one frontrunner first and the other last.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Voting for a third party can cause both your third party and your backup to lose, and this situation is definitely predictable through polling.
1.1.4.2. Pro: If at least 75% of voters rank one of two candidates first, it is mathematically impossible for any other candidate to win.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: If the top two voters get more votes than all the other candidates put together, then one of them will win. This is not an argument against IRV.
1.1.4.3. Con: With IRV, when your favorite candidate is not a frontrunner you lose nothing by voting for your preferred candidate before the frontrunner. Duplicate claim [kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/with-irv-when-your-favorite-candidate-is-not-a-frontrunner-you-lose-nothing-by-voting-for-your-preferred-candidate-4650.1455)
1.1.5. Con: With IRV, if every single ballot is published, and there are many candidates \(\>=10\), it is possible for someone to buy your vote or coerce you. They would give you a specific ordering of the 10+ candidates, and check if that specific ordering was actually cast in your precinct.
1.1.5.1. Con: Also true for rating systems if ballots are published.
1.1.6. Con: IRV is not [precinct-summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.1.6.1. Con: IRV takes marginally more communication than most other voting systems. Each precinct can send the central location a list of candidates and the number of first-place votes they get. The central location then sends back the candidate that is eliminated. For N candidates, repeat this process N-1 times. So it takes N-1 times as much communication as FPTP.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: After any of those N rounds, there may be near-tie madness, as happened in Florida 2000, and it could hold up the entire count, potentially multiple times.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: This gets especially bad because with IRV, what happens in the early rounds can amplify and drastically affect the overall outcome.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Voting systems that are not precinct-summable take longer to count, often requiring all ballots be physically moved to a central location. [Approval Voting versus IRV: Precinct Summability & Delay](https://electology.org/approval-voting-versus-irv)
1.1.6.3. Pro: Voting systems that are not precinct-summable are more error-prone, since it is almost always necessary for all ballots to be physically moved to a central location for ease of counting. [Summability criterion: Importance of summability](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion#Importance_of_summability)
1.1.6.3.1. Con: There is no need to physically remove ballots for IRV.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: There is no known example of a non-precinct-summable voting system where any ballots must be physically moved. The claim this is a con for is wrong.
1.1.6.4. Con: It does not matter at all whether IRV is precinct-summable.
1.1.6.5. Con: A precinct-summable voting system will be irrelevant if an open sourced automated counting system is implemented.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Voter confidence is as important as election security. Some voters may not trust open source results which can not be verified with local paper audits
1.1.6.5.1.1. Pro: There is no way to verify that it was the actual open-source system, and not a faux version, that was actually downloaded and used.
1.1.6.5.2. Pro: Open source software lets anyone who knows how look at the code that counts the votes. They can test to see whether it works right. It does not let them see how you voted unless the software is bad.
1.1.6.5.2.1. Con: There is no way to verify that the actual open-source code, as opposed to some look-alike scam program, was downloaded and used on the machines.
1.1.6.5.3. Con: Many elections are held without electronic voting systems.
1.1.6.6. Pro: In the Burlington, VT 2009 election, there were [384 different ballot types out of 8980 voters](http://rangevoting.org/JLburl09.txt).
1.1.7. Pro: The alternate vote provides more opportunity for moderate candidates to be elected because the electorate can vote their first choice without fear of losing their vote.
1.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.7.2. Con: False: IRV does not pass favorite betrayal criterion and voting for your honest first choice can cause your preferred front-runner to be unfairly eliminated without your support for them having been registered.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: False. If you can eliminate the front-runner by voting your preferred candidate first, then the front-runner is not actually a front-runner.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: False. Suppose 46 vote Bush, 28 vote Nader, and 26 vote Gore. Gore is eliminated. If just five of the Gore voters put Bush second \(not unrealistic\), then Nader will lose.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Candidates for existing parties will be incentivized to adopt more moderate policies because they will have to compete with moderate candidates more than polar opposites.
1.1.7.4. Con: AV could lead to people voting for more extreme candidates, rather than more moderate candidates.  There is no evidence that AV necessitates "middle of the road" candidates.
1.1.7.5. Con: As your ideal favorite gets more popular it might cause your second choice to be eliminated and the election to be spoiled. Then you regret your vote and 2 party domination sets in.
1.1.7.5.1. Con: When you come in second in the first round, then definitely some third-party candidate will then be eliminated. If you come in second in the last round, then yes, none of your backup votes will count. You lose because not enough third party voters voted for you as a backup.
1.1.7.5.2. Pro: Animation of this spoiler effect here: [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/gallery/WgeOH)
1.1.8. Con: IRV is non-monotonic, meaning that increasing your support for a candidate can cause them to lose, and vice versa. This is projected to occur in [at least 15% of 3-candidate elections, increasing with the number of candidates](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-013-0118-2), based on a spatial model of voter behavior.
1.1.8.1. Pro: [IRV has a participation failure](http://rangevoting.org/Aus07.html) which means showing up to the polls can cause a voter's favourite to perform worse. This could hurt voter turnout, and is a part of why Australia had to resort to mandatory voting for its IRV elections.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: On average, voting for a candidate improves his chances. The candidate you vote for first always has his chance improved.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Yee diagrams demonstrate how off-the-rails IRV can go, with candidates winning even when the average voter is nowhere near them, etc. See [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA&feature=youtu.be&t=4m39s), [Images](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/), [Images](http://bolson.org/voting/sim_one_seat/www/spacegraph.html), [Images](http://scorevoting.net/IEVS/Pictures.html)
1.1.8.3. Pro: In Burlington Vermont in 2009, IRV resulted in electing a candidate for mayor when MORE voters marked their ballots that they preferred a different specific candidate \(the Condorcet winner\).  IRV failed on its promise to allow voters to vote sincerely without fear of electing the candidate they disliked the most.  IRV literally caused a spoiler candidate to change who the winner was.[Burlington IRV in 2009](http://rangevoting.org/Burlington.html)
1.1.9. Con: IRV is claimed to prevent spoilers. It does not always do that. If you vote your first choice and then a front-runner, maybe first the front-runner loses and then your first choice loses. The only way to stop that is to vote for the front-runner first.
1.1.9.1. Con: This is mis-use of language. If your favorite gets more votes than the front-runner, then the front-runner is not in fact a front-runner. He is a runner-up. His voters did not vote for your candidate second, as is their right. Your candidate is not a spoiler. If anything, the claimed front-runner who lost early is a spoiler.
1.1.10. Pro: IRV only requires a single round of voting.
1.1.11. Pro: The Alternative Vote allows for the expression of a greater number of viewpoints to be expressed by candidates and alternative parties as they are less tied to two main parties which define themselves on narrow issues. Currently, [third-party and independent candidates are often discouraged from running as spoilers](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/instant-runoffs-better-way-vote).
1.1.11.1. Con: Rankings preclude expression of "these are equivalent/comparable options" \(unless equal rankings are allowed\)
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: Forcing voters to choose between candidates they are indifferent between lessens the validity of their ballots.

[Maio, Roese, Seligman, Katz, 1996](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233061022_Rankings_Ratings_and_the_Measurement_of_Values_Evidence_for_the_Superior_Validity_of_Ratings)
1.1.11.1.2. Con: Condorcet methods \(at least the major ones\) have no issues with equal rankings; they require only a weak ordering.
1.1.11.2. Con: IRV's ballot evaluation only ever takes the \(current\) top preference into consideration, regardless of how expressive the ballot is as a whole.
1.1.11.2.1. Con: This is an advantage as it ensures that by ranking lower choices they do not risk harming higher ranked candidates.
1.1.11.3. Con: Ranked ballots destroy information about degree of preference.
1.1.11.3.1. Pro: Psychologists have found that ratings give better predictive validity than rankings.  

[Maio, Roese, Seligman, Katz, 1996](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233061022_Rankings_Ratings_and_the_Measurement_of_Values_Evidence_for_the_Superior_Validity_of_Ratings)
1.1.12. Pro: The "[Spoiler Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect#Mathematical_definitions)" is much less of a problem in IRV than in Plurality.
1.1.12.1. Con: Voters are often incorrectly told that IRV solves/eliminates vote splitting/spoiler effect. This is misleading and leads voters to believe the problem is solved when it isn't. When a spoiler happens anyways voters can lose faith in voting reform in general which could backfire and hurt future reforms.
1.1.12.1.1. Con: Almost every voting system fails to prevent spoilers, the same way that IRV does. When third-party voters COULD use the strengths of the system to prevent spoilers but instead bullet-vote, the system will fail.
1.1.12.1.1.1. Con: Cardinal systems \(like Approval and Score\) allow voters to support both their true favorite and their favorite frontrunner.
1.1.12.2. Pro: The US has seen an explosion of media which reduces the value of "Fame" when anyone can literally be an overnight viral video star.  Given a choice between Abraham Lincoln and John C. Breckenridge, maybe the newspapers only covered those two gentlemen. however it is clear that modern elections and modern media have a greater capacity for entrants to the field, and a higher consequence of 3rd/4th party entrants to "spoil" 1st and 2nd party candidates. \(eg: Green Party & Tea Party\)
1.1.12.2.1. Con: The claim is not that third party candidates will be less frequent but that they are less likely to damage the main candidates if the do stand.  Even if a third candidate takes a large amount of votes from one candidate in the first round this will not prevent that main candidate from being elected because voters for the third candidate will give their lower preferences to whichever main candidate they would have voted for if there had not been a third party candidate.
1.1.13. Pro: IRV could increase voter turnout.
1.1.13.1. Con: Experience indicates that IRV has minimal impact on voter turnout, except for substantially reducing the participation gap between primary voters and general-only voters [\(Kimball 2016\)](http://www.umsl.edu/~kimballd/KimballRCV.pdf).
1.1.14. Con: Ratings voting systems collect more information from voters than ranking systems \(degree of preference and indifference between candidates\).
1.1.14.1. Con: Because voters have more incentive to min-max in ratings voting systems than they do to dishonestly rank, rated voting systems can actually collect less information on average.
1.1.14.1.1. Con: Rated runoff methods provide very little incentive to min-max vote.
1.1.14.1.2. Con: Min-max strategy doesn't impact the amount of information conveyed significantly, because it's a way for voters to communicate how much they want certain candidates to win over others, regardless of honest utility.
1.1.14.1.2.1. Con: That same reasoning applies to dishonest ranking.
1.1.14.1.3. Con: Ranked voting systems can have tremendous incentive to rank dishonestly, especially Condorcet systems with burial and IRV in close 3-candidate races.
1.1.14.1.3.1. Con: The closer the election, the less the IRV voter know whether he is electing the worst candidate by choosing his lesser-evil choice first, or whether instead he elects the worst candidate by choosing his favorite first. But if enough lesser-evil voters vote his favorite second, it will work out fine.
1.1.14.2. Con: When voters don't in fact have finely tuned exact preferences, then attempting to collect more information only collects more noise with the signal.
1.1.14.3. Pro: For example, valuations of Nader 1, Gore .99, Bush 0 and Nader 1, Gore .01, Bush 0 reduce to the same ranking Nader \> Gore \> Bush, but differ significantly in score for Gore.
1.1.15. Con: It wouldn't do enough to reduce the power of the two major parties, instead just giving them cover from "spoiler" candidates from the fringes.
1.1.15.1. Pro: IRV "neuters" third parties by giving their votes to mainstream parties, making them no longer a threat to the mainstream parties, who can get their votes without making concessions to their voters.
Source: [The False Promise of Instant Runoff Voting](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2016/12/09/jason-sorens/false-promise-instant-runoff-voting)
1.1.15.2. Pro: [Simulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/7dqe0u/my_simulations_suggests_instantrunnoff_voting_irv/) indicate it wouldn't even eliminate the spoiler effect
1.1.15.2.1. Con: Even in these simulations based on unrealistic voting conditions of being the "last voter" with clairvoyance, who can make a difference with their decision, IRV voters see a 15% improvement in voting for their favorite candidate over FPTP \(79% vs 69% in these simulations\).
1.1.16. Con: The Alternative Vote has a very high ballot error rate which excludes a large portion of the electorate [Spoilage Rates](http://rangevoting.org/SPRates.html) [Secondary Source](https://fullfact.org/news/does-av-lead-more-spoiled-ballots/)
1.1.16.1. Pro: IRV's higher than FPTP spoilage rates would increase the likelihood of any given result being contested by lawsuit.
1.1.17. Con: IRV has potential for a near-tie \(widely accepted as a bad thing\) every round. The crisis-potential inherent in IRV is much larger. Every time there is a near-tie among two no-hope candidates, we have to delay until we have the exact vote totals for each before we can decide which one to eliminate.
1.1.17.1. Pro: Bush v Gore, Florida 2000, was officially decided by 537 votes, and this caused a huge lawsuit.
1.1.17.2. Pro: Elimination order matters as it affects the results of future rounds in a repeatedly amplifying manner.
1.1.17.3. Pro: Such occurrences could negate the cost savings provided by replacing primaries, and possibly delay vote certification
1.1.17.3.1. Con: This isn't entirely true especially as phrased. 

If we have viable candidates A,B,C and D and non viable candidates X and Y we can eliminate both X and Y at the same time as long as the number of supporters for X and Y combined is less than the min of A,B,C and D's number of voters.  With true no-hope candidates this will happen quite often.
1.1.17.3.1.1. Con: This is not a reliable effect.  In [San Francisco's 2004 District 5 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting_in_the_United_States#2004_results), the votes to be transferred in each of 17 passes, the not-yet exhausted votes were enough to change the result of the next round.
That type of distribution is fairly common, and may be seen in vote totals as more candidates attempt to run.
1.1.17.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.1.
1.1.17.5. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.1.
1.1.18. Con: IRV ignores a lot of information on a user's ballot. Your second and third choice may never be counted.
1.1.18.1. Con: While your first choice is winning, it is wrong to count your second choice also. One voter, one vote.
1.1.18.2. Pro: In the Burlington 2009 election, many voters voted 1st Kiss or Wright, 2nd Montroll. Montroll was eliminated, followed by Wright. But the W\>M\>K votes did not transfer to M since Montroll was eliminated already, so the second choices were not counted. Meanwhile, other people's 2nd choices *were* counted.
1.1.18.2.1. Con: Continuing, various Republicans voted for the Democrat second, and that wasn't counted because they were voting GOP. Various Progressives voted Democrat second and those weren't counted because they were voting Progressive. You count one vote at a time, and don't give one voter two votes at once. They got the right result. Some people didn't like it.
1.1.19. Pro: IRV has a long history of successful use.
1.1.19.1. Con: Except that its use has shown time and time again many problems like Spoilers and Two Party Domination. It is "tried-and-false".
1.1.19.1.1. Con: It has many successful uses, and some successful uses that partisans of other systems were dissatisfied with.
1.1.19.1.2. Pro: In Australia, in the years 2001, 2004, and 2007, the House of Representatives \(elected with IRV\) had zero third party wins out of 450. [www.rangevoting.org](http://www.rangevoting.org/AustralianPol.html)
1.1.19.1.3. Pro: In the [Burlington 2009 mayoral election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Burlington_mayoral_election), Wright was a spoiler for Montroll, and Montroll would have beat any rival in a head-to-head election \(judging by the ballots\).
1.1.19.1.3.1. Con: Montroll was a spoiler for Kiss. But then he lost and enough of his votes went to Kiss for Kiss to win.There was nothing wrong with that. That's how it should have gone.
1.1.20. Con: There are multiple instances of IRV being repealed, implying it wouldn't last as a replacement for FPTP [list](https://electology.org/irv-repealed) [expanded list](http://rangevoting.org/BackSlide.html)
1.1.20.1. Pro: When a voting reform is proposed and then repealed, it reduces momentum to adopt other reforms in the future.
1.1.20.2. Pro: The Olympics switched temporarily to [IRV in 1995](http://rangevoting.org/OlympBonaly.html) causing embarrassment and outrage, and leading to the re-adoption of Range Voting.
1.1.21. Con: Changing to AV would require electronic voting equipment where it is not already used, as well as resulting in other one-time costs
1.1.21.1. Pro: "Alternative Voting" can be explained simply \(rank preference\), but generally requires automation/computers to determine a winner.
1.1.21.2. Con: [Case studies](http://archive.fairvote.org/media/irv/actionkits/costsandsavings.pdf) have shown that it would not be significantly expensive to switch systems, nor more expensive for upkeep.
1.1.21.3. Con: Burlington, VT did not need to buy new voting machines to implement IRV, and said the cost was "negligible" and would likely save money compared to a traditional runoff. [FAQ about Burlington’s use of Instant Runoff Voting](https://web.archive.org/web/20111107210127/http://www.burlingtonvotes.org/faq/)
1.1.21.3.1. Con: The risk of near ties and the inability to precinct-sum this makes large elections cost a lot more though.
1.1.21.4. Pro: IRV would need new machines [for counting to be feasible](http://instantrunoff.blogspot.de/2008/11/instant-runoff-voting-counting-by-hand.html), resulting in that [initial cost](http://archive.fairvote.org/media/irv/actionkits/votingequipment.pdf).
1.1.21.5. Pro: According to this [report](http://electionmathematics.org/em-IRV/IRV-Cost-Considerations.pdf) of Pierce County´s \(WA\) transition to IRV and the implications of a switch to IRV for Oregon counties: 

The cost to implement IRV for Pierce County was 2 Mil usd. Many counties would need to upgrade their software and/or hardware to handle the different voting system.
1.1.21.6. Con: AV does not require electronic voting equipment in the booth; Australia uses hand-filled paper ballots.
1.1.22. Con: Some people will find it confusing
1.1.22.1. Con: This is easily solved by explaining the system very clearly at polling locations, and by teaching how the system works in school. The same way everyone learned how first past the post works.
1.1.22.2. Pro: Alternative Voting systems are more complicated than simply separating ballots into various piles and seeing which stack is bigger.  Voters are unlikely to trust "Alternative Voting" at first and will blame the system\(s\) rather than the candidate\(s\).
1.1.22.3. Pro: [Evidence shows no decline in ballot error](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/11/12/australias-rate-informal-votes-highest-decades) over time, indicating that Australia's attempts to educate voters are not sufficient to explain the complexities of the system.
1.1.23. Pro: Voters, not candidates, decide where their vote goes if a candidate loses.
1.1.23.1. Con: This only applies if the candidates are eliminated in the order you vote for them. If your 2nd and 3rd choice are eliminated before your 1st, your vote would go to your 4th choice instead, and never be able to assist 2nd and 3rd.
1.1.23.1.1. Con: It does no good at all to give votes to candidates that have already lost. When your vote goes to your fourth choice, it's because that's your best choice that can still win.
1.1.23.1.1.1. Con: Suppose you vote A\>B\>C\>D. In round 1, D comes just ahead of last-place B. The problem is that IRV completely ignores the fact that you specifically prefer B over D. In fact, B may be preferred 4:1 over D, but most of the B\>D's foolishly put A first place.
1.1.23.1.1.1.1. Con: You are voting for A, your favorite. You have no right to choose between B and D while you vote for A. That gives you two votes instead of one vote.
1.1.23.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This means you have a strong incentive to dishonestly vote B\>C\>A\>D, so that you can have a say in the B vs D contest.
1.1.23.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If you vote B\>C\>A\>D then you might find that A is eliminated when you preferred that A win. In any voting system, you can't be sure the best way to strategically vote unless you know already how everyone else is voting. This is an example of that. With IRV you have to know not only everybody else's first choice but also their second third and fourth choices. The strategy isn't worth it.
1.1.23.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Polling gives you a good idea of how voters will vote. If polls show your favorite is weak in head-to-head matches, but a compromise is strong in H2Hs, you should rank the compromise first unless your fave has no chance at all.
1.1.23.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Polling is unlikely to give you an idea how many voters who rank A fifth will rank B sixth. Without that, you may be surprised at IRV outcomes.
1.1.23.1.1.1.1.2. Con: There is no reason that a voter should not be allowed to have multiple opinions count at the same time. Score Voting and Condorcet methods, to name a few, would take into account *both* A\>B and B\>D when determining the winner.
1.1.23.1.1.1.2. Con: If you vote for A, and at the same time you also vote for B over D, you are getting more than one vote which is not fair to other voters.
1.1.23.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If all voters are getting multiple votes at the same time, or have the opportunity for such, then it is still fair and equal, because everyone's votes are still all worth the same larger value.
1.1.23.1.1.2. Con: The problem was that IRV eliminated 2nd and 3rd prematurely, even though you expressed support for them, and your vote may have been able to help 2 and 3 not lose if it were not stuck hopelessly guarding 1.
1.1.24. Con: IRV and other "majority" systems create artificial majority winners by eliminating candidates who may have had the most support.
1.1.24.1. Con: If a candidate has the most support, he will not be eliminated by IRV.
1.1.24.2. Con: IRV may behave this way, but there are Condorcet systems that create majority winners without any eliminations.
1.1.25. Con: IRV is not [Frohnmayer balanced](https://www.kialo.com/however-for-certain-classes-of-case-it-seems-intuitive-that-a-system-can-give-one-voter-more-power-than-another-examples-28219.46?path=28219.0~28219.3-28219.43-28219.46).
1.1.25.1. Con: There is no rational reason to want Frohnmayer balance.
1.1.25.1.1. Con: EQUAL VOTE -- Everyone should have the right to the same voting power as everyone else, though they may choose not to use it. [www.kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/equal-vote-everyone-should-have-the-right-to-the-same-voting-power-as-everyone-else-though-they-may-choose-not-to-use-it-28219.3?path=28219.0~28219.3)
1.1.25.1.1.1. Con: Everyone can have the same voting power as everyone else in systems that are not Frohnmayer balanced.
1.1.25.2. Con: Here is an example. FPTP is not Frohnmayer balanced with three candidates. But whenever there is a candidate who comes in last, you can vote for that candidate and then your vote cancels two others, one for each of the other candidates. There is nothing so special about requiring pairs of votes to cancel instead of triples.
1.1.25.2.1. Con: Requiring pairs to cancel ensures that vote-splitting can't affect the result. If only triples cancel, then two clone candidates with 30% of the vote each can lose to one candidate with 40% of the vote.
1.1.26. Pro: It prevents strategic voting because without knowing how everyone else votes, you can't be certain whether your second and third votes help your candidate or hurt him. So attempts at strategic voting do not work.
1.1.26.1. Con: Making your preferred frontrunner your first choice instead of your favorite candidate will reliably improve your chances of getting a good outcome.
1.1.26.1.1. Pro: Voters have already learned to do this under FPTP, so it isn't too difficult for voters to follow this strategy.
1.1.26.1.2. Con: With IRV, when your favorite candidate is not a frontrunner you lose nothing by voting for your preferred candidate before the frontrunner.
1.1.26.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.26.3. Con: The Gibbard theorem contradicts this.
1.1.26.3.1. Con: The Gibbard theorem asserts that there is a way to insincerely vote which will make it more likely that one's preferred candidate will win. The Gibbard theorem does not assert that there is any way for a voter to predict a way which will work. So it does not predict that voters in IRV systems can do strategic voting successfully.
1.2. Score followed by genuine top-two runoff.
1.2.1. Pro: Suffers none of the "cons" or uncertainties that are associated with STAR, except those that are also associated with plain Score.
1.2.2. Con: Costs more because of second polling.
1.2.2.1. Con: The cost of a badly run government can easily swamp the costs of several elections.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Score Voting and STAR Voting should elect honest and competent leaders anyway, so there may be no need to mandate extra elections.
1.2.3. Pro: Can provide time for voters to deepen their study of the most popular candidates.
1.2.4. Pro: Each of the two stages of the election inherits the democratic advantages of Score.
1.2.5. Pro: Provides some of the democratic advantages sought by the designers of STAR, because there is a top-two runoff.
1.2.5.1. Con: Score + top two runoff doesn't have the same advantages as STAR, since it consists of two separate elections: Strategic voting can be used in each stage without negative consequences in the other.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: In response to "... Strategic voting can be used in each stage....": For neither stage has the strategy usable in that stage been shown to cause any harm to the democratic aspirations of the people at large or their goal to unseat the oligarchy permanently.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: In the runoff between two candidates, the obvious strategy is honesty. This is not a harmful strategy.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: In the Score stage, no argument has suggested that Score provides a better strategy for oligarchs than it does for the people at large. For a counterexample, FPtP's strategic effects [favor oligarchy](https://rangevoting.org/Cash3.html).
1.2.6. Pro: Provides the advantages of Plurality + top-two runoff, but without the drawbacks of a Plurality first stage.
1.2.7. Con: Score+Runoff would degenerate into Score Voting because candidates would run clones and try to steal both runoff seats. This cannot backfire because Score is cloneproof.
1.2.7.1. Pro: This would turn this method into honest Score Voting.
1.2.8. Con: Turnout would be lower due to taking two days instead of one.
1.2.9. Pro: Top-two runoff has a history of use in many countries.
1.2.9.1. Con: A history of use doesn't mean that a system is good.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: For example, Plurality has been used for centuries, but it is still [regarded](http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/newsAndMedia/newsArchives/2011/04/VotingSystems.aspx) as one of the lesser voting systems.
1.2.9.2. Con: Score followed by top-two runoff is completely different from the top-two runoff used in many countries.
1.3. The Single Stochastic vote AKA [Random Ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_ballot)
1.3.1. Pro: The chance of winning is exactly proportional to the percentage of votes received.
1.3.2. Pro: It doesn't require vote counting, just a single ballot selection so it's the cheapest possible voting system.
1.3.2.1. Con: Thousands or millions of real-world ballots are too cumbersome to put in a barrel and spin it. You'd still need to count them the usual way, then generate a random number to choose the winner.
1.3.2.2. Con: The counting is cheapest, but you'd need robust mechanisms for ensuring that the single ballot was truly chosen randomly.
1.3.3. Pro: It is 100% strategy-proof, the best way to vote is for your favourite.
1.3.3.1. Pro: If your ballot is chosen, it is best to have picked your favorite candidate. If your ballot is not chosen, there is no impact on the election result.
1.3.3.2. Con: It is theoretically strategy proof, but wouldn't necessarily be so in practice.  Since the likelihood of a particular result is based on the percentage of people voting that way, some people will strategize that it's better to vote for the lesser-of-2-evil candidates from the main parties  to reduce the chance that their least-liked candidate wins.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: There are many good objections to this system, but this isn't one. 
There is 0 advantage to not picking your favorite, if you want your favorite to win. If your vote is the one chosen your favorite wins, if it isn't chosen, it has 0 impact on the race. It is strategy proof, like a mirage can't fool a blind person, it removes all the purpose of strategy by giving the results to randomness. You can improve your own odds of winning by being more people's favorite, but there is no strategic voting.
1.3.3.3. Con: This only holds among voters that can't coordinate. If a group of voters can coordinate, then they are all incentivized to vote for the candidate that maximizes utility among the group's members, even if that candidate is not the favorite of all \(or even any\) group members.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Random Ballot creates a [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) scenario. Although each voter is better off defecting, it is worse if everyone defects than if everyone cooperates.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Random Ballot does not create a Prisoner's Dilemma scenario. [Defection](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/47710/is-the-random-ballot-method-really-strategy-free/47723#47723) \(voting for your preferred candidate\) is the optimal "strategy".
1.3.3.3.2. Con: There is zero incentive to coordinate under random ballot. If your ballot gets picked, your favorite gets elected. Your ballot has no power otherwise, so there is no incentive to do anything but vote for your favorite. It is 100% strategy-proof.
1.3.3.3.2.1. Con: This is simply false. If one voter has preferences A:10 B:9 C:0 and another voter has preferences A:0 B:9 C:10, then the expected value of both voting for their favorite is 5 while the expected value of both voting for B is 9. Thus, if they can coordinate to both vote for B, they are incentivized to do so. This does not apply if they lack the ability to coordinate votes, in which case they both affect only their own vote and thus get the greatest expected value from voting for their favorite.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1. Con: This is simply false. If one voter has preferences A:10 B:9 C:0, then they have no incentive to vote for anyone other than A. If another voter has preferences A:0 B:9 C:10, then they have no incentive to vote for anyone other than C. If their ballot is selected, then their favorite gets elected. If not, then their ballot is irrelevant.
1.3.4. Con: While mathematically sensible, the mechanics of Random Ballot undercut the popular democratic ideal of personal [political efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_efficacy).
1.3.4.1. Con: Public support of and trust in Juries is much higher than in politicians indicating a higher efficacy from random selection than FPTP election [icpr.org.uk](http://www.icpr.org.uk/media/10381/Juries%20MOJ%20report.pdf)
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Multiple jurors are randomly chosen together, which allows a diversity of opinions to be represented during the trial. We don't just randomly choose a single juror to represent the public during a trial. Single-winner elections for single-seat positions \(such as president, governor, etc.\) are fundamentally different because only one person is elected.
1.3.4.2. Con: Alternatively, Random Ballot could be seen to increase the perception of personal political efficacy since each vote could be the decisive one.
1.3.5. Pro: It doesn't require party lists or other partisan-centric system.
1.3.5.1. Con: It doesn't require them, but nor does it make it likely they'll be eliminated.  Partisan-centric systems aren't required in FPTP either, but that's the way our system evolved.  If we went to stochastic tomorrow, it would be a stochastic selection from among party candidates.
1.3.6. Con: It's random, thus allowing random low support persons to win.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Many people would just write in their own name or names of friends, leading to inexperienced, unqualified winners.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Random ballot can sometimes elect unrepresentative extremists who would never be selected by any conventional voting system.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: While true, this could be largely offset by not allowing write-ins and having a sufficient hurdle to appearing on the ballot.   That is, you have to get 10K, 100K, or 1M signatures to even appear on the ballot.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: Money pays for the workers to collect signatures. So in effect, signatures may work somewhat as a proxy for money. A system that depends substantially on signatures therefore could tend toward oligarchy.
1.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Such an effect may be somewhat mitigated by willingness of people to collect signatures voluntarily.
1.3.6.2.1.1.2. Con: In the US presidential election of 2016, Jill Stein got enough signatures to be on the ballot in states totaling enough electoral votes to win, even though she is obviously not a favorite of the big-money interests.
1.3.6.2.1.2. Con: But the extremists could get lots of signatures anyway.
1.3.6.3. Con: That's not necessarily a negative.  It's possible that randomly electing representatives would produce better representatives than our current system.
1.3.7. Pro: Election competitiveness is one of [the biggest factor](http://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=wwu_honors)s affecting voter turnout. Random ballot ensures every candidate has a chance of winning, and every vote has an equal chance of deciding the election which should dramatically improve turnout.
1.3.8. Con: Random ballot winners are only representative when averaged over many elections, but political attitudes change on a much shorter time-scale.
1.3.8.1. Con: The rate of change of underlying political preference is irrelevant. I.e. random sampling from highly stochastic functions is equally representative as random sampling from smooth, deterministic functions. [Demonstration](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/cnnr.mccrmck/Published/SingleStochasticVote.nb)
1.3.9. Con: There is the possibility of the government making it a black box, where no one knows how many voted for a representative, and whether or not the person elected actually represents the people.
1.3.9.1. Con: That's possible with any voting system. There's plenty of complaints of rigged elections with the current system.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: With other systems the raw number results have to be presented to the public to stave off claims of vote rigging. Under this system, however, only one ballot is picked, thus the government is unable to prove the sanctity/legitimacy of the process.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Con: Under any voting system the raw numbers of votes could be lied about by the entity counting the votes.
1.3.10. Con: If used to only elect 1 representative, there is a significant probability that the representative would not reflect the will of the supermajority \(\>75%\).
1.3.11. Con: Single Stochastic Voting may result in many citizens merely voting for themselves rather than seeking a societal optima.
1.3.12. Pro: Sometimes the results will be hilarious, and the world needs more mirth.
1.3.13. Con: Random ballot is no more expressive than FPTP.
1.3.13.1. Con: If your goal is to improve the quality of candidates elected \(be "expressive"\), FPTP voting is not a good system to achieve that outcome.
1.3.13.2. Con: Random ballot is much less expressive than most other voting methods.
1.3.13.3. Con: Your opinions about candidates other than your favorite are irrelevant under Random Ballot. There is no reason to be "expressive".
1.3.13.3.1. Con: The amount of information that a voting method collects and uses affects how good its results will be.
1.3.13.3.1.1. Pro: If you limit voters to only expressing their favorite, your voting method will not be able to identify strong compromise candidates that maximize satisfaction but aren't anyone's favorite.
1.4. 3-slot Condorcet//Top-Rated + runoff: Candidates rated as Top, Compromise, disapproved, equal ratings allowed, rank preference inferred from rating. Round 1 winner = beats-all winner or top-rated winner. If R1W lacks majority approval, 2nd round against candidate most approved on ballots not approving R1W, plus Smith Set and total approval winner, or any candidate tied for beats-all // top-rated
1.4.1. Con: The rules seem arbitrary
1.5. 3-2-1 voting.
Described here: [wiki.electorama.com](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/3-2-1_voting)
1.5.1. Con: This method is more complicated than Approval Voting, which makes it spread slower and create more fear among people who don't fully understand its implications for them and how much it will cost to use/repeal.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The more complex and different from the status quo something is, the less likely it is to get support.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Complex ideas are more likely to receive [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt) and paralysis, due to the greater amount of time and effort required to understand them and their implications.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: This makes it easier for charlatans to advocate against reform, while making voters uneasy/resistant to better voting methods.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Creating minority opposition to a reform that was initially minority-supported will cancel out or reduce the benefits of [renormalization](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15), as the majority will no longer be clearly pulled in any direction.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The more there is an appearance of strong support or neutrality towards reform, rather than support versus opposition, the faster that reform spreads and is accepted.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: All else equal, a more popularly used and observable method beats a less-used method; this is one of the cruxes of why people and organizations [resisted](https://www.registerguard.com/opinion/20181012/vote-no-on-measure-20-290---star-voting) STAR Voting in Lane County.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Check out FairVote's [fallacious critiques](https://www.fairvote.org/explaining_fairvote_s_position_on_star_voting) of STAR Voting, largely powered by its misunderstanding of the additional Runoff step, as an example of how complexity increases error propagation and the energy/time/burnout required to fight those errors/misunderstandings. It's an opportunity cost.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is better to spend limited resources convincing everyone your reform is decent, but better, rather than convincing half of them it's great and trying to dissuade the other half from naive criticisms that fool them into thinking the reform is bad/unnecessary/expensive.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: FairVote has been making [fallacious](http://archive3.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/blog/why-approval-voting-is-unworkable-in-contested-elections/) [critiques](https://www.fairvote.org/how_is_rcv_better_than_approval_score_or_condorcet_voting_methods) of approval voting for longer than STAR voting has existed. Approval's simplicity has not decreased error propagation or reduced the amount of resources required to fight those errors.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Approval Voting has not received significant resources or advocacy before The Center for Election Science began in earnest, as there was no money to fund any campaigns for it. A theoretical reform, bound mostly to student and organizational elections, receives far less attention/desire from people who want to understand its true quality, than one that is viable and actually advocated for reform. So the true measure of Approval Voting beating error propagation starts after Fargo \(2018\).
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is harder to defend a reform that nobody is advocating for.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: No serious resources were put into defending Approval Voting before the last few years \(pre-2019\), only Range Voting, and that method is more complex than Approval Voting.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Approval Voting has received several articles defending it against IRV advocates and FairVote over several years.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: But those articles were backing up a theoretical reform, one that, for a large period of time, was not advocated \(as a top priority over other systems by any significant organizations, anyways\) for public elections.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: One of FairVote's critiques of Approval Voting \(fails majority rule\) applies even more harshly to scored methods, because they allow a minority to beat a majority in a one-on-one contest.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: This is not true for rated runoff methods. The runoff step ensures these methods pass the Condorcet loser criterion and thus the majority loser criterion as well.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Rated runoff methods are longer and harder to explain, with more functional steps and philosophical contradictions, and therefore Approval should be prioritized for casual conversation, advocacy, explanation, demonstration, and spread of "best practices" of voting reform.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Scored methods mitigate one of FairVote's critiques \(fails later-no-harm\), as they allow honest voters to indicate some support for secondary preferences without completely disrupting their favorite's chances of winning.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: This mitigation will be rather marginal in the public's eyes, as FairVote will simply claim that any scored method will strategically devolve into Approval, and Approval will have the same flaws as before.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con: STAR Voting can more plausibly break this tradeoff, as it is harder to argue that a voter will not give at least a 1 to their secondary preferences, allowing them some voice in the runoff.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2. Con: [Empirical evidence](https://rangevoting.org/HonestyExec.html) that scored methods induce greater honesty can be used against FairVote's claims that all voters will be strategic.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: If voters buy the empirical evidence that Score will induce honesty, they will almost certainly have an even easier time believing the empirical evidence that Approval doesn't [actually reduce to bullet voting.](https://rangevoting.org/BulletBugaboo.html)
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: It is easier for a rational voter to see how scoring will lead to/induce honesty, rather than to understand whether or not voters will bullet vote in Approval, which is an almost inherently strategic method due to the approval threshold.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Not all voters are rational, or will be able to analyze the evidence in a rational, thorough manner.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: If voters don't think rationally or thoroughly, they may be more likely to simply break towards the simpler reform.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a strong assumption, and an analysis not worth building a reform movement upon.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The ["tyranny of the fluent"](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-prefer-simple-answers-and-solutions-to-problems-that-are-obviously-complex) means that when something is simple and "feels" like it could be true, people tend to give it more of the benefit of the doubt than something they inherently need to think harder on.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Score and STAR Voting are not much harder to think about, either in concept, implementation, or use, than Approval Voting.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In terms of implementation, it is harder for a voter who is simply thinking about it on their own to see why Score is almost as implementable with current voting machines or vote-counting procedures as Approval, which is more conceptually and visually similar to FPTP.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: In terms of use, Score and STAR Voting require far more thought on how voters may use the intermediate range of the scale, as well as what happens when different mixtures of voters behave differently in terms of strategy or honesty. They may come out on top in simulations, but this is not an inherently intuitive idea for many, and some will even reason it the opposite way.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: All of this contributes to increased resource usage to counter voters' misunderstandings or criticisms on the reform.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: In terms of concept, Score and STAR more explicitly require the voter to reason on utilitarianism and the nature of utility, and how cardinal numbers express that. This is an entirely new moral and political philosophy and set of concepts for many. Compare that to Approval, where utilitarianism is only present when a\) the majority splits the vote between multiple candidates, letting the minority win \(as familiar in FPTP\) or b\) a more-than-majority-approved candidate beats a majority favorite.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The fact that Approval doesn't allow for nuanced support of multiple candidates means that Score and STAR beat it in the public's eyes on the example of the majority splitting its votes, as the majority can at least give some support to each of its favored candidates. This confronts the issue of the Burr dilemma and later-no-harm, which are the major critiques by FairVote.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5. Con: [Strong](https://www.electionscience.org/library/approval-voting-versus-irv/) [retorts](https://www.electionscience.org/library/bullet-voting/) by the Center of Election Science to FairVote have been made easier, shorter, and stronger, not worse, by Approval Voting's simplicity and conceptual and philosophical similarity to FPTP.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: A method that involves a vote or no vote is easier to understand and visualize than a fractional vote method \(scored methods\)
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Voters lack a functional and philosophical understanding and grounding in utilitarianism which allows them to process how it would realistically affect politics, and how it might backfire.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: This uncertainty only increases when you allow votes to be fractional \(scores\), therefore it should be avoided.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: A voter thinking of adopting a voting reform may prefer utilitarianism upon first hearing of it \("this will stop those liberals from taxing me"\) \("the conservatives will start paying for my welfare"\)
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: This uncertainty increases when voters are pondering an idea abstractly, meaning they're not in a position of power to adopt it, and quickly, because they don't think it's important at first.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Even if you convince one person to support utilitarianism, it is quite tough for the philosophy to spread, as it is somewhat awkward to push it for political elections in abstract, short conversations. \("we should maximize happiness in society and politics"\) \("through politics?!"\)
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Utilitarianism can spread in contexts where people can easily visualize and connect it to political consequences, for themselves and their listeners.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Utilitarianism also spreads faster among the political minority of an area, and go some extent the majoritarian moderates, as they benefit most \(usually\) from utilitarian politics.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.2. Con: Many people already believe in utilitarianism in other areas of their life \(getting pizza with friends\)
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Most people have given up on politics due to bloodiness, so utilitarianism sounds naive and idealistic, without strong explanations that they're often unwilling to focus on in casual conversation or demonstration.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: It takes longer, is harder, and inspires less confidence in listeners who then try to spread the word, to explain why minorities should beat majorities in scored methods, than to explain only why \(in most cases, particularly the common ones a person is most likely to think of and focus on\) bigger majorities should beat smaller majorities in Approval.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.3.1.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4. Pro: Most voters are unaware that two-party domination is unnatural, that they have utility distributions that are linear, transitive, and overlap with others, or that utilitarianism is superior to Condorcet/preference without absolute degree. Therefore, they will fail to understand or misunderstand the application of utility to politics.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: Most voters only vaguely know of "centrism", which is their closest analogue, both in terms of conceptual similarity and their amount of knowledge, experience, and certainty with it, to utilitarianism, and many oppose that due to the twisting of the term, and its failure to generate stabler, better politics \(in a system designed to discourage it and make it fail due to lack of proper information-collection via scoring, but they don't see or understand that\)
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Everyone knows the current system isn't designed for compromise, and is bloody.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Some believe this is the most compromise possible of any system, and disregard immediately as naive attempts to show the underlying reality of how utilitarian ideals can unite and reveal the similarities of the public, while leading to better outcomes.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: People already often feel Approval yields "the least disliked" \(bland/incompetent\) winners rather than most liked/competent. Scored methods only exaggerate this feeling, and seem at first almost designed to foolishly pursue this "naive" ideal.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Thr anti-utilitarian ideal is reversed when voters are considering adopting the system, as many will look for every incremental bit of mercy they can while thinking on politics and voting.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Scoring is unfamiliar to politics, therefore it feels like more of a naive nerd's invention than Approval.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Scoring feels more untested/risky than approving in politics, which still only involves voting or not voting.
1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.2.1.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: The more complex an idea, the less likely it is to receive informal implementation, which boosts support in and of itself, and gives users an even deeper understanding of the method without having to research it.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: It also increases trust, as one can point to any number of major and important organizations and feel confident the method must work well and is trustworthy.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Approval Voting's simplicity may have made it easier to repeal at several organizations, such as Dartmouth and IEEE, which in turn can be used by critics to show that the method doesn't work.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Having several successes but several repeals may reflect more poorly on a method than a few successes but no repeals.
1.5.1.2. Con: This method has found far greater support among voting theorists than Approval Voting.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Support among the informed doesn't always translate into support among the uninformed/resistant/paranoid.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: The paranoid can't be gotten by any reform, because they're paranoid.
1.5.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Some paranoias are more prominent than others \(i.e. concerns about majority rule violation may be more common than concerns about utilitarian violation\)
1.5.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Voting theorists and advocates' support translates into greater action, all else equal.
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: Voting theorists are the ones who spend time connecting the ideas to reality, so they are better equipped to manage campaigns and think about advertising to different levels of society than voters.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: A voting method that is less easily understood is less democratic, and has less legitimacy in the eyes of the people, who may then feel the method has little or no benefit for them, and is instead an academic exercise or otherwise meant to appease other political interests, rather than them.
1.5.1.2.4. Con: This is an appeal to authority, based on the opinion that the opinions of voting theorists have some sort of validity.
1.5.1.2.4.1. Con: That is not a fallacy. Voting theorists are exactly those who would have the most experience and credibility regarding voting systems.
1.5.1.3. Pro: The simpler and easier to understand an idea is \(so long as it's an actual improvement\), the less energy and cost to explain required to spread it.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: Things that are cheaper and take less energy to spread get a disproportionate boost, as many will jump on to an easy opportunity for reform but a significant proportion will be dissuaded by a slightly harder campaign, and so on.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: Taleb's [minority rule](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15) states that a statistically well-distributed minority that strongly pursues its ideas will win if the majority does not lose much utility by going with them. Simpler ideas that can more easily be evaluated, and that can easily be seen to have decent worst-case scenarios will generate less backlash from majorities, and will spread faster.
1.5.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: Good things, when spread at large, have unexpectedly and nonlinearly [large benefits](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility) compared to when only a few know of them.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The article also mentions that small trials of many things, decentralization, and spreading out risk works better to find a "jackpot-winning option" than focusing largely on one thing.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Focusing on multiple options to some extent may be better for multiple decentralized ballot measure campaigns.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Allowing various ballot measure campaigns to arise through the action of voters and advocates deciding for themselves which methods they prefer, while having a common, basic starting point or philosophy and common set of tenets and moral philosophies, is more democratic and superior in quality \(in terms of improved chances of success and survival\) than trying to consolidate power behind one campaign for one idea, which can succeed or fail and kill the entire movement.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Approval Voting's success itself, ironically, may be a result of it being included among many other options when discussed in both theory, reform advocacy, and logistical implementation groups, and "hitting the jackpot."
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Focusing on one option is more appropriate for explanation purposes at scale, whereas explaining multiple options to a small random sample might help pick the one best option for large-scale advocacy.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Voters themselves are decentralized units, and the more of them that know, like or use an idea, the more unexpected good things will happen to boost that idea i.e. a Chinese ambassador observes children approval voting on a playground, or an advocate hears of an idea from a local business contact, etc.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: This supports the idea that voters should be educated largely about one voting method or philosophy, to preserve the benefits of scaling an operation, and because the simplicity of the one method, combined with the freedom of each voter, means that voters are free to research and learn about new voting methods or philosophies and advocate for their implementation.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Decentralization allows those who care to focus on what matters to them, rather than working together on a reform nobody likes, cares about, or feels is good enough to merit attention or effort.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Decentralization allows the passionate to prove their systems, offering benefits whether they succeed or fail.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If a voting reform campaign fails, it hurts the movement at large.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1.2. Con: There may be a waste of resources in pushing for a bad system.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: It is unlikely significant resources will be wasted, as most of those who contributed would've only done so if they thought the reform was good, or had a chance.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: More effort and success can be reaped from the passion of decentralization in the long run than from centralization.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.4. Con: There is a limitation on the plausible, reasonable number of options to trial for voting reform, as it appears simple cardinal methods have the advantage theoretically over other systems for reform purposes.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.4.1. Con: There are an endless number of scales and variations to be tried out on cardinal systems \([Majority Denominator](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/af6kc5/comment/edwb2j0), 0-10 vs 0-5, Optional Delegation, etc\)
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.4.2. Con: Nobody has done a ballot measure campaign for Condorcet systems, so a few on that to prove the system's chances of passing or spreading may help.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.
1.5.1.4. Pro: In the current world, which is falling apart, reform must come quickly. For that reason, even a good reform that is more likely to get passed quickly is better than a great reform that will take longer/have a higher chance of failing, as the complexity of the world increases the chances that everything collapses, necessitating [urgent changes](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/climateletter.pdf) even [at the cost](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pp2) of long-run benefits.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: The same way doubling your money at a casino with a 1% chance of going bankrupt isn't worth it if you go back too many times, the chance of getting more long-run benefit for society isn't worth it if it carries a higher chance of not happening, or not happening quickly enough, as the world could collapse in the meantime.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Climate change, financial crashes, and political warmongering are only some reasons why voting reform must happen quickly, even if it's not perfect - otherwise, the risk of something or other going catastrophically wrong and affecting the whole world goes up. Therefore, a voting system that is more likely to pass or spread faster is superior to a better, but less viable system.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Approval Voting would elect politicians who better reflect public opinion, and such politicians would be more likely to solve major systemic problems like climate change than current politicians.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are several [existential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/existential-risk/) that can destroy the world if not tackled soon.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Voters don't want to spend [significant amounts](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/do-most-americans-believe-climate-change-polls-say-yes/580957/) to combat climate change, so it's unlikely that better politicians will be able to do much to combat climate change.
1.5.1.5. Pro: Even if this method succeeds, people will have a harder time linking the success to the method itself, as they don't understand all the implications of how the method was supposed to succeed.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: Even if they don't understand why the method should've succeeded, they may be more likely to take on faith the reasons that proponents advocate if they see a large amount or quality of success, especially if it happens to people like them or near them, or people that they understand or are interested in \(i.e. New York City or a major place of interest\)
1.5.1.5.1.1. Con: Approval Voting will benefit more from this effect than complex methods, especially in the early years, as it has been suggested for iconic places like Fargo and St. Louis, Missouri \(and likely only was proposed in these places due to its simplicity and similarity to the status quo\), whereas other methods are proposed in places like Lane County, Oregon \(obscure\), and which thus receive less proportional fame, credit, and awe for passing the method.
1.5.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The "fame factor" of having major cities supporting a method can't be understated in having a disproportionate effect in giving legitimacy and a desire to experiment with new ideas \(i.e. major cities tend to be seen as places that only implement "best practices", and they are only likely to have hooked onto an idea in the first place if the diverse populations within them were able to unite around them, or analyze some useful quality in them that was beneficial for unity or civic improvement\)
1.5.1.6. Con: The complexity of the system may make the idea spread slower, but the increased quality, and the fact that voters evaluating a ballot measure tend to give it rational thought, mean that this system may win more often and bigger in ballot measures than Approval Voting.
1.5.1.6.1. Con: Spreading an idea is more important, to some extent, than winning big and often, because the more people that know the idea and its importance, the more action that is generated across the world.
1.5.1.6.1.1. Con: An increased chance of winning is more important than spreading the idea, as it is those who pass a ballot measure, not the voters, who count when it comes to reforming a system that itself doesn't represent the voters. Pushing for reforms that appeal more to reformers than voters may, in practice, lead to more reform, even though fewer understand the idea and its implications.
1.5.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: The improvement from reform matters more than the fact that voters are aware/in support of it; nobody realizes that FPTP is bad, but it is still affecting everyone.
1.5.1.6.1.2. Pro: The more that people understand the idea, and the easier it is to implement, even in informal contexts \(i.e. Approval Voting is raising your hand more than once in a vote\), the more that idea will spread, which is beneficial to getting even the politically unengaged and the apathetic to see and push for the superiority of the practice.
1.5.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Increasing the "energy" behind reform is important, because it makes people excited, and increases the connections between average people, an important aspect of reform, because it creates "latent pools of support" which can be activated cheaper when the time comes to pass the idea as a ballot measure.
1.5.1.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.
1.5.1.6.2. Pro: STAR Voting [narrowly lost](https://ballotpedia.org/Lane_County,_Oregon,_Measure_20-290,_Score_Then_Automatic_Runoff_Voting_Method_\(November_2018\)) in Lane County, yet there are several factors that worked against it that make it likely that it would've approximated or beaten Approval's performance in Fargo, meaning that it serves as narrow evidence that scored methods may outperform or equal Approval Voting on ballot measure victories.
1.5.1.6.2.1. Pro: The STAR Voting campaign spent half as much money on each voter as the Fargo campaign.
1.5.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Considering how narrow the margin is, it would not be surprising if STAR's defeat was actually the result of this factor alone.
1.5.1.6.2.2. Pro: The Lane County campaign had to work with a far more geographically and politically diverse area \(urban areas + rural areas\), whereas Fargo's campaign was concentrated in an urban area.
1.5.1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Concentrating on an urban area, which tends to have liberal politics, likely benefited Fargo, as there is some evidence that the Lane County campaign was hurt by overly liberal-looking marketing and signage in rural areas, a byproduct of appealing to two different communities.
1.5.1.6.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.6.2.1.1.
1.5.1.6.2.3. Pro: STAR Voting is a brand-new reform with little previous research or experimentation, while Approval Voting has been used for at least 40 years, and has historical usage going back hundreds of years. This suggests that voters believed in STAR despite its lack of usage, so they may have latched onto its quality more than Approval.
1.5.1.6.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.6.2.1.1.
1.5.1.6.2.4. Con: Approval Voting's 63% win in Fargo is real. The 48% defeat for STAR may or may not portend good results in the future for STAR, but it is inappropriate to extrapolate that off of limited data and \(most likely\) biased and inaccurate reporting from the campaign, because they were in favor of STAR.
1.5.1.6.2.5. Pro: Several voters who supported STAR reported anxiety after the election that they were unable to find STAR Voting on their ballots - raising questions as to whether the ballot design confused or misled voters into voting against a proposal that a majority of them actually liked.
1.5.1.6.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.6.2.1.1.
1.5.1.6.2.6. Con: STAR Voting, because of its inherent complexity, may be less likely to win big than Approval Voting, because it is a smarter strategy to focus on a majority of the easiest voters than to try to persuade the confused/misunderstanding/anti-reform partisan minority.
1.5.1.6.2.6.1. Con: Winning big isn't as important as winning.
1.5.1.6.2.6.1.1. Con: Winning big produces more support for a reform in other jurisdictions where it is not yet in consideration, and helps that reform beat out other similar reforms, or ones that people feel may be superior but have less momentum/are less likely to gather momentum in the future.
1.5.1.6.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: Because IRV/Ranked Choice Voting is winning big, and it is a very small improvement over FPTP, producing the biggest wins possible for other methods is a very important factor in beating not only FPTP but IRV in the future, so that reform actually produces good results.
1.5.1.6.2.6.1.1.2. Con: It is important to think of reform not in terms of "beating" other reforms, as this is counterproductive and helps opponents of all reforms.
1.5.1.6.2.6.1.1.2.1. Con: This is true to some extent, but producing consensus and strong preference for one or related reforms is better than having disunity, as voters who don't pay attention can't briefly summarize what to go with or why, to themselves and to others.
1.5.1.6.2.6.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: If a voter is unable or unwilling to strongly or quickly explain a voting method or its philosophy to others, that method won't spread as fast as one where voters are able or willing.
1.5.1.6.2.6.2. Con: It is not guaranteed that Approval Voting's simplicity will not generate a body of angry/confused voters who tamp down its margins, because they don't like that it's a marginal improvement/it's not the reform they truly wanted.
1.5.1.6.2.6.2.1. Con: It seems marginally more likely that Approval's simplicity and status as a first step to reform will produce better results than scored methods' complexity and improved quality.
1.5.1.6.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: It may be easier to convince voters to take a first step, rather than to go with a final solution, because many of them have not/will not make the link between FPTP and all societal problems, so they will have a harder time believing that reform should be trusted/given so much credit in society in the first place.
1.5.1.6.2.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: By voting "yes" for a more complex method, voters who feel that reform is starting to overtake their higher, more-likely-to-produce-actual-results \(in their unthorough opinion\) may fear that they will get worse results for their actually favored policies/reforms. This may be part of why IRV \(Alternative Vote in the UK\) [failed so badly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum).
1.5.1.6.2.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: A method that actually has quality can prove to voters that it should take priority over their other favored political ideas.
1.5.1.6.2.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Even if voters feel that a voting reform shouldn't take priority, supporters of more complex systems can convince voters that voting reform will not be a significant spending of their "political capital" on issues they care more about.
1.5.1.7. Pro: Politicians may not understand its implications either, making it less likely that they will be able to repeal or outlaw the idea by the time it reduces their power.
1.5.1.7.1. Pro: A proliferation of many voting methods, each with their confusing terminology and not, on the surface, easy to philosophically connect \(i.e. all cardinal methods are about utilitarianism, all ranked methods are about majority rule\) will make it harder for politicians to connect the dots before it's too late for them.
1.5.1.7.1.1. Pro: Ranked choice voting, with its tendency towards two-party domination \(due to its dependence on ideas of majority rule that conflict with being able to vote for your favorite\), may seem similar to other voting methods politicians are less familiar with, giving other methods a sense of innocuousness that will prove deadly for the two-party system.
1.5.1.7.2. Con: This argument type is flawed, because once politicians are elected under a new system, they will be biased towards that system that got them in power.
1.5.2. Con: 3-2-1 Voting is not party-agnostic.

[3-2-1 voting: rules for the third semifinalist](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/3-2-1_voting#Footnote_.C2.B2:_rules_for_the_third_semifinalist)
1.5.2.1. Con: There are ways to make 3-2-1 voting party-agnostic, such as using a proportional approval system on the "Good" ratings to pick the top 3 candidates.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: This ruins the simplicity of explaining and implementing the voting method.
1.5.3. Pro: 3-2-1 is [precinct-summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.5.4. Pro: 3-2-1 is [monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion).
1.5.5. Pro: Ties are highly unlikely.
1.5.5.1. Con: Ties are actually more likely than under Approval since there are two Approval like stages. \(The 3rd and 4th Goodest candidates could be tied or the 2nd and 3rd most Bad could be tied. If half-good and half-bad are added this is less problematic.
1.5.6. Pro: 3-2-1 mostly satisfies the [later-no-harm criterion](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Later-no-harm_criterion).
\(Steps 1 and 3 satisfy it\)
1.5.7. Pro: In simulations, 3-2-1 voting's worst-case [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html) is 92%, which is better than the worst-case of any other system, and better than the best-case of IRV, Majority Judgment, and Plurality.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Worst case plausible VSE is even higher, at 94.2; it is incredibly unlikely that strategic voting would be limited to only one faction.
1.5.8. Con: The handling of blank ratings would likely confuse people.
1.5.8.1. Con: A blank score can be equivalent to an OK rating, making the treatment of blanks simpler and more understandable. This does not change the core of the system.
1.5.9. Con: In 3-candidate elections, there is a chance of two party domination if nearly all voters vote the dem as Good and the gop as Bad, or vice versa. This is not a problem in 4+ candidate elections or if the less favored major party somehow ends up a finalist.
1.5.9.1. Con: In a 3-candidate election \(assuming D/R/I\), in this scenario either the Dem or Repub candidate would be eliminated in the 2nd step \(most bad votes\) and then the Indep candidate would be one of the finalists, breaking the two party gridlock.
1.5.10. Pro: Step 1 incentivizes candidates to generate enthusiasm among core supporters rather than being inoffensive and non-committal.
1.5.11. Pro: Steps 2 and 3 incentivize candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters once they have core supporters.
1.5.12. Pro: 3-2-1 voting eliminates the [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect).
1.5.12.1. Con: But it does suffer from the teaming effect, where cloning a candidate can only help them.
1.5.12.1.1. Con: There are [rules for the third semifinalist](https://electowiki.org/wiki/3-2-1_voting#Footnote_.C2.B2:_rules_for_the_third_semifinalist) that prevent this problem.
1.5.13. Pro: 3-2-1 is extremely resistant to [tactical voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting).
1.5.13.1. Pro: In simulations, tactical voting only reduces [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html) by 3 percentage points.
1.5.13.2. Pro: In simulations, tactical voting backfires [nearly twice as often](http://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/stratstuff.html) as it succeeds.
1.5.14. Pro: 3-2-1 [can be tallied with plurality, approval, score, and other point voting methods](https://electowiki.org/wiki/3-2-1_voting#For_US_presidential_elections).
1.5.15. Con: The rules for tallying ballots are fairly complex and make 3-2-1 voting difficult to fully explain.
1.5.15.1. Con: Not really. Take the 3 with the most Goods, then of those eliminate the one with the most Bads, and of the last two elect the one most people prefer over the other.
1.5.15.1.1. Con: This is only a partial explanation. It does not cover [blank ratings](https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/3-2-1_voting#Footnote_.C2.B9:_Blank_ratings), [rules for the third semifinalist](https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/3-2-1_voting#Footnote_.C2.B2:_rules_for_the_third_semifinalist), or [tiebreakers](https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/3-2-1_voting#Tiebreaker).
1.5.15.1.1.1. Con: Those links only go to one version of the 3-2-1 rules. A slightly different version may treat blanks and ties differently.
1.5.15.2. Pro: 3-2-1 voting is hard to envision mentally in its overall dynamics, even for a person who understands the rules \(ballot and tally\). This is analogous to how knowing the rules of chess does not suffice to make one a good chess player.
1.5.15.2.1. Con: The basics are quite simple: take the three candidates with the most Good ratings, keep the two with the least Bad ratings, and elect the one preferred by a majority.
1.5.15.2.1.1. Con: Simplicity of the basics does not imply simplicity to analyze their consequences or the strategies for playing the game.
1.5.15.2.2. Con: While envisioning anything beyond the basics may be difficult, insofar as this renders tactical voting impractical it is actually an advantage.
1.5.15.2.3. Pro: Difficulty of understanding the dynamics makes it hard to determine whether some as yet undiscovered strategy lurks in the system, a strategy that would help the money-supported candidates at the expense of the others once it is discovered.
1.5.15.2.3.1. Con: This is true of all systems, unless they are so simple we can be sure we have considered all the possibilities. The more complicated the system, the more certainly there is a hidden flaw that has not been noticed yet.
1.5.16. Con: Under the core rules a party can run 3 clones \(hoping they all get into the semifinals\) and eventually you just get Approval Voting.
1.5.17. Con: 3-2-1 fails Frohnmayer balance.
1.6. Approval-IRV: Like [IRV](https://www.kialo.com/alternative-vote-aka-ranked-choice-voting-and-instant-runoff-voting--shown-here--enwikipediaorg-and-here-youtubecom-4650.1?path=4650.0~4650.1), but voters can give multiple votes on the same rank, which are each counted fully \(like Approval\). Later tiers are only counted if all candidates from all higher tiers are eliminated.
1.6.1. Pro: Allows supporters of Approval or IRV to vote as in their preferred system.
1.6.2. Con: Approval-IRV is not [precinct-summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.6.3. Con: With Approval-IRV, a voter who approves of a major party candidate will likely never have their lower tiers counted.
1.7. Approval voting. Vote for one or more. Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)
1.7.1. Con: Approval voting is inexpressive because you can only approve or disapprove of any particular candidate.  Ranking and rating systems collect more detailed information from voters.
1.7.1.1. Pro: The inability to otherwise differentiate between approved candidate\(s\) and favorite candidate may contribute to [bullet voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_voting).
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Almost every voting system can degenerate to bullet voting.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: FairVote's research shows that [32% of voters bullet vote under RCV](https://www.fairvote.org/rate_of_bullet_voting_depends_on_candidate_strength_party_cues_and_other_factors)
1.7.1.1.2. Con: In St Louis Approval Voting elections, [voters expressed 1.1 to 1.6 approvals per ballot, in races with more than two candidates](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/board-election-commissioners/documents/election-results/upload/Mar21-Final-Official-Summary.pdf).
1.7.1.1.3. Con: In Fargo's 2022 mayoral election, [voters expressed 1.6 approvals per ballot](https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/fargos-second-approval-voting-election-runs-smoothly/).
1.7.1.1.4. Con: In a situation where there are a large number of candidates and most voters are bullet voting the non bullet voting voters have ballot power equal to approximately \(number of viable candidates / 2\) relative to the bullet voters. Voters will be quickly trained against bullet voting.
1.7.1.1.4.1. Con: Voters will tend to bullet-vote when they care more that their favorite win than care that their least-approved loses.
1.7.1.1.5. Pro: In an Independent Party of Oregon preference poll, 70% of voters cast bullet votes. [www.fairvote.org](http://www.fairvote.org/new_lessons_from_problems_with_approval_voting_in_practice) [archive.is](https://archive.is/Ugekh)
1.7.1.1.6. Con: [In elections conducted by the German Pirate Party](http://web.archive.org/web/20190219005345/https://sites.google.com/a/electology.org/www/pirate-elections-germany), average approvals per ballot were as high as 3.07, and typically around 1.7.
1.7.1.1.7. Con: When Dartmouth College used approval voting for Board of Trustees elections, [voters selected 1.81 candidates per ballot](https://web.archive.org/web/20171021155818/http://scorevoting.net/DartmouthBack.html).
1.7.1.1.8. Con: In a non-binding [2002 French Approval Voting study](http://scorevoting.net/FrenchStudy.html), only 11.1% of voters bullet voted, and [ballots contained 3.15 approvals on average](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.734.5743&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
1.7.1.1.9. Pro: [In IEEE elections, 80% of voters bullet-voted.](http://approvalvoting.blogspot.com/)
1.7.1.1.9.1. Con: It could be that the bullet voters only cared about one candidate, rather than having complex opinions on multiple candidates.
1.7.1.1.9.2. Con: The other 20% still matter. The fact that 80% chose to bullet vote does not necessarily indicate that Approval in this case worked so poorly as FPtP would have.
1.7.1.1.10. Pro: In a [2018 straw poll](https://web.archive.org/web/20210622150052/https://www.counted.vote/diving_into_our_straw_poll_data_bullet_anti_voting) in Washington's 10th Congressional District, 60% of voters bullet-voted on their Approval ballots.
1.7.1.1.10.1. Con: In simulations, having 60% of voters always bullet-vote actually increased [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](http://electology.github.io/vse-sim/VSE/).
1.7.1.1.11. Pro: In the [2015 Republican Liberty Caucus straw poll](https://electowiki.org/wiki/2015_Republican_Liberty_Caucus_straw_poll#Approval_election), 70% bullet-voted.
1.7.1.1.11.1. Con: Straw polls and surveys can't be reliably compared to actual election strategy.
1.7.1.1.12. Con: Voters have learned strategy to use with FPtP while it has been in effect. Similarly, if Approval is enacted, voters will learn the strategy for that. And bullet voting is not the best strategy for voters who have a compromise candidate in mind. So we can expect bullet voting to decrease in frequency as voters grasp the meaning of the system in terms of the power relations it creates.
1.7.1.1.13. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.10.1.
1.7.1.2. Con: Approval's relative lack of expressiveness might make it more appealing to voters afraid of radical changes to ballot design.
1.7.1.3. Con: In large elections, voters, factions, and parties can use randomness to work Approval to have the same fineness of granularity as any other Score system can give them. - Decide how you would vote in fine-grained Range on a scale of zero to one. - Approve each candidate with a probability equal to the score you would have given her.
1.7.2. Pro: Approval voting is a very simple modification of FPTP and easily understood.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Approval voting can be implemented on existing ballots and voting machines.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Approval voting is more similar to FPTP than other alternative voting systems, and therefore more acceptable to the public.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Approval voting is FPTP voting without the extra step of discarding ballots with more than one candidate selected.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: Asset is also very similar to FPTP, yet it doesn't automatically follow that voters will like it.
1.7.2.2.3. Pro: Approval \(leaving out its strategy\) can be explained as similar to FPtP but _simpler_ by the removal of one constraint against the voter's freedom.
1.7.2.3. Pro: A voting system that is easy comprehensible to people will likely encourage more people to vote.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Approval voting largely retains the positive points of FPTP
1.7.2.4.1. Con: If voters bullet vote for their favorite in Approval Voting, it becomes sincere Plurality Voting, which is worse than strategic Plurality Voting.
1.7.2.4.1.1. Con: Voters will not bullet vote their favorite in Approval when they wouldn't do so in Plurality; they will generally vote for the candidate they would've strategically chosen in Plurality and all the candidates they prefer to that one.
1.7.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The change of voting method may make voters more naive or hopeful that they can get away with bullet voting their favorite, because the strategic dynamics for other voters have changed.
1.7.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a 3-way cyclical tie, Approval Voting can pick any of the candidates.
1.7.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If there is a 3-way cyclical tie, it doesn't matter who wins.
1.7.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It still matters who wins unless you ONLY care about the Condorcet winner.
1.7.2.4.2. Pro: Voters who are evaluating Approval Voting for reform can feel comfortable knowing that its worst-case scenario is just the current voting system.
1.7.2.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.4.1.
1.7.2.4.2.2. Pro: Approval Voting's ease of implementation also means that voters can feel comfortable voting for it, as it can be implemented and repealed at minimal cost or difficulty.
1.7.2.4.2.3. Pro: When a voter can more easily evaluate the worst-case scenario of reform and see that it's okay, that reform is more viable than another reform which actually has a better worst-case scenario, but voters don't realize/get fooled into thinking it doesn't.
1.7.2.4.3. Pro: Approval Voting is [precinct summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.7.2.4.4. Pro: It's really simple
1.7.2.4.4.1. Pro: It's even simpler than FPTP because it gets rid of the arcane rule stating that you can only vote for one candidate
1.7.2.4.4.2. Con: The simplicity might be a political liability, as the populace might be incredulous that its benefits can be real given the simplicity of the change.
1.7.2.4.4.2.1. Con: Any voter can understand, at the very least, that Approval always lets you vote your favorite, whereas FPTP doesn't.
1.7.2.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: This increase in honesty and the ability for third parties to grow in politics will be enough to persuade most voters to support Approval Voting.
1.7.2.4.4.2.2. Con: Approval Voting doesn't have to be sold as the best system or as a big change; advocates can simply claim it's an improvement, or the easy first step towards other democratic reform, without having to explain the plan.
1.7.2.4.4.2.2.1. Pro: FairVote is the largest voting reform organization, and their selling of IRV hinges on introducing STV later. Approval advocates could do the same with Score or Proportional Approval Voting.
1.7.2.4.5. Pro: It has a low [ballot spoilage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoilt_vote) rate.
1.7.2.4.5.1. Pro: It is harder to invalidate a ballot in approval voting than it is in FPTP
1.7.2.4.5.1.1. Pro: Approval voting reduces the ballot spoilage rate by a 5th \(Source: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q_eMUGCU5U\))\)
1.7.2.4.5.1.2. Con: It is easier to tamper with an approval ballot, adding support for candidates that weren't supported by the voter.
1.7.2.5. Con: Some voters will be scared or confused about whether some voters picking more candidates than others gives them more power.
1.7.2.5.1. Con: This can be counteracted by making disapprovals explicit, reminding the voters that they have as many votes \(+1 or −1\) as there are candidates.
1.7.2.5.1.1. Con: This ruins the simplicity and similarity to the status quo that Approval has.
1.7.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.7.2.5.2. Con: In fact, it is FPTP that gives voters who dislike a candidate but like several others "less power" than those who support that candidate. In Approval, equal numbers on both sides will cancel out.
1.7.2.5.2.1. Con: It is precisely this additional ballot power for those who vote for more than one \(if they want to\) that voters will fear, with no way of understanding how it might affect real elections or hurt various factions.
1.7.3. Pro: Under a model where a large number of  voters approve of all candidates within a certain "ideological distance" \("[oblivious random threshold](http://rangevoting.org/IEVS/Pictures.html)"\), Approval Voting [always elects the candidate who best represents voter opinion](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/).
1.7.3.1. Con: The Condorcet winner is not the best representative of public opinion, the utilitarian winner is.
1.7.3.2. Con: Approval Voting only elects Condorcet winners under certain strategic assumptions. When voters focus on future elections or are indifferent, Approval can [fail to elect](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/bajkw5/ballot_uncertainty_in_score/ekdudrd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the Condorcet winner.
1.7.4. Con: Approval voting hurts voters who approve of additional candidates beyond their favorite \(Hence, it violates the [later-no-harm criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later-no-harm_criterion)\).
1.7.4.1. Con: Voters who do not approve of multiple candidates run the risk of electing their worst choice. These two risks must be carefully weighed by each voter.
1.7.4.2. Con: Later-no-harm is only a potential issue with approval voting when a voter's favorite and compromise candidate are close in an election.
1.7.4.3. Con: Later-no-harm is conditional on a voter choosing to support more than one viable candidate. They are not forced into it.
1.7.5. Pro: Approval voting always lets you support your honest favorite candidate. \(It satisfies the [Favorite Betrayal Criterion](https://rangevoting.org/FBCexecSumm.html).\)
1.7.5.1. Pro: When voters can always pick their honest favorite, politics becomes far more representative and honest.
1.7.6. Con: Approval voting violates “one person, one vote”.
\(Source: [Critique #5](https://electology.org/blog/ten-critiques-and-defenses-approval-voting)\)
1.7.6.1. Pro: A [corrupt or incompetent](https://rangevoting.org/BrownSmallwood.html) court may not recognize that this method passes "one person, one vote"
1.7.6.1.1. Con: Corrupt and incompetent courts could find a similar excuse to strike down anything except FPTP.
1.7.6.2. Con: This is an incorrect interpretation of "one person, one vote". One person, one vote actually means that [state legislative districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims) must have roughly the same population, and thus the same weighting.
1.7.6.3. Con: Letting each person have a vote on each candidate, violates "one person, one vote" no more than letting each person have a vote in each election.
1.7.6.4. Con: Elections should be treated as popularity contests where the candidates "liked" by the most voters deserve to win, therefore Approval doesn't violate OPOV by allowing voters to indicate that they like more than one candidate.
1.7.6.5. Con: Despite the [fourteenth amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv), each person's vote does not always equal another's. A vote in California will not carry the same weight as a vote in Ohio.
1.7.6.5.1. Con: This difference is due to the electoral college, not the voting system used. \(For discussion on the Electoral College: [kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-electoral-college-be-abolished-2469/2469.0=2469.1/=2469.1) \)
1.7.6.6. Con: [Originally US presidential elections](http://rangevoting.org/BurrDilemma.html#earlyus) saw electors cast more than one vote each. The roots of American democracy are in agreement with approval voting's methodology
1.7.6.7. Con: The spirit of "one person, one vote" is that each person should have the same amount of power via their vote as each other. Approval upholds this spirit. A vote against a candidate is as powerful as a vote for that candidate, as evidenced by the fact that if voter B opposes the candidates voter A favors and favors those A opposes, and they vote accordingly, their votes cancel. Therefore the system accorded A and B equal power.
1.7.7. Con: Approval voting would choose bland winners.
1.7.7.1. Con: Bland milktoast candidates only win if people vote for them.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: Indifferent voters may pick any number of candidates they have even the slightest attraction to.
1.7.7.2. Con: This is not supported by voting data. Example: [electionscience.org](https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/the-early-2020-democratic-primary-comparing-voting-methods/)
1.7.7.3. Con: Better that bland candidates win than polarizing candidates, because bland candidates don't do anything that takes away the legitimacy of government.
1.7.7.3.1. Con: Having too many incompetent candidates win elections threatens government stability, as the "deep state" and other interests begin to make the real decisions, rather than any large subset of the people.
1.7.7.3.1.1. Pro: It's better to let a large subset of the people elect a polarizing, but powerful candidate, than to pick a bland candidate who appeals to everyone, but who can't meaningfully do anything.
1.7.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: A candidate who wants to do everything, will accomplish nothing.
1.7.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Different parts of the legislature may clash, making it impossible to push forward the bland parts of a bland candidate's agenda.
1.7.7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is true for any legislature that is too polarized to accomplish something.
1.7.7.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Voting methods that encourage some polarization in the legislature may still be better than compromise in the legislature, if the method also incorporates elements, such as winner-take-all districts, that allow one polarized subset of voters to take a majority of seats.
1.7.8. Con: Approval voting doesn’t always elect a majority winner. \([Critique 7](https://www.electionscience.org/voting-methods/ten-critiques-and-defenses-on-approval-voting/)\)
1.7.8.1. Con: If there is one candidate who has a majority, AV will elect him. If there are multiple candidates who have a majority, AV will choose the biggest majority.
1.7.8.2. Con: Approval can elect a consensus winner, who might produce more overall satisfaction than a majority winner. For example suppose there are three candidates A, B, and C, and 51% of the voters would evaluate C at 1, B at .99, and A at 0, and the remaining voters would evaluate A at 1, B at .99, and C at 0. Then the majority winner C produces .51 * 1 overall satisfaction, or .51, but the consensus winner B produces .99 * .51 + .99 * .49 satisfaction, or .99.
1.7.9. Con: Approval Voting can fail to elect the condorcet winner, assuming one exists.
1.7.9.1. Con: Approval elects Condorcet winners much more frequently than FPTP.
1.7.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.
1.7.9.1.2. Pro: In [Merrill's 1984](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2110786) Condorcet efficiency simulations, Approval performed the same or better than FPTP under all scenarios tested.
1.7.10. Pro: Approval voting tends to elect the median candidates who are approved by more voters on average than more extreme candidates.
1.7.11. Pro: Approval voting is more expressive than FPTP because voters are allowed to indicate their support for more than one candidate
1.7.12. Pro: There is very little opportunity for [invalid ballots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoilt_vote), since any combination of approvals is valid.
1.7.13. Pro: Approval Voting has a history of successful usage.
1.7.13.1. Pro: In the 13th through 18th centuries, the Republic of Venice elected the Doge of Venice using [a multi-stage process](https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2007/HPL-2007-28R1.pdf) that featured random selection and voting that allowed approval of multiple candidates and required a supermajority.
1.7.13.2. Pro: Approval voting was used in Greek legislative elections from [1864 to 1923](https://rangevoting.org/GreekApproval.html).
1.7.13.3. Pro: [The Catholic Church](http://rangevoting.org/PopeSummary.html) successfully used approval voting for over 300 years to elect 41 popes.
1.7.13.4. Pro: A limited variant of Approval voting was used to elect the [first 4 US Presidents](http://rangevoting.org/BurrDilemma.html#earlyus) making it an American Tradition.
1.7.13.4.1. Con: The original system used to elect presidents and vice-presidents was considered flawed and repealed by the [12th amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).
1.7.13.5. Pro: Political Parties currently using it internally

Colorado Libertarian Party
Texas Libertarian Party
Texas Green Party
Reform Party \(US National\)
Modern Whig Party \(US National\)
German Pirate Party \(North Rhine-Westphalia\)
German Pirate Party \(Lower Saxony\)
1.7.14. Pro: The most powerfully strategic ballot is almost always an honest ballot. Something that is not true for most voting systems.
1.7.15. Con: Approval is an impoverished version of Score/Range voting, and has negligible \(no?\) benefits over that method
1.7.15.1. Pro: Score Voting has [empirically been found](https://rangevoting.org/HonestyExec.html) to yield more honest, expressive results than Approval Voting, which will make it better.
1.7.15.1.1. Con: It's more complex than other good systems.
1.7.15.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.7.15.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.7.15.3. Con: Approval is the simplest to implement and use for public elections.
1.7.15.3.1. Con: Score Voting can [be used on modern election machines](http://www.scorevoting.net/kokidea.txt); that property is not specific to Approval.
1.7.15.3.1.1. Con: Score Voting is harder to implement on modern voting machines, and it is inconvenient to use on certain types of them, depending also on the scale used \(0-5, etc.\)
1.7.15.3.1.2. Con: Score Voting may be more easily hijacked or tampered with on voting machines, because it involves points given, not votes given.
1.7.15.3.1.2.1. Con: Any ballot design involving marking ink onto ballots will be susceptible to hijacking.
1.7.15.3.1.2.2. Con: Score ballots are harder to tamper with, because the only way to completely invalidate a ballot is to change or obscure every score on the ballot, which requires several steps. FPTP ballots can be invalidated in one mark simply by marking a second name.
1.7.15.3.1.3. Con: Score Voting intuitively feels harder or even impossible to use on existing voting machines, requiring more displays of proof and confirmation to fearful voters than Approval Voting.
1.7.15.3.1.3.1. Pro: It is easier for someone constructing FUD to make voters oppose Score Voting by making them feel it will be tampered/not easily implementable.
1.7.15.3.1.3.2. Con: The only people who truly need to be concerned about "existing voting machines" are those who are in charge of running elections.
1.7.15.3.1.3.2.1. Con: The voters may not need to be concerned, but they might become so.
1.7.15.3.1.3.2.2. Con: Voting machines are expensive and those expenses have to come from taxpayer dollars or debt.
1.7.16. Pro: Elections which use approval voting can be completed in a single trip to the polls. Primary elections are not necessary.
1.7.17. Pro: Approval voting's simplicity and similarity to FPTP make it a good [Schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_\(game_theory\)) for reformers primarily looking to move away from FPTP.
1.7.18. Pro: Since Approval Voting is a subcategory of Score Voting, Approval Voting inherits the pros mentioned under Score Voting except those that depend on fine granularity.
1.7.19. Pro: There is already a movement towards approval voting.
1.7.19.1. Pro: [St. Louis](https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/politics/elections/st-louis-approval-voting-primary/63-49bf3c9d-fba0-4377-a3b6-096c8f931cff) has switched to Approval Voting.
1.7.19.2. Pro: There is already a large organization behind Approval Voting in the United States. [electionscience.org](https://electionscience.org)
1.7.19.3. Pro: Fargo, ND recently switched to Approval Voting \([vox.com](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/15/18092206/midterm-elections-vote-fargo-approval-voting-ranked-choice?)\)
1.8. A [Condorcet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) \(such as [Tideman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs), [Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method), [Copeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland's_method), etc.\)
1.8.1. Con: All Condorcet systems fail Favorite Betrayal, meaning you can sometimes be better off not supporting your favorite maximally.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Single-winner systems that fail Favorite Betrayal tend towards two-party domination under [Duverger's Law.](https://www.electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/voting-theory-what-is-duvergers-law/)
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Such systems can still be superior to FPTP because some of them allow for inter-faction competition in the general election.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Two-faction domination is not much better than two-party/candidate domination.
1.8.2. Pro: Condorcet systems guarantee that if one candidate is preferred to all others, they will win.
1.8.2.1. Con: This is false. Condorcet voting methods can and do fail to elect Condorcet winners due to strategic voting. For more detail on this: [rangevoting.org](http://rangevoting.org/CondStratProb.html)
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: In fact, in a variety of mixtures of both honest and strategic voters, approval and score voting are even more Condorcet than Condorcet methods themselves! [scorevoting.net](http://scorevoting.net/StratHonMix.html)
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: It's a ridiculous claim to say that the Irish are more French than the French.  If one's measure of goodness is how high a degree of "Condorcet" a voting method is, the standard is the standard.
1.8.2.1.1.1.1. Con: What that claim was actually saying is that Approval and Score can elect Condorcet winners, and "Condorcet" methods can fail to, if voters are strategic. Extreme example: [www.rangevoting.org](http://www.rangevoting.org/DH3.html)
1.8.3. Con: The Condorcet Winner is not necessarily the Utilitarian Winner.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Voting methods based on majority rule tend to split a country into evenly divided halves that seek to dominate and destroy each other in a bid for power.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Utilitarian methods, by virtue of allowing voters to decrease their impact on the results, allow compromise and decrease factionalism and division.
1.8.3.2. Con: The Condorcet Winner is *usually* the same as the Utilitarian Winner. [Condorcet meets Bentham: "in a large population, the utilitarian outcome will be selected by any Condorcet consistent voting rule"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304406815000518)
1.8.3.2.1. Con: Over time, as rating systems collect more information than Condorcet system and elect even slightly more utilitarian winners, the parallel realities under Condorcet and utilitarian systems will start to pick increasingly different \(and differing in quality\) winners.
1.8.3.3. Pro: Simple graphical example [here](https://i.imgur.com/hsbbkgE.png): C is the candidate that best represents the voting population, but Condorcet methods choose A, because A is slightly preferred by a majority.
1.8.3.4. Pro: Simple conceptual example [here](https://leastevil.blogspot.com/2012/03/tyranny-of-majority-weak-preferences.html): A slight preference by the majority causes majoritarian and Condorcet methods to choose the option that leaves 1/3 of the population hungry.  Utilitarian methods choose the option that maximizes the well-being of the entire population.
1.8.3.4.1. Con: Utilitarian methods may pick an option that lacks majority consent, creating conditions for repeal or discontent.
1.8.3.4.1.1. Con: The majority is unlikely to get an option they dislike enough to repeal the method.
1.8.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Any amount of majority discontent may act as momentum against reform, because voters who are considering the method for the first time, did not participate in elections under it, and who do not understand the method may be swayed against it if they hear news from other areas that the majority was even slightly displeased with the results.
1.8.3.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Dartmouth and other polls](https://www.fairvote.org/new_lessons_from_problems_with_approval_voting_in_practice) are evidence of how establishment figures and critics looking for evidence against the reform \(FairVote\) can turn the lack of majority approval that utilitarian methods can \(honestly\) represent into an attack on the method's quality.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Approval Voting, because it forces voters to give their full vote to options they only slightly prefer, can't let a minority beat the majority without vote-splitting.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: [Dartmouth](https://www.fairvote.org/the_troubling_record_of_approval_voting_at_dartmouth) is proof of how this vote-splitting can happen in practice.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Colleges are generally required to nominate multiple candidates that are likely to share majority approval, whereas in public elections, parties often only nominate one candidate for their side.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Condorcet methods would be considered superior to utilitarian methods because they would allow multiple candidates to run from one party without risk of the "majority-vote-splitting helping the minority" pathology of Approval or the "indifferent majority allowing the strong minority to win"
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: One of the biggest benefits to any voting reform is that it will allow more competition, and utilitarian methods may fail this in practice \(as well as in theoretical discussion\), as they can result in vote-splitting or low scoring among indifferent majorities.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the majority is indifferent, it shouldn't matter who wins the election, as long as it's not someone the majority hates.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Optics demands that a method show this explicitly in its results, otherwise those who do not know the theory of the voting system will side with the conclusion that the method hurts the majority of voters.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Utilitarian methods that use cardinal \(scored\) ballots will do this more explicitly than those that use Plurality-style ballots \(like Approval Voting\)
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A lot of the time the only voting results that are shown are the final tallies, not the actual distribution of scores/votes or number of ballots a candidate was scored/approved on. Therefore, scored ballots will show more support for the winner, because the majority can score them low, but most evaluating the method's results from afar will still have no way of knowing whether the majority actually scored the candidates low, or if they were vote-splitting by only supporting their favorites.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Allowing the minority to win when the majority is indifferent is the key to compromise.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It could allow a dangerous/over-eager minority seize power, as appeared to happen in [Dartmouth](https://www.rangevoting.org/DartmouthRept083007.pdf), making changes that are bad for the majority, or so threatening to the political establishment that they encourage it to repeal/weaken the method.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Allowing energetic minorities to use power when the majority is indifferent means that changes favorable to that minority can be made without overt hostility.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It could also lead to changes bad for the majority being made.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The odds that the minority would look for such short-term gain \(because the majority would likely look for revenge in future elections\) over long-term compromise are unlikely.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if the odds are unlikely, the naive observer may believe that the odds are unacceptably high or higher than they really are. To counter this appearance and possible loss of support/source of opposition, one should pursue voting methods less likely to allow minorities to beat majorities in the first place.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Some decisions are made only once, rather than being repeated \(like elections\), so the majority may have no recompense if the minority hurts them.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: It's better to leave the margin of error in favor of the majority, rather than the minority, in the voting method.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: This favors methods like Approval Voting, where the only way for the minority to beat the minority is if there are multiple majority candidates that split the vote, which is only likely if the majority is really indifferent to winning and bullet votes.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Even if it is, in reality, better to leave the margin of error in favor of the minority, appeasing the naive fears of the public is more important than doing what's technically best, if it helps get reform more quickly/easily.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.
1.8.4. Con: Condorcet systems are complicated to count and to explain to voters.
1.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.8.4.2. Con: The negative vote-counting approach \(count the number of ballots a candidate was ranked on, and then indicate which matchups they are **not** preferred in\) may make vote-counting easier. [Negative vote-counting approach on Electowiki](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Pairwise_counting#Negative_vote-counting_approach)
1.8.4.3. Pro: Condorcet complexity is an issue of perception, not reality: Other systems become similarly complex when tiebreaking rules are included.
1.8.5. Pro: Assuming symmetrically-distributed honest voters ranking candidates according to ideological distance, Condorcet methods [always choose the candidate who best matches the ​centroid of voter opinion](http://rangevoting.org/IEVS/Pictures.html).
1.8.5.1. Con: This is too many assumptions.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.1.11.3.
1.8.8. Pro: In simulations, Condorcet systems produce higher [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](https://electology.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html) than all other systems tested, when voters are 100% honest.
1.8.8.1. Con: VSE must be wrong here, as if the voters' utilities/satisfaction is what determines the quality of a method, 100% honest Score Voting, with some caveats for the number of options on the scale, is the best method by theory.
1.8.8.2. Con: That relies on 100% honest voting; both Condorcet methods tested are far more susceptible to strategic voting than Score or STAR.  
At even 50% strategic, Score and STAR both surpass them.
1.8.9. Con: Condorcet methods are all vulnerable to strategic exaggeration where voters can get a better result by exaggerating the gap between where the two front runners lie on their preferences. Because of this, all Condorcet candidates are also incredibly vulnerable to [DH3 pathology](http://scorevoting.net/DH3.html) which results in unpopular candidates that nobody wanted getting elected.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Unlike ranked-choice systems, there is never any strategic incentive to swap preferences while rating candidates.  \(There is incentive to exaggerate, but never to score A \> B when your true preference is B \> A.\)
1.8.9.1.1. Con: There can be a strong strategic incentive to equalize the scores of multiple candidates, which provides less information than honest rankings.
1.8.10. Pro: Condorcet methods preserve the principle of "[One-person-one-vote](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/one-person_one-vote_rule)".
1.8.10.1. Con: -> See 1.7.6.1.
1.8.11. Pro: Condorcet Methods avoid tactical voting burdens.
1.8.12. Pro: Condorcet methods are simpler than IRV.
1.8.13. Con: Systems that require voters to evaluate multiple candidates are onerous and prone to voters not knowing enough to correctly vote on viable candidates.
1.8.13.1. Con: Voters have the option of studying a subset of the candidates and voting full opposition to the others.
1.8.13.1.1. Con: This would lead to vote-splitting if everyone did it with different subsets of candidates.
1.9. ...It should not change its system. The US should continue using the First-Past-The-Post voting system \(Aka Plurality\). Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting)
1.9.1. Con: It falls victim to [vote splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting), where a third party candidate will weaken/draw votes from the most similar strong party.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Which encourages strategic voting \(aka [Tactical voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting)\). In this instance voters vote for the better of the strongest two, rather than their actual favorite \(when these differ\).
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Thus, FPTP serves to entrench an existing 2 party system \(which is generally regarded as a undesirable thing\).
1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: The 2 party system inevitably polarizes to extremes as party candidates seek to absorb issues into their platform. This disenfranchises the mainstream electorate that would prefer moderate candidates.
1.9.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The American political parties are relatively closely alligned in some policies when compared to systems with more than 2 parties.
1.9.1.1.1.2. Con: Two party systems have the chance to produce political momentum to make wide ranging changes because it is always one party dominating.
1.9.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Two-party systems kill political momentum, as each winner tries to undo all of the previous winner's work.  Electing more moderate candidates would avoid this flip-flopping.
1.9.1.1.1.3. Con: outside the United States, FPTP voting has no tendency at all to produce two party politics
[blogs.lse.ac.uk](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/duvergers-law-dead-parrot-dunleavy/)
1.9.1.1.2. Pro: Because of this, third parties are poorly represented under FPTP.
1.9.1.2. Con: Outsider candidates have had success by working within the main political parties.
1.9.1.3. Pro: Which is one of the causes of the [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect), where a strong candidate will lose, because the spoiler candidate participated in the election.
1.9.2. Pro: Present rhetoric aside, this system has facilitated over a century of consecutive peaceful transfers of power.
1.9.2.1. Con: So have many other systems. That is a minimal requirement that it has indeed largely proven to pass, but it has resulted in recurring periods of extreme polarization, and mistrust of government and other institutions. It also has comparatively low engagement and more dramatic swings of power than many other systems.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Given that the first-past-the-post system tends to result in successful transfers of power, it protects the basic tenets of our political system by preventing tyranny and upholding democratic principles.
1.9.2.3. Con: Above being perceived to be a sufficiently fair system, voting methods do not contribute to peaceful transitions of power. Rather, it is faith in political / government institutions, and maturity from incoming and outgoing politicians that ensures peaceful transisitons of power.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: U.S. elections are stable enough that adopting a different system would not jeopardize peaceful transfer of power.
1.9.2.3.2. Con: If the voting accurately represents the strength of the different factions, it tends to persuade weaker factions not to revolt -- because they will know they are the weaker side.
1.9.2.4. Con: This does not hold when you consider the use of FPTP globally.
1.9.2.4.1. Pro: Countries such as [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina#Rise_of_the_modern_nation), [Gabon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon#History), and [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar#Independence_\(1948%E2%80%931962\)) have seen less than peaceful transisitions of power despite using FPTP.
1.9.2.5. Con: That mostly says it has been in use for a long time. Usually most people WANT peaceful transfer of power, and it's a particularly bad system that prevents it.
1.9.2.6. Con: One century, but not two, as the election of an abolitionist president \(Lincoln\) helped trigger the US Civil War.
1.9.3. Con: This system results in [wasted winning votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote).
1.9.3.1. Pro: The limit of FPTP systems can have as little as 1 meaningful vote.
1.9.3.2. Con: Most voting systems in majoritarian elections contain a [threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold) too.
1.9.4. Pro: FPTP is [precinct-summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.9.4.1. Con: Most other voting systems are precinct-summable as well.
1.9.5. Con: Voter participation is extremely low in the US because many voters feel the available candidates do not represent them.
1.9.5.1. Con: A change in voting system may not improve participation.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Ability to vote for candidates that closely align with a voter’s personal beliefs is an incentive to vote. Alternative systems make this more likely to occur.
1.9.5.3. Pro: Thus the usage of FPTP is a threat to the concept of democracy the constitution was built upon.
1.9.6. Pro: As a result of FPTP, the two party system in the US has great internal diversity.
1.9.6.1. Con: Extreme political views tend to be rejected or marginalized in the main political parties.
1.9.6.2. Pro: Party members are allowed to propose directions and agendas for their parties at caucuses.
1.9.6.3. Pro: There are no restrictions on who can join either political party.
1.9.6.4. Pro: Because a large percentage of Americans are affiliated with the political party, a large proportion of the potential diversity is also captured by the internal membership of the parties.
1.9.6.5. Con: Smaller parties while being less internally diverse would better represent the needs of their constituencies.
1.9.6.5.1. Pro: Large parties are unable to represent a diverse set of interests for that would result in the party looking divided.
1.9.6.5.1.1. Pro: In the UK, the [party whip](https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/parliamentary-secretary-to-the-treasury-and-chief-whip) and conventions such as [collective cabinet responsibility](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/collective-responsibility) tend to prevent any single member of Parliament from undermining the general party line.
1.9.6.5.1.2. Con: There are a number of candidates from the Democratic Party, with [different policy positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_the_2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primary_candidates), running for Presidential nominee.
1.9.6.5.1.2.1. Con: To the extent that candidates with diverse positions have gotten support, they have made the Democratic Party look divided.
1.9.6.6. Con: The UK and Canada also use FPTP and their parties have much lower internal ideological diversity.
1.9.7. Con: There are multiple instances of FPTP being repealed, implying it won't last long. [www.fairvote.org](http://www.fairvote.org/rcv_in_us_elections)
1.9.8. Pro: One voting process change invites the next change, and this becomes just another form of gerrymandering, manipulating the rules to achieve a desired outcome.
1.9.8.1. Con: Anyone currently in power would be best served by retaining the voting method that got them into power, not by changing it.
1.9.8.2. Con: The analogy to gerrymandering is invalid. Well-designed voting methods \(nearly all of the ones discussed here except for FPTP\) cannot be used to skew elections towards particular parties.
1.9.9. Con: FPTP is a strictly inferior voting method. For example, Approval Voting is equally simple, summable, can operate on exactly the same ballots & voting machines, but overcomes FPTP's most significant weakness \(spoiler effect\).
1.9.10. Con: FPTP is one of the least expressive voting methods, because voters may give a "yes" to only one candidate.
1.9.10.1. Pro: FPTP effectively forces voters to rank/rate all but one of the candidates the same.
1.9.11. Con: FPTP results in "[wasted losing​ votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote)".
1.9.12. Pro: It is extremely simple and intuitive.
1.9.12.1. Pro: The US populace already has trouble encouraging participation in voting, complicating the procedure may cause additional absences from the poll.
1.9.12.2. Pro: Changing the system to something more complex may discourage participation from voters who have recently come of voting age or have not voted in the past.
1.9.12.3. Con: FPTP requires voters to be election strategists, following news and polls, and guessing what other voters are going to do, because of the threat of "wasting a vote". This is not simple.
1.9.12.4. Con: People vote for multiple candidates at varying sizes of locality, determined by arbitrary lines drawn by the politicians for which they are voting. It is not simple.
1.9.12.4.1. Con: This comment reflects the complexity of our government, not the complexity of FPTP.
1.9.12.5. Pro: You can not name a simpler voting system.
1.9.12.5.1. Con: Random winner is simpler. Choose one ballot out of the whole pile and make that ballot's choice the winner. An even simpler system is to throw away the votes and choose a candidate at random from the list.
1.9.12.5.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.2.1.
1.9.13. Con: FPTP has [a best-case Voter Satisfaction Efficiency of 86%](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html), which is worse than any other method simulated. It's also worse than the worst-case VSEs of 3-2-1, STAR, and Ranked Pairs voting.
1.9.14. Pro: Changing systems could be costly.
1.9.14.1. Pro: The current government would be strongly opposed to changing voting structure.
1.9.14.2. Con: If problems with the current voting system lead to the dissolution of the US government, then the cost would have been immaterial.
1.9.14.3. Con: Replacing FPTP with approval voting would not be costly.
1.9.14.4. Con: Choosing winners who are polar opposites every other election is much more costly, as they repeatedly undo each other's work.
1.9.14.5. Pro: A change of Britain's voting system to IRV/AV was estimated to cost about [250mn pounds](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357038/New-voting-switch-cost-250m.html).
1.9.14.6. Pro: Next to economic cost, every citizen pays an opportunity cost because they have to learn how the new system works.
1.9.15. Con: FPtP violates the spirit of "one person, one vote".
1.9.15.1. Con: "[One person, one vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man,_one_vote#United_States)" is more concerned with equal vote weighting due to the [relative sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesberry_v._Sanders) of legislative districts.
1.9.15.2. Pro: If there are more than two candidates, no vote has an anti-vote in the system. The system does not accord equal power to a supporter of a candidate as to a voter who opposes that candidate and supports all the others. Therefore, it violates "one person, one vote".
1.10. "Vote for 2" then Instant Runoff. "Vote for 2" is a standard method for choosing two winners. Runoff is the standard method for choosing between two candidates. Both of these steps can be performed with a single reading of each ballot. The method is described at [http://www.classicalmatter.org/Election%20Science/Vote2ThenInstantRunoff.html](http://www.classicalmatter.org/Election%20Science/Vote2ThenInstantRunoff.html).
1.11. Bucklin Voting - voters submit ranked ballots of their top N preferences. In the first round, only #1 votes are counted. If there isn't a majority winner, the next rank of votes are added in, Approval-style, until a majority winner occurs \(or ranks are exhausted\). Described here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucklin_voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucklin_voting)
1.12. STAR Voting \(Score Then Automatic Runoff\).
Described Here: [www.equal.vote](http://www.equal.vote)/
1.12.1. Con: As Score Voting is a Likert scale used as interval data, [this makes a false presumption that all voters treat an arbitrary numeric interval in the same manner](http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~kristina/topic-dane-likert.pdf). This gives disproportionate influence to voters with strongly expressed preferences, and those that strategically game the ballot.
1.12.1.1. Con: [The leading model](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/spenkuch/research/voting.pdf) of voting behaviour is the Expressive model, not the Pivotal model.
Voters care more about self-expression than tipping the balance, almost to exclusion.
[This paper](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~nuff0084/FisherTT.pdf) analysing tactical voting in the UK shows that it is unrelated to marginality, and after accounting for selection bias of low turnout contention of 3rd parties are also a non-factor.
Rational actors don't vote because of the paradox of voting.
1.12.1.2. Con: Voters would be aware that their scores are just used in a simple count, same as their marks are used in a simple count in FPTP. The numbers would not be associated with arbitrary terms as with the Likert Scale.
1.12.1.3. Con: Voters from many ideologies COULD vote for third party candidates, or write in candidates under the current system, and by doing so they would be casting an unstrategic vote. The vast majority of voters however vote for one of the two major party candidates, because the messaging about "throwing your vote away" is so pervasive. Under a Score system there would be similar messaging about not using the whole range, since no party would want their voters to accidentally weaken their votes.
1.12.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.3.1.
1.12.1.5. Con: An even stronger claim could be made of the intervals between ranks. The difference between 1st and 2nd could be almost-equals or polar opposites.
1.12.1.6. Pro: The tendency of cardinal systems to prefer those who "game" the ballot may tend to hurt their legitimacy and lead to repeal or loss of momentum.
1.12.1.6.1. Con: Ordinal systems incentivize worse "gaming" than cardinal systems do, even to the point of inverting the orders of candidates.
1.12.2. Con: Utility requires compromise and cooperation, whereas voting requires competition.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Some voters prefer majority rule, as they either don't believe in utilitarianism, don't like it, don't understand it, or don't think it can be used/measured in politics.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: It's easier to fight for majority rule, which everyone knows and likes a bit, than a whole new moral and political philosophy, when trying to reform the world or politics.
1.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.12.2.1.1.2. Pro: Majority rule works on preference relations, which everyone agrees work.
1.12.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.12.2.1.2. Pro: It is easier to fight utilitarianism than majority rule on the grounds that two voters' utilities can't be compared, or that voters won't/can't honestly report their utilities. It may not be true, but more effort is required to counter these kinds of claims.
1.12.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.1.1.2.
1.12.2.1.3. Con: One can't simultaneously argue utilitarianism is impossible in politics, and that it is bad for politics because it allows/"forces" compromise.
1.12.2.1.3.1. Con: Voters, and the charlatans opposing reform, can get away with highly illogical arguments when nobody is paying attention.
1.12.2.1.4. Pro: Majority rule is premised on factional competition, while utilitarianism is premised on the idea that two candidates can draw differing amounts of support from the same people, and that the "amount" of support supersedes number of strong supporters. This breaks our intuitions, and forces us to do more thought work than necessary to obtain reform in politics.
1.12.2.1.4.1. Pro: The less explicitly utilitarian a method, and more easily it can be defined in terms of pairwise relations/Condorcet, the less initial resistance it faces in overcoming traditional views on majority rule and how politics should be.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Approval and Asset are the simplest methods that don't require explicit utilitarian thinking.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Asset is not utilitarian, and leans towards the Condorcet winner of candidate preferences weighted by voters' votes. This means it can fail to elect the candidate who maximizes voter happiness.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Asset can elect utilitarian winners if the candidates actively attempt to.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The candidates can use polling information \(cardinal methods like approval and score instead of vote-for-one\) to figure out who the utilitarian winner is.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If Asset polls are not the best at suggesting a winner, then the method is not the best for elections.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Most voters would prefer electing a Condorcet winner of voter preferences, not candidate preference weighted by votes.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Approval can be thought of as a Condorcet method with polling, as everyone can strategically vote for the frontrunner they prefer, and all the candidates they prefer to him.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Not all voters will follow this strategy, partially out of honesty, lack of polling, cognitive burden, and the fact that a Condorcet winner with low utility for a voter may be worse than a candidate with higher utility, but who can't grow in support for future elections unless supporters strategically vote [against](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/bajkw5/comment/ekdudrd) the Condorcet winner.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: A voter who is making an abstract, simple analysis may accept the Condorcet interpretation of Approval without thinking of it as utilitarian, which allows the idea to spread with less resistance.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is dishonest to spread an idea with one interpretation when you believe another interpretation is more likely to happen, and will have effects that the voter may find odious.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely voters will actually dislike utilitarianism in practice; it is only a matter of convincing them to try a method with a simple and plausible majoritarian strategy, and allow them to, themselves, adjust to a societal equilibrium where honesty and utilitarianism beat majority rule.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This "adjustment" will not happen without some voters being honest, and therefore it is still dishonest to tell all voters that this strategy is likely, when the desired \(and predicted\) outcome is utilitarianism, and when the refutation to majority rule is simple enough that it can be explained to voters and easily spread.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: For voters who are unlikely to support utilitarianism \(and that is many of them, at first\), using the Condorcet interpretation of Approval is the best anyone can do to get a better society in terms of initial steps; one can add in a caveat that Approval "fails Condorcet in some circumstances" and leave it at that. The voter will quickly discover, if the measure is adopted, precisely what benefits arise from the caveat.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This is still honest, while allowing voters to question and dig into the implications of non-Condorcet outcomes in utilitarian methods on their own.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.
1.12.2.1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Approval converges on a Condorcet winner or the Smith set over repeated polling/elections if everyone uses this strategy.
1.12.2.1.5. Con: A lack of understanding of utilitarianism can be fixed through voter education.
1.12.2.1.5.1. Con: The opportunity cost of educating voters about philosophy is the opportunity to educate more voters on reform.
1.12.2.1.5.1.1. Con: Utilitarianism is a good and useful philosophy, one whose benefits increase the more it is spread.
1.12.2.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.
1.12.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: The more voters know of reform, the more likely it is to be enacted.
1.12.2.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.2.
1.12.2.2. Con: Utility allows for compromise, but doesn't force it.
1.12.2.2.1. Con: In an election where voters don't know who might win, their expected strategy under utilitarian methods will force them to compromise to get a better outcome for themselves.
1.12.2.2.1.1. Con: Compromise is good for the group.
1.12.2.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.
1.12.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Sometimes compromise is bad for the group. It depends on the particular circumstance.
1.12.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: If a given compromise really is bad, and the candidates agree, then someone from the side that received more votes will win.
1.12.3. Pro: STAR voting tends to elect more representative candidates.
1.12.4. Con: In some scenarios, STAR voting can choose a majority winner over a utilitarian winner.  \(In [the pizza example](https://leastevil.blogspot.com/2012/03/tyranny-of-majority-weak-preferences.html), for instance, pepperoni would win the runoff and the vegetarian friend would go hungry.\)
1.12.4.1. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.
1.12.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.12.4.3. Con: This is true if there is only one option that can both meet the deeply held needs of a large minority while also appealing broadly to the majority. For pizza, this could be the case; in politics, it's much less likely. Candidates would be aware of the Score Round advantage of appealing to the impassioned minority so long as it doesn't significantly hurt their standing with the majority, and so two candidates that are acceptable to the minority are likely to advance to the runoff round.
1.12.4.3.1. Con: Two centrists may make it to the runoff, but the runoff selects for \(and thus incentivizes\) appeal to the majority, even if there is broader support for the runner up.

As such, candidates appeal to a \(simple\) majority will always be their top priority, and will only care about the minority if they cannot make the top two without them.
1.12.4.3.1.1. Con: The fact that the runoff is part of the same round as the "general election" will force candidates to make a tradeoff between majority approval and overall consent, meaning that there is a limit to how close to the majority they can get under STAR.
1.12.4.4. Con: Almost all voting methods \(including score and approval\) will choose the majority winner when voters are strategic. STAR simply makes honesty strategic in these scenarios.
1.12.4.4.1. Con: There are different kinds of strategies and not all voters will use them. Approval and Score can elect a consensus winner in less clear scenarios.
1.12.4.4.1.1. Con: Approval and Score can, in scenarios where nobody knows who might win, lead to voters bullet voting more often.
1.12.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: In several [large](https://www.electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/approval-voting-a-voice-for-independents/)-[scale](https://www.electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/approval-voting-smarter-elections-2016-approval-versus-plurality/) [political](https://rangevoting.org/Maine2014Exit.html) [studies](https://www.rangevoting.org/RangePolls.html), where voters tend to know who is leading and who is not, Approval and Score do not show significant bullet-voting.
1.12.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: In [several scenarios](https://www.fairvote.org/new_lessons_from_problems_with_approval_voting_in_practice) where voters had less information on who might win, voters tended to bullet-vote.
1.12.4.4.1.1.2.1. Con: At Dartmouth, voters knew over repeated elections that a minority favorite was winning often, yet they continued to bullet vote, signalling that they were okay/didn't care about the winner.
1.12.4.4.1.1.2.2. Con: All of those "several scenarios" were with Approval Voting, and not with Score Voting, which allows voters to give partial support for later preferences.
1.12.5. Pro: Assuming voters always use the full range for their scores, [STAR voting is more likely than Score to pick the winner that best represents public opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA).
1.12.5.1. Con: Such simulations assume a unimodal distribution, which [does not hold for the US](http://www.gotoquiz.com/politics/poli-compare-parties.html).  Because of that false assumption, it dismisses the utility losses of the population whose distribution is not centered on the "single voter" point, as illustrated by the [Pizza Example](https://leastevil.blogspot.com/2012/03/tyranny-of-majority-weak-preferences.html)
1.12.5.1.1. Con: Despite increasing political polarization, the United States is [still a unimodal distribution](http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/1-partisan-divides-over-political-values-widen/1_4-17/).
1.12.5.1.1.1. Con: A highly questionable claim, given the title of the linked article, "[Partisan divides over political values widen](http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/1-partisan-divides-over-political-values-widen/1_5-15/)" and the immediately following chart which demonstrates that the flat area around the overall median is the result of [two distinct distributions with decreasing overlap](http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/1-partisan-divides-over-political-values-widen/1_5-15/).

Were it truly unimodal, there wouldn't be obvious, and obviously disparate local maxima, as in the "unimodal distribution" graph
1.12.5.2. Con: The simulations in question presume a Majoritarian "Gold Standard." The so called "[ideal, single voter model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA&t=4m30s)" gives greater preference to a simple majority's preference than it does to the overall preference of the entire electorate, as in the [Pizza Example](https://leastevil.blogspot.com/2012/03/tyranny-of-majority-weak-preferences.html)
1.12.6. Pro: STAR voting reduces the possibility of [spoilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect).
1.12.6.1. Pro: This would lead to a drop in polarization and partisan anger. Voters would have more freedom to vote honestly, candidates would have more freedom to run honestly.
1.12.6.2. Con: STAR voting reduces spoilers, but it is still possible for a weak-runoff candidate to steal second place from a strong-runoff candidate and spoil the election.
1.12.7. Pro: STAR voting minimizes [tactical voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting).
1.12.7.1. Con: The Runoff step may encourage voters to exaggerate support for compromise candidates in an effort to help get them to replace the voter's opposition candidate as one of the runoff candidates \(ie, 9/6/3/0 -\> 9/8/1/0\), making the actual scores less meaningful.
1.12.7.1.1. Con: The more compromise candidates win, the better for society.
1.12.7.1.1.1. Con: Compromise candidates may not actually be preferable. It may be better to have polarization and effectiveness compared to compromise and inaction.
1.12.7.1.2. Con: The runoff step is only influenced by the general preference of the voter. ie: changing one's vote from 9/6/3/0 to 9/8/1/0 would change that vote's influence on the score step but not the runoff step.
1.12.7.1.3. Con: This example would increase the chances that your least favorite beats your second-least favorite.
1.12.7.1.3.1. Con: The Runoff step would still prefer C \(3rd favorite\) over D.  The only way it could hurt C would be if it put B into the runoff step instead of C.
1.12.7.1.4. Con: Regular Score Voting gives an incentive to exaggerate scores for compromise candidates \(but not above those for favorite candidates\) \(according to some numerical noodling I did but cannot point to\). The above assertion has not made clear how this would be worse with STAR.
1.12.7.2. Con: Voting systems should only incentivize, not force voters to be honest, because otherwise strategic voters will dislike the system.
1.12.7.2.1. Con: There is no way to force voters to be "honest", whatever that means.
1.12.7.2.2. Pro: An ideal voting system would reward voters for voting honestly.
1.12.7.3. Pro: In simulations, tactical voting only reduces [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html) by 8 percentage points.
1.12.7.4. Pro: In simulations, tactical voting backfires [roughly as often](http://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/stratstuff.html) as it succeeds.
1.12.8. Pro: STAR voting encourages candidates to campaign positively.
1.12.8.1. Pro: More honest campaigning better represents the people's wishes.
1.12.8.2. Pro: If two candidates have a similar ideology, voters can give more points to the more honest and polite person, without splitting votes or preventing their party from winning.
1.12.8.3. Pro: By campaigning more honestly, candidates increase political diversity and intelligent decision-making.
1.12.9. Pro: STAR voting encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters.
1.12.9.1. Con: STAR Voting will, in practice, force candidates to focus on majority preference, almost exclusively to the detriment of the consensus of the Score round.
1.12.9.1.1. Con: This may not work. Two consensus candidates may make the runoff, preventing the polarizing candidate's majority preference from showing.
1.12.9.2. Pro: Because being given a 2 instead of a 0 is just as useful as being given a 9 instead of a 7, a candidate can gain more ground, potentially, by convincing opposed voters that they aren't terrible, than by energizing voters who agree with them.
1.12.9.2.1. Pro: Encouraging opposition voters to give you more points would allow candidates to focus on multiple groups of voters, rather than just their base and "everyone else."
1.12.9.2.1.1. Con: Focusing on multiple groups of voters at once may encourage candidates to shift and make false, "weak" promises.
1.12.9.2.1.1.1. Con: If a candidate keeps shifting and making false promises, then neither their base nor moderates will take the candidate seriously.
1.12.9.2.1.1.2. Pro: The effect of candidates attempting to fool multiple groups of voters is increased if some voters are more strategic or honest than others, or if some voters are more coordinated with a candidate than others.
1.12.9.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Voters may get fooled once or twice, but if they are weak enough to continually get fooled, such would happen in any voting system.
1.12.9.3. Con: -> See 1.12.7.1.
1.12.9.4. Pro: Appealing to more voters gives politics as a whole more legitimacy and satisfaction.
1.12.9.5. Con: The candidates will attempt to have the least possible appeal to each individual voter, rather than attempting to sway any significant number of them and alienating others.
1.12.9.5.1. Con: A candidate cannot win off of 1's and 2's. You need to have enough support to score in the top two AND then beat the other top finisher to win.
1.12.10. Pro: STAR voting encourages voters to give real consideration to the relative strength of candidates they disagree with.
1.12.10.1. Con: Multiple-candidate evaluative methods force voters to know and support multiple candidates to cast an effective ballot, which makes them consider the individual merits of each candidate less.
1.12.10.1.1. Con: It's also the case with multi-candidate non-evaluative methods. To know for which one you are going to vote, which is to say the one you prefer, you have to consider them all.
1.12.10.1.2. Con: Primaries can be done to ensure more individual deliberation in the general election.
1.12.10.1.2.1. Con: Voters in the general election are still using the deliberation of other voters from the primary results and winners.
1.12.11. Pro: STAR voting makes it reasonably easy to count the votes.
1.12.11.1. Pro: [STAR voting is precinct-summable.​](http://www.equal.vote/star-vs-irv#simplicity)
1.12.11.1.1. Con: Star Voting makes it relatively easy to count the votes. That's a plus. But precinct-summable is not a good way to measure how easy it is to count the votes.
1.12.12. Con: STAR has only been subject to three years of theoretical analysis and has not been used for any local election. It is too early to adopt STAR for statewide races.
1.12.12.1. Con: If we never tried anything that had never been previously tried, we would never try anything new.
1.12.12.1.1. Con: Just because it's new doesn't mean it's valid. A peer reviewed paper would be enough to resolve this point.
1.12.13. Con: Failing the [favorite betrayal criterion](https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Favorite_Betrayal_criterion) is rare in STAR voting, but not impossible
1.12.13.1. Con: Such criterion failures will be hard to predict beforehand and unlikely to strongly affect results.
1.12.13.2. Con: Every voting system can have rare failures with various criteria, especially if certain "dumb" voter strategies are employed.
1.12.13.2.1. Con: Smart strategies can be expected to take hold once a given system is in place, as smart strategies took hold with FPtP.
1.12.13.2.1.1. Con: The voting system may be repealed before voters can learn and adapt to new strategies, if it yields a bad outcome under honesty/dumb strategy, as happened in [Burlington](https://www.equal.vote/burlington).
1.12.13.2.1.2. Pro: Under FPtP, voters have learned to discourage clone candidates from running lest they split the vote and and spoil the election. Since the experience of that voting system resulted in people learning strategy for it, we can expect that future experience with a different voting system enacted will lead people to learn its strategies.
1.12.13.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.12.13.2.1.1.
1.12.14. Con: If voters vote honestly, it is possible for voters to get a result that is worse than the result they would have gotten if they had not voted at all. While the chance of this happening in STAR voting may be a lot lower then the chance of it happening in a lot of other voting systems, it is not impossible.
1.12.15. Pro: 5-star ratings are a familiar interface.
1.12.16. Con: -> See 1.12.7.1.
1.12.17. Pro: In simulations, the worst-case [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html) of 10-point STAR voting is better than the best-case performance of IRV, Majority Judgment, and Plurality.
1.12.17.1. Con: VSE can't account for foolish strategies or voter ignorance on how the system works, as well as how candidates may shift under various voting systems.
1.12.17.1.1. Con: Voters will be quick to un-learn foolish strategies.
1.12.18. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.
1.12.19. Con: In 3-candidate races, if all voters naively Score the Dem max and GOP min, or vice versa, then either the dem or the GOP must win. This, however, is not always true with 4+ candidates.
1.12.19.1. Con: 3-candidate races will not happen enough for this to be a real issue. There will be pressure for several moderates to run and two moderates may make the runoff.
1.12.19.2. Con: If voters score the moderate somewhat highly on both sides, the moderate will win instead.
1.12.19.2.1. Pro: The moderate would receive the most points in a 3-candidate race, putting them in the runoff, and they'd have all the support of the opposition and moderate voters to beat either side's extremist.
1.12.19.2.1.1. Con: In the situation that was described \(3 claims up from this\), there were only 3 candidates and one polarizing extremist had a majority of first-place votes, and won the runoff.
1.12.19.2.2. Con: This is not true in the given situation. If a polarizing candidate is scored top by more than half of the voters \(and those voters score no other candidate top\), and that candidate makes the runoff, he/she will always win.
1.12.19.3. Con: If the third candidate is moderate relative to the electorate, this scenario is unlikely. Moderate voters will support the moderate candidate more than either major party candidate and rate them accordingly.
1.12.20. Con: -> See 1.7.15.1.1.
1.12.21. Con: Cardinal systems would incentivize voters to pick "moderate" candidates they know little of to beat the other side, which leaves the door open to heavy corruption and incompetence.
1.12.21.1. Con: Most likely there would be multiple different "moderates" and one could only give positive scores to the best ones.
1.12.22. Pro: Deterministic \(ballot-only\), meaning that only decisions made by the voters influence the election, which gives them control over the candidates.
1.12.22.1. Con: A method with Optional Delegation \(voter checks a box on the ballot to let their candidate vote for them, after the election, or using a pre-defined list generated by the candidate\) might not be deterministic, but would likely improve over the results of that method on its own.
1.12.22.1.1. Con: Optional Delegation is more ballot-tamperable and suspicious.
1.12.22.1.2. Con: Optional Delegation is more complex and difficult to implement.
1.12.22.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.13. Borda Count.
Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count)
1.13.1. Pro: Borda Count allows voters to make a judgement on multiple candidates [by ranking them in order of preference.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count)
1.13.2. Con: Borda count behaves poorly when voters are strategic.
1.13.2.1. Pro: The [DH3 pathology](http://scorevoting.net/DH3.html) in particular can cause the candidate least preferred by all voters to be elected.
1.13.3. Pro: Borda count is not majoritarian: It chooses broadly-supported consensus candidates rather than polarizing candidates that are only supported by half of the population.
1.13.3.1. Con: Score voting does this, but better.
1.13.3.2. Con: Borda voting forces candidates to be scored as "consensus" if there are several main rivals and a dozen nonentities. Result: a nonentity wins.
1.13.4. Con: The party that runs the most ridiculously huge mob of clones is much more likely to claim victory.
1.13.5. Con: Borda count has [a worst-case Voter Satisfaction Efficiency of -11%](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html), which is dramatically worse than any other method simulated. It's also worse than the VSE of selecting a candidate completely at random \(0%\).
1.13.5.1. Con: [Warren's VSE simulations](https://rangevoting.org/vsi.html) \(VSE is just the inverse of Bayesian regret\) don't find Borda count with strategic voters to be nearly as disastrous.
1.14. The Top-Two Runoff \(or Two-Round System\).
Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system)
1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.
1.14.2. Con: Top-two runoff suffers from vote-splitting.
1.14.3. Con: Top Two in the first round is heavily vulnerable to strategy because it is still a FPTP ballot, even if it selects 2 finalists.
1.15. Majority Judgment
Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment)
1.15.1. Pro: Majority judgement satisfies the [favorite betrayal criterion](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Favorite_betrayal_criterion), so it is always safe to give the highest grade to your favorite candidate.
1.15.2. Pro: Majority judgement is [cloneproof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_clones_criterion).
1.15.3. Pro: Majority judgement is [monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion).
1.15.4. Pro: Majority judgement is [precinct-summable](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.15.4.1. Con: Precinct-summable does not tell us anything particularly useful.
1.15.5. Con: Majority judgement fails the [participation criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_criterion), so it is possible for a voter to get a worse result than they would've had they not voted.
1.15.6. Con: In simulations, majority judgement has [a best-case Voter Satisfaction Efficiency of 91%](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html), which is worse than the worst-case VSE of 3-2-1 and about the same as the worst-case VSE of STAR.
1.15.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.
1.15.8. Pro: [The system's inventors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment) mathematically proved that this system was the most "strategy-resistant" of any system that satisfies certain criteria considered desirable by the authors.
1.15.8.1. Con: It has never been tested, so we don't know whether it's actually the best.
1.15.8.1.1. Pro: The system has be tested only theoretically, not practically.
1.15.8.1.2. Con: At least two of the three main well-tested systems \(FPTP and IRV; the third is Top-Two\) have been proven to lead to two-party domination and have several major flaws. It may be time for a change.
1.15.8.2. Con: Given how strong the political divides are in the US, the likelihood that people will rate any candidate from the opposing party extremely low while voting any candidate from their party extremely high, tactical voting is likely to have a significant impact.
1.15.8.2.1. Con: There will be more than two parties
1.16. Score voting \(aka Range voting\) — rate every candidate, highest-rated wins. Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting) and here: [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3GFG0sXIig)
1.16.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.16.2. Con: -> See 1.12.1.
1.16.3. Pro: Score Voting is the the system used by Kialo for determining the strongest argument, thus it has the endorsement of the host of these debates.
1.16.4. Pro: Honest Score Voting is the best possible voting system from a utilitarian perspective.
1.16.5. Pro: Largely retains the positive points of FPTP
1.16.5.1. Pro: Score Voting is [precinct-summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion).
1.16.5.2. Pro: Stronger Constituent Links than FPTP:  It preserves the single-member constituencies, and a scored ballot lets the winner see a detailed breakdown of all of their constituents' politics.
1.16.5.3. Pro: Cheap Elections: Score Voting uses the same single-round local count that makes FPTP so cheap
1.16.5.3.1. Con: Cost of implementation, while important, is of diminishing importance as automated methods are found to administer the vote.
1.16.5.3.2. Con: Cost of implementation is less important than the performance dynamics of the system.
1.16.5.4. Pro: Party Agnostic: It keeps the same separation between the party system and voting system that FPTP does.
1.16.5.5. Pro: Voting systems are under constant reform, in terms of boundaries, enfranchisement, secret balloting, campaigning restrictions, voting machines. Using a Score Ballot would be no more radical reform than these, as it largely preserves the features of FPTP such as single-member constituencies, and single-round local count, and the selection of the candidate with the largest total.
1.16.6. Pro: Score Voting eliminates the need for primary elections.
1.16.6.1. Pro: Only needing one election per seat should save tax dollars.
1.16.7. Con: When voters use the full range for their scores, Score is biased unfairly in favor of candidates who are surrounded by other candidates in opinion space, even if this is far from the center of voter preferences. \(See [comment on Animated Voting Methods​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA&lc=Ugg99fyetoWS_3gCoAEC.8TsiPckd7Xq8Tsm5UzJpk0).\)
1.16.7.1. Con: This bias only exists in models that assume a level of tactical voting far higher than is present in any empirical evidence, and is not consistent with the fact that the expressive voter model is the leading model of voting behaviour, not the pivotal model.
1.16.7.2. Con: Selecting moderates may be preferable to selecting extremists, and the resultant swing between poles, especially in single winner contests.
1.16.7.2.1. Con: These "moderates" are moderate relative to the other candidates; not moderate relative to the voters.  This may unfairly favor extremists from the electorate's perspective.
1.16.7.2.1.1. Con: Such candidates as can win a Score vote are likely not actually extremist, simply not dictated by the majority \(see the [Pizza Scenario\)](https://leastevil.blogspot.com/2012/03/tyranny-of-majority-weak-preferences.html)
1.16.7.3. Con: Informal surveys such as [this](https://kieron6.typeform.com/report/YwA3ws/eKme) and [the British Election Study](http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data/)'s party ratings as well as these more direct studies indicate that the majority of voters do not use the full range so this would not be an issue. [French2007studies](http://rangevoting.org/French2007studies.html) [OrsayTable](http://rangevoting.org/OrsayTable.html) [electology.org](https://electology.org/blog/honest-voters-had-preference-2016)
1.16.7.3.1. Con: Since voters and parties have mastered strategy for FPtP, we can expect them to master strategy for any new system put in place. For Score, this would entail using full range as a matter of course. Surveys don't have the benefit of dealing with a system that has been in place for a time and that affects contentious decisions.
1.16.7.4. Pro: While voters may not use the full range in general, polarising/extremist candidates would likely elicit not just the full range usage, but also min-max exaggeration. Can be seen in [this survey](https://kieron6.typeform.com/report/YwA3ws/eKme) in which the BNP received min-scores far in excess of any other party even after accounting for the left-leaning nature of the respondents.
1.16.8. Pro: Score voting encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters.
1.16.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.9.2.
1.16.9. Pro: Score voting is immune to the [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect).
1.16.9.1. Con: The voting system may be immune in theory to the spoiler effect, but in practice, voters may act in such a way that a candidate is still a spoiler.
1.16.9.1.1. Con: There is little to no strategic reason for voters to act in that way, and if they do once, they will learn from that and vote differently next time.
1.16.9.1.1.1. Pro: Voters should always give their first choice the maximum rating, and then give their preferred frontrunner a score depending on how much they want to risk electing their worst candidate.
1.16.9.2. Pro: Because of this, 3rd party candidates aren't discouraged from participating.
1.16.9.2.1. Pro: This also applies to Party Internal challengers who fear splitting their party's vote.
1.16.9.3. Pro: Cardinal Voting systems have a [Nursery Effect](http://rangevoting.org/NurseryEffect.html) that helps 3rd Parties become viable.
1.16.10. Pro: Score voting is quite simple and straightforward.
1.16.10.1. Pro: Score Voting has a built-in "None of the Above" option: Giving 0 scores to all candidates.
1.16.10.1.1. Con: Without a "minimum support threshold" or similar, giving all candidates minimum scores does not have meaningful impact, even if a majority does so.
1.16.10.2. Pro: Very little opportunity for [invalid ballots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoilt_vote).
1.16.10.2.1. Con: In the 2017 Green Party of Utah elections, [9 out of 34 ballots \(26%\)](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2eb2bc_e2f2d7cbefa34669bd006c2d7c79e109.pdf) had extra marks on them, indicating the voter had changed their mind or made a mistake.
1.16.10.2.2. Pro: Score voting reduces the ballot spoilage rate by a 3rd \(Source: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q_eMUGCU5U\))\)
1.16.10.3. Pro: Limits Tactical Voting: There's no more choosing between voting for your favourite or voting for a viable candidate.
1.16.10.3.1. Pro: [The leading model](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/spenkuch/research/voting.pdf) of voting behaviour is the Expressive model, not the Pivotal model. This indicates Score Voting would have near zero tactical voting, as honest votes are maximally expressive.
1.16.10.3.1.1. Pro: [This paper](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~nuff0084/FisherTT.pdf) analysing tactical voting in the UK shows that it is unrelated to marginality, and after accounting for selection bias of low turnout contention of 3rd parties are also a non-factor. Indicating tactical voting is not related to casting a pivotal vote.
1.16.10.3.1.2. Pro: [The paradox of voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting) shows that as voters are rational actors under the pivotal voter model, they wouldn't turnout to vote
1.16.10.3.1.3. Pro: [The evidence](http://gruener.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/user_upload/gruener/pdf/D_Mueller_TacticalVoting.pdf) shows that voters aren't tactical voting in line with tactical voting guide saying "keep the Tories out".
This prompting does create behaviour but it isn't behaviour in line with the pivotal voter model.
1.16.10.3.2. Pro: True honesty is often closer to the strategically optimal vote than the min-maxing a tactical voter would use: [www.rangevoting.org](http://www.rangevoting.org/RVstrat.ps.)
1.16.10.3.3. Pro: Empirical Evidence indicate voters choose to vote honestly when using Score Voting. \[[1](http://rangevoting.org/French2007studies.html)\]\[[2](http://rangevoting.org/OrsayTable.html)\]\[[3](https://electology.org/blog/honest-voters-had-preference-2016)\]\[[4](http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data/)\]
1.16.10.3.4. Pro: [Simulations](http://www.rangevoting.org/RVstrat3.html) indicate that honest voting is worth at least 2/3x a strategic vote. Compare FPTP where a vote for anyone but the top 2 is worth 0x a strategic vote in a marginal seat, or nothing at all in a safe seat.
1.16.10.3.5. Pro: Cardinal Voting systems [guarantee](http://scorevoting.net/FBCsurvey.html) it is never favourable to betray your favourite candidate.
1.16.10.4. Pro: All the information processing steps in the tally except the last two steps, are linear \(involve only addition and multiplication\). \(The last two steps are the determination of the rankings of the candidates based on their totals, and the declaring of the winner.\)
1.16.10.5. Pro: Only one round of tallying is required by Score Voting.
1.16.11. Con: Score voting is vulnerable to [bullet voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_voting).
1.16.11.1. Con: Bullet voting is a worse strategy than honest voting with enough viable candidates, and Score Voting is conducive to a large number of viable candidates.
1.16.11.2. Con: There is scientific evidence that people trend towards "ethical, expressive" voting when the numbers of voters in an election are large.  As such, Bullet Voting and Min/Max voting are both unlikely in real world elections.  See: [Feddersen et al 2009](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/moral-bias-in-large-elections-theory-and-experimental-evidence/F264CE61DE4F7BD6CED899A6EBA4DF11)
1.16.11.3. Con: Bullet-voting is rare in real-world Score Voting elections.
1.16.11.3.1. Pro: In the 2017 Green Party of Utah elections, [there were zero bullet votes](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2eb2bc_e2f2d7cbefa34669bd006c2d7c79e109.pdf).
1.16.11.3.2. Pro: In a [2018 straw poll](https://www.counted.vote/diving_into_our_straw_poll_data_bullet_anti_voting) in Washington's 10th Congressional District, only 11% of voters bullet-voted on their Score ballots.
1.16.11.3.3. Con: In [the 2015 Republican Liberty Caucus straw poll](https://electowiki.org/wiki/2015_Republican_Liberty_Caucus_straw_poll#Score_election), 44% of voters bullet-voted on their Score ballots.
1.16.11.3.3.1. Con: 44% is not even half of all voters. More than half of the voters did not bullet-vote.
1.16.11.4. Con: This is not a problem. Bullet voting is the voter's right if she judges it strategically best for promoting her values.
1.16.12. Con: Score Voting fails the [later-no-harm criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later-no-harm_criterion).
1.16.12.1. Con: No voting system permits both Honest First Choice and Honest Second Choice to always be strategically optimal according to the [Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem](http://rangevoting.org/LNH.html). Uniquely Score Voting ensures Honest First Choices & Semi-Honest Second Choices are strategically optimal.
1.16.12.1.1. Con: the simple Ranked-Order Ballot does not harm your first choice, by simply ranking your second choice.  it is true that IRV has harmed some voters' political interest by *helping* their least favorite candidate simply by marking their first choice as #1 instead of elevating their #2 to first choice.  but that's different.
1.16.12.1.2. Con: Asset permits both Honest First Choice and Honest Second Choice, so long as voters choose candidates with the same second preferences as them, because if their candidate can't win, they'll transfer their votes to the secondary preferences of the voters instead, helping them to win.
1.16.12.2. Pro: Score voting forces the voter to vote tactically by presenting the voter an initial question of how much should they score their second-choice candidate. Too high of a score means that their second-choice might beat their first-choice and too low of a score means their third-choice might beat their second-choice.
1.16.12.2.1. Con: This "problem" creates an incentive to vote honestly, which compounds the extant trend towards "ethical self expression" in found in [Feddersen et al. 2009](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/moral-bias-in-large-elections-theory-and-experimental-evidence/F264CE61DE4F7BD6CED899A6EBA4DF11)
1.16.12.2.2. Con: A voter giving their second-choice candidate a high score implies that they won't mind too much if their second-choice beats their first.  This is not a terrible scenario to them and there is thus not that much incentive to strategize.
1.16.12.2.3. Con: Without certainty about how others are going to vote, this implies that an honest ballot is actually the best strategy.
1.16.12.2.4. Con: ["A sincere score voting ballot has about 91% \(or more\) of the effectiveness of a perfectly strategic vote \(in the 3-candidate study; 80% or more in the 5-candidate case\), and it requires essentially no thought and no math."​](https://electology.org/score-voting-threshold-strategy)
1.16.12.2.5. Pro: Voters will not like cardinal systems because of the dilemma of having to help their secondary preferences beat their first preferences.
1.16.12.2.5.1. Con: The second-choice risk is counterbalanced by the risk of you missing out on an opportunity to have your second choice beat a worse candidate.
1.16.12.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.16.12.2.2.
1.16.12.3. Con: Later No Harm implies that the system ignores much of your ballot and can thwart consensus candidates. Source: FPTP and IRV.
1.16.12.3.1. Pro: In other words, systems that fail later-no-harm can sometimes lead to compromise, sometimes to vote-splitting, but systems that pass it never lead to compromise.
1.16.13. Pro: Makes every voter a swing voter, as getting voters to change their scores is far easier than changing their favourites.
1.16.14. Pro: Addresses many of the factors reducing voter turnout.
1.16.14.1. Pro: Score Voting increases election competition [which increases turnout](http://www.rangevoting.org/StudiesTurnout.html). [\[2\]](https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1042&context=wwu_honors)
1.16.14.1.1. Pro: [Cardinal Voting makes](https://medium.com/\@Googolbyte/60-of-seats-were-decided-before-a-single-vote-was-cast-we-need-electoral-reform-efa73aea7cea) every seat very marginal and increases the number of viable candidates to 3+, which increases election competitiveness.
1.16.14.2. Pro: [The viability of 3rd parties has a big effect on the turnout of 3rd party supporters](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~nuff0084/FisherTT.pdf). The lack of a Spoiler Effect, and presence of a Nursery Effect would increase turnout among 3rd party supporters
1.16.14.3. Pro: Suppression of voter turnout based on demographic differences between viable candidates would be less successful with Score Voting, as parties main competitors would be similar parties.
1.16.14.4. Pro: It's a single-round election system so there's no concern over decreased turnout for runoff rounds.
1.16.14.5. Pro: Under the Expressive Voter model of Voting Behaviour, voters go to the polls to express themselves. Therefore as Score Voting is highly expressive, it would increase turnout.
1.16.14.6. Pro: [Political trust/satisfaction impacts voter turnout](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110113). Bayesian Regret models show Score Voting minimises voter dissatisfaction with the result, which should in turn increase turnout.
1.16.14.7. Pro: The validity of a blank ballot \(all zero scores\) as a protest vote means turning out to vote for no one isn't a waste, increasing turnout among those who dislike all candidates.
1.16.14.7.1. Pro: This also undermines the objection to compulsory voting that voters who don't want to vote would just protest vote, as that is a valid form of voting within Score Voting.
1.16.14.8. Pro: As Score Voting is [precinct-summable](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Summability_criterion), the costs associated with making voting more accessible to voters is minimal.
1.16.15. Pro: In simulations, Score Voting produces higher [Voter Satisfaction Efficiency](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/vse.html) than any other system when voters are 100% strategic.
1.16.16. Pro: [Eliminates safe seats](https://medium.com/\@Googolbyte/60-of-seats-were-decided-before-a-single-vote-was-cast-we-need-electoral-reform-efa73aea7cea), giving voters more choice.
1.16.16.1. Pro: As Score Voting has No Vote-Splitting, even ideological polarised constituencies can be competitive with the same/similar parties putting multiple candidates on the ballot.
1.16.16.2. Pro: The Nursery Effect, would help new and emerging parties increase the number of competitive candidates on the ballot further reducing the number of safe seats.
1.16.16.2.1. Con: The Nursery Effect may be too fast, leading to politicians attempting to undermine, threaten, and repeal the system.
1.16.16.2.1.1. Con: Politicians elected under any system will want to keep that system. Once Score Voting elects a new government, that government will be biased towards Score Voting.
1.16.16.2.1.1.1. Pro: Some of the newly elected candidates will have perhaps unseated a corrupt incumbent of the same party, or be not that wealthy, or be running alongside others with similar ideology. Those types of candidates flourish with Score, not FPTP.
1.16.16.3. Pro: Even with a busier ballot, Score Voting still allows voters to make a clear-cut choice between the two main parties.
1.16.16.4. Pro: Undermining safe seats, makes gerrymandering more difficult if not impossible.
1.16.16.4.1. Con: The reduction in gerrymandering is overstated. SV would only address one of the principal gerrymandering tactics: "[cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Tactics)". The other tactics would be left unchecked.
1.16.16.5. Pro: Absent of both the spoiler effect and [candidate cloning effect](http://rangevoting.org/CandCloneSumm.html). Score Voting would allow voters to vote for people not parties. The same person could put multiple parties on the ballot and vice versa.
1.16.17. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.1.
1.16.18. Pro: Score voting meets the [favorite betrayal criterion](https://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Favorite_Betrayal_criterion), so it is always strategically safe to give your true favorite candidate the highest score on your ballot.
1.16.19. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.
1.16.20. Pro: Since many voters' small adjustments in scores for a candidate sum into large changes in overall score, and since it allows many similar candidates to run simultaneously, Score voting makes polling and prediction of winners volatile/uncertain, which in turn makes strategic voting more difficult/dangerous, and encourages honest voting.
1.16.21. Con: Score voting is vulnerable to strategic exaggeration
1.16.21.1. Con: In a [2018 straw poll](https://www.counted.vote/diving_into_our_straw_poll_data_min_max_voting) in Washington's 10th Congressional District, less than 18% of voters used min/max voting or bullet-voting on their Score ballots.
1.16.21.1.1. Con: If Score Voting were actually used for real-world results \(not just hypothetical poll questions\), people would learn that minmax voting is more powerful than honest voting, and the percentage would go up.
1.16.21.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.11.1.
1.16.21.2. Con: This is not a problem. It is the voter's right to exaggerate, should the voter so choose.
1.16.22. Pro: No [Wasted Votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote) as Score Voting has voters score every candidate individually, ensuring their vote counts towards the winner.
1.16.22.1. Con: The most common definition of a wasted vote makes the concept of wasted voting very difficult to apply to alternative voting methods like score voting.
1.16.22.2. Con: Score Voting only eliminates "wasted losing votes". Extra winning votes would be considered wasted.
1.16.22.2.1. Con: One could argue that my vote for the winner also helped push back some candidates that did not win and I gave low scores to.
1.16.23. Pro: [Ka-Ping Yee Simulations](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/) show that Cardinal Voting has no underlying bias towards extremism or centrism.
1.16.23.1. Con: Yee's simulations assume 100% honest voting, without even normalization.  With normalization, Score voting is biased towards "centrists" \(relative to the other candidates\).  [rangevoting.org](http://rangevoting.org/Extremism.html) [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4FXLQoLDBA)
1.16.24. Pro: Strong Governance: [Simulations of GE2017](https://imgur.com/a/U2O1T) show it would've produced a one-party majority when FPTP failed to.
1.16.24.1. Pro: Coalition Governments can be strong and stable, Large Parties are just coalitions of factions in the first place.
1.16.25. Con: Score may take out the two-party system so quickly that higher-up politicians outlaw and repeal it.
1.16.25.1. Pro: Approval Voting would likely be slower than Score Voting at eroding two-party domination
1.16.25.1.1. Pro: With Score Voting, voters can give the mainstream candidates slightly less than full score, making it a little easier for third parties and independents to win.
1.16.25.2. Pro: Republican IRV opponents in Maine sued and attempted to repeal that; what happens when both parties dislike the system?
1.16.25.3. Con: There is little point in reform if it does not quickly end two-party domination.
1.16.25.3.1. Con: If the voters actually want two-party domination, they should be allowed to have it.
1.16.25.3.1.1. Con: Voters don't want two-party domination.
1.16.25.3.1.1.1. Con: The problem is that there's a logical contradiction between what voters want \(majority rule\) and the outcome \(favorite betrayal failures, and the perpetuation of two-party domination\)
1.16.25.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.4.1.
1.16.25.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Not all voting methods that satisfy some variant of majority rule have Favorite Betrayal issues.
1.16.25.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Most of the ones that do are too complicated to explain/advocate in public campaigns.
1.16.25.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.16.26. Pro: [The risk of ties](http://rangevoting.org/TieRisk.html) under Cardinal Voting systems is very low, avoiding the expenses associated with recounts and lawsuits.
1.16.27. Pro: Allows voters to fully express their political voice, as they can independently score each candidate.
1.16.27.1. Pro: It allows the clear expression of tied or close preferences between two candidates, unlike most other voting systems.
1.16.27.2. Con: Requiring voters to rate candidates forces an undesirable tactical decision on voters immediately in the voting booth.  How high should they rate their 2nd-choice candidate?  Too high will hurt their favorite or 1st-choice.  Insufficiently high will hurt their 2nd-choice against their 3rd-choice in the case that their favorite turns out not to be contending.
1.16.27.3. Pro: The [Paradox of voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting) shows that voters go to the polls for self-expression not self-interest, so using a voting system that maximizes expression is imperative.
1.16.27.4. Pro: Informal surveys such as [this](https://kieron6.typeform.com/report/YwA3ws/eKme) and the [British Election Study](http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data/)'s party ratings as well as these more direct studies indicate that voters use the expressiveness of a cardinal ballot to its fullest. [French2007studies](http://rangevoting.org/French2007studies.html) [OrsayTable](http://rangevoting.org/OrsayTable.html) [electology.org](https://electology.org/blog/honest-voters-had-preference-2016)
1.16.28. Pro: Assuming that voters don't highly score the worst candidate after the introduction of a non-viable even-worse candidate, Cardinal Voting systems will always elect the Condorcet winner. [Simulations](http://scorevoting.net/StratHonMix.html) also indicate that they are the most effective means of electing Condorcet winners even with strategic voters.
1.16.29. Pro: Score voting should decrease the importance of money in elections, as argued by Warren D. Smith at [the cash3 link](https://rangevoting.org/Cash3.html).
1.16.30. Pro: Score Voting provides equality of power among the voters, as evidenced by the fact that Score meets the Frohnmayer balance constraint, i. e. that every possible vote in the system has a balancing vote that is also permitted.
1.16.30.1. Pro: Systems without Frohnmayer balance are anti-democratic in the sense that "one person, one vote" is violated in spirit if the votes are not weighted equally.
1.16.30.2. Pro: Unbalanced systems dilute power by splitting votes.
1.16.30.3. Pro: Logic behind the significance of the balance constraint as an indicator of equality of power: Suppose a number of voters have already voted but voters A and B have not. A votes and changes the outcome of the election. Can B's vote change it back? If not, the system has accorded more power to A's vote than to B's, since A was able to move the needle, but B's power did not suffice to move it back.
1.16.30.3.1. Con: If B can always undo what A does then they are potentially equal, although in practice B's actual vote may not be equal. But if B can't undo A's vote, and C can't undo B's vote, that does not prove that B's vote is unequal to A's vote.
1.16.31. Pro: [Bayesian Regret](http://rangevoting.org/BayRegDum.html) models indicate it minimises the number of "sore losers" \(which should be preferable for those who call voting reformers sore losers\)
1.16.32. Pro: It holds a long history of successful use.
1.16.32.1. Pro: A 3-option version of SV is used to elect the [Secretary-General of the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary-General_selection,_2016).
1.16.32.2. Con: No government has used Score with a 5 or 10-point scale, which is what most Score advocates favor.
1.16.32.3. Pro: [Honeybees](http://rangevoting.org/ApisMellifera.html) have used a Cardinal Voting system for 20-50 millions years
1.16.32.3.1. Con: Claiming that bee communication is "voting" is very far-fetched.
1.16.32.4. Pro: [Ancient Sparta](http://rangevoting.org/SpartaBury.html) used a Cardinal Voting system for over 1000 years. Potentially the record holder for longest continual use of a voting system of any Government.
1.16.32.4.1. Con: This is not a true score voting system, but a shouting match, which the "party" with the loudest "voters" won, even if there were not as many people in that "party".
1.16.32.4.1.1. Con: The same "fewer but more passionate" principle applies to a scenario where 40% vote their candidate 9 while 60% vote their candidate 5 \(averaging 3.6 vs 3.0\)
1.16.32.5. Pro: [The Venetian Empire](http://rangevoting.org/VenHist.html) used a 3-point Range Voting system for over 500 years, potentially making it the 2nd-longest continual user of a voting system of any Government.
1.16.32.5.1. Pro: This use continued until Napoleon conquered Venice.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_of_Venice#The_last_Doge)
1.16.32.6. Con: The implementation of Cardinal Voting in the 3 years prior to the collapse of the [Soviet Union](http://rangevoting.org/SovietApp.html) empowered local leaders contributing to its collapse.
1.16.32.6.1. Con: Empowering the electorate and local leadership only destabilizes governments that do not reflect the wishes of those empowered groups.
1.16.32.7. Pro: Olympics have used Range Voting for over 100 years to select winners. A temporary switch to IRV in [1995](http://rangevoting.org/OlympBonaly.html) caused embarrassment and outrage, leading to the re-adoption of the Cardinal System.
1.16.33. Pro: Score [works](https://www.rangevoting.org/VMSumm.html) with existing voting machines.
1.16.33.1. Con: -> See 1.7.15.3.1.1.
1.16.33.2. Con: -> See 1.7.15.3.1.2.
1.17. Combined approval voting \(aka Evaluative Voting, Dis&approval voting\) Described here: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_approval_voting)
1.17.1. Pro: [CAV is compatible with existing ballots and voting machines that support ballot initiatives.](https://www.rangevoting.org/OssipoffEnd.html)
1.17.2. Con: The coarseness of the scale can lead to unrepresentative outcomes.
1.17.2.1. Con: Voters can use randomness \(coins, dice, computers, etc\) to work around the problem of a coarse ballot if the number of voters is large.
1.17.2.1.1. Pro: Party officials can do the random process and distribute the results to loyal adherents.
1.17.2.1.2. Con: This may be impractical for voters, as they must either bring the randomizer into the voting booth \(which is time-consuming and people may forget\) or do it at home \(and thus have to remember\).
1.17.2.1.2.1. Con: The voter can run the random process at home, write the result on a scrap of paper, and carry that into the booth.
1.17.2.1.2.2. Con: It is very common for people to carry coins in their pockets wherever they go in public. It is unlikely any polity would outlaw carrying coins into the voting booth.
1.17.2.1.3. Con: Voters may not like the idea of throwing their vote to chance, and they may decide not to do this.
1.17.2.1.3.1. Con: Experience shows that when a voting system has been in effect for a time, the people learn a fairly good strategy to use with that system. For example, with FPtP, people discourage some potential candidates from running on the grounds that they could become "spoilers" for a compromise candidate. So it stands to reason that people will learn that randomization is a good strategy for Approval.
1.17.2.1.3.1.1. Con: However, learning strategy for coarse versions of Score will take longer than learning strategy for sufficiently fine versions.
1.17.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.17.2.1.3.1.1.
1.17.3. Pro: It can be used as a temporary transition to 10-value Score Voting if a particular precinct does not have the resources to adopt Score Voting for a few years.
1.17.4. Con: Unknown lunatics can win if people mostly leave them blank and the front runners have under 40-50% approval.
1.17.4.1. Con: If the front runner has more disapproval than approval, maybe it's right for an unknown lunatic to win instead.
1.17.4.2. Con: People won't leave the unknown lunatics blank. People will learn to enter full opposition to such. My evidence is that under FPtP, people have learned the strategy of discouraging others from running on the grounds of their becoming spoilers. If people can learn such a sophisticated strategy while a given voting system was in use, they can also learn strategies for a new system, which for the one in question, would entail opposing unknown candidates fully.
1.17.4.2.1. Con: Write-in candidates have to be given a default value, as most people will not even think to write in every single name negatively, if such a move is even possible.
1.17.5. Con: Extremists tend to disapprove at a higher rate than other voters, giving them more power simply because they took the time to do more marking.
1.17.6. Pro: This system appeals to people who want an explicit way to oppose a given candidate.
1.18. Negative Vote, described here: [www.negativevote.org](https://www.negativevote.org/pagesen/pid_12/2.html?lang=en)
1.18.1. Pro: Research has shown it will [increase voter participation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6tauXJgLoM&t=137s).
1.18.1.1. Pro: Changing an entire electoral system can be a complicated process. The negative vote option allows for the option to amend the existing system.
1.18.2. Pro: Negative Vote allows those of the electorate who would otherwise spoil their ballot or not vote, to make a meaningful contribution to election results, in the form of a vote against their least preferred candidate.
1.18.3. Con: If negative votes against a most-hated opponent are cast in numbers comparable to positive votes for favorites, all of the well-known candidates lose and a dark horse wins instead.
1.18.4. Con: Allowing voters to only express an opinion about one candidate leads to vote-splitting and unrepresentative outcomes.
1.18.5. Pro: Roughly twice as expressive as FPTP, due to the added "negative" option.
1.18.5.1. Con: Most other voting methods are still far more expressive than negative vote.
1.18.5.2. Con: Voters can still only express an opinion on one candidate.
1.18.5.2.1. Pro: If there are four candidates, Negative Vote prevents a voter from exercising her right to support two of the candidates and oppose the other two. \(not only does "vote for OR against" do this, but "vote for AND against" also suffers from this drawback, and it is maybe the next more expressive balanced system than negative vote\).
1.18.6. Con: Negative Vote arguably degrades to FPtP. Suppose there is a plethora of candidates that hardly anyone knows about, or that many voters actively oppose. The “against” options outnumber the "for" options, causing a potential "against" vote to be diluted. Therefore, voters are encouraged to vote “for”. As everyone votes “for”, the system has devolves to FPtP. [\[\@Marylander\]](https://forum.electionscience.org/t/international-support-for-approval-voting/176/11)
1.18.6.1. Con: This complaint is one-sided. It can degrade to either FPTP or anti-FPTP or a mix of the two depending on the circumstances.
1.18.6.1.1. Pro: An example for anti-FPtP: if a voter is presented with a small number \(1-2\) of candidates they dislike, and a relatively large number \(3+\) of candidates they like, voting an "against" aimed at one of the disliked candidates is would have a greater impact towards the voter's desired outcome.
1.19. [Asset Voting](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Asset_voting) \(candidates trade votes\) Also described [here](https://www.rangevoting.org/Asset.html)
1.19.1. Con: The major parties may restrict ballot access for minor parties, making it impossible to vote for them.
1.19.1.1. Con: That's true in any system where parties can be distinguished.
1.19.1.2. Pro: Imagine with Asset Voting for a single candidate, that the major parties have a private agreement that they will not negotiate with minor parties. Then the minor parties are shut out and can do nothing unless together they get the plurality of votes.
1.19.1.2.1. Pro: Collusion of the majors against the minors has already happened, and in more than one arena.
1.19.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the US, the major parties took over the presidential debate stage, previously staged by the League of Women Voters. The majors created and run the "Commission on Presidential Debates", which sets high bars for third-party or independent participation.
1.19.1.2.1.2. Pro: From their positions of power in state legislatures, major-party politicians have enacted laws that require third-party and independent candidates to collect many petition signatures, but the laws do not place the same requirements on candidates of the major parties.
1.19.1.2.2. Con: Voters can then decide not to give votes at all to the major parties, which will give minor parties a plurality.
1.19.1.2.3. Con: Candidates with similar ideologies to the major parties can run and split votes, and then refuse to give those votes to the majors.
1.19.1.3. Pro: Imagine with single-winner Asset voting, that a minor party gets enough votes to swing the winner from one major party to the other. They ask for concessions. Both major parties bid for it, offering more and more until one has to drop out. If they are honest and actually do what they promised, the minor party gets A WHOLE LOT, way more than they should.
1.19.1.3.1. Con: If the major party isn't honest, the minor party will not have a meaningful way of receiving and using votes to punish the major party in the next election.
1.19.1.3.1.1. Con: It will always be possible, and perhaps beneficial, to write in your candidate.
1.19.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Conniving politicians and courts can even remove write-ins on the grounds that they're too difficult to count.
1.19.1.3.1.2. Con: If there is a single major party that runs things, or if the two major parties collude, they can cheat ANY voting system. Not just Asset voting.
1.19.1.4. Con: -> See 1.19.1.3.1.1.
1.19.1.5. Con: Score Voting or any other good method coupled with Optional Delegation \(or not\) would have a stronger claim against ballot access restriction.
1.19.2. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1.
1.19.3. Pro: Allows voters to pick 3rd party and independent candidates without wasting votes.
1.19.3.1. Con: -> See 1.19.1.
1.19.3.2. Con: Minor candidates might not trade votes the way their voters want them to, which would "waste" their votes
1.19.3.2.1. Con: It's unlikely for voters to even pick minor candidates unless they're confident the said candidate will trade the way they want them to.
1.19.3.2.2. Pro: Voters will not know minor candidates well enough to know how they will vote.
1.19.3.2.2.1. Con: If the voters don't know how the candidate might trade, they will probably also not know what the candidate is in favor of, and so would likely not vote for that candidate at all.
1.19.4. Pro: Allows voters to pick non-candidates \(electors\) who can focus on researching and negotiating with candidates on the voters' behalf.
1.19.4.1. Pro: This solves for voter [rational ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance) and [monitoring costs](https://definedterm.com/monitoring_costs), because voters can have political proxies with enough votes to be incentivized to ensure the government and candidates are honest.
1.19.4.2. Pro: Minorities can unite behind one candidate with enough votes to swing elections and make demands.
1.19.4.2.1. Con: This could get out of hand, leading to extreme disharmony.
1.19.4.2.1.1. Con: Only minority candidates with requests that are somewhat in sync with the majority could do anything, because a majority of votes is necessary to elect a winner under Asset.
1.19.4.2.1.2. Con: **This is single-winner Asset**. A candidate needs a majority of votes to win, and those votes ultimately have to come from the people.
1.19.4.2.2. Pro: This could lead to the destruction of the two-party system, and a total renewal of politics.
1.19.4.3. Pro: Hence, Asset allows proxies without getting rid of the secret ballot, because voters' votes are their proxies.
1.19.5. Pro: Asset \(in its simplest version\) only lets voters pick one candidate, which forces them to focus on what they really want.
1.19.5.1. Con: Allowing more voter expressiveness is a good thing, because it lets voters have a say on every candidate.
1.19.5.1.1. Pro: The more voters can express on every candidate, the more control they have over the election.
1.19.5.1.1.1. Con: The more the voters can express, the more they have to express, which reduces their desire to deliberate and consider what's best.
1.19.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Even in systems that empower voters who study and deliberate, voters who don't want to deliberate can still bullet vote.
1.19.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Those voters may wish to have a less deliberative system, where their lack of deliberation doesn't harm their impact over the election.
1.19.5.1.1.1.2. Con: If the voter evaluates only candidates that pass some easy filters that that voter uses \(replacing today's money filter\), and votes against all the candidates the voter chose not to evaluate, the voter still has an equal vote.
1.19.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: For example, a pro-gun voter in a 9-candidate Approval race need only look at each candidate's stance on guns, and approve those that agree with said voter. \(Replace "guns" with any other pertinent issue.\)
1.19.6. Con: Voters can't choose who their votes are given to, which makes Asset less democratic and secure than deterministic \(ballot-only\) voting systems.
1.19.6.1. Con: There are variants of Asset \("Optional Asset Voting"\) where voters can choose whether or not their vote can be traded, which partially solves this issue.
1.19.6.1.1. Con: Those who choose not to transfer their vote gain a tactical advantage, because candidates with transferable votes will be forced to elect those on their side who can't transfer to them. Therefore, Optional Asset will have problems with cycles of cooperation and defection between factions.
1.19.6.1.2. Con: Optional Asset is somewhat pointless, because if a voter doesn't trust a candidate enough to trade their vote, they generally wouldn't have trusted that candidate with their vote at all.
1.19.6.1.3. Con: The more people choose not to allow their vote to be transferred, the greater the chance of wasted votes and vote-splitting.
1.19.6.2. Pro: Candidates may misinterpret who their voters want them to give their votes to.
1.19.6.2.1. Con: Most candidates are far more capable than this.
1.19.6.2.2. Con: Voters will be discerning enough not to pick bad candidates like these.
1.19.6.3. Pro: Not every voter who agrees on first-preference will agree on secondary preferences, so a candidate may give a voter's vote to a candidate that was not that voter's own preference for the trade.
1.19.6.3.1. Con: Voters will be aware of when their candidates' secondary preferences differ from their own, because they'll be paying attention to campaign rhetoric, and so they will be careful not to give their vote to candidates who diverge with them unless those candidates have a realistic chance of winning.
1.19.6.3.2. Pro: Politicians hide things and lie to voters all the time, so they could just as easily lie about who the voter's vote will go to.
1.19.6.3.3. Con: If the candidate trades in a way that a voter doesn't like, then they likely would have governed similarly, and so the voter is better off having a candidate who only traded votes badly, rather than governed badly.
1.19.6.3.3.1. Con: Not necessarily. The RDO \(representative denied office\) could pass on proxy to a winner who governs badly.
1.19.6.3.3.1.1. Con: That winner would need a majority of votes. One RDO cannot do that singlehandedly, since an RDO by definition does not have a majority.
1.19.6.3.3.1.1.1. Con: One RDO might have the swing votes necessary to tilt a winner into office.
1.19.6.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that the winner had a near-majority of votes in the first place means they were most likely evaluated to be good by several candidates across the political spectrum.
1.19.6.4. Con: Voters will only pick candidates whom they trust to trade, which will, over time, ensure that only good people get the chance to trade votes.
1.19.6.5. Con: Voters can always just pick frontrunners who are likely to win, allowing them to circumvent the trading process most of the time.
1.19.6.5.1. Con: Picking the front-runner over a voter's preferred candidate leads to strategic voting a pulls Asset closer to Plurality.
1.19.6.6. Con: Voters can't choose what their candidate will do if they win either, but nobody calls that undemocratic.
1.19.7. Pro: Asset tends to elect moderates, because losing candidates would band together and compromise to beat the "winners" from the other party.
1.19.7.1. Con: If this were true, then it would happen regardless of the input of voters, and candidates could instead just be given an equal amount of votes to negotiate between themselves, with the same outcome.
1.19.7.1.1. Con: Not true, because a majority of votes is sufficient to elect a candidate; therefore if one side had a majority, they wouldn't elect the moderate.
1.19.7.1.1.1. Con: Politicians have incentives to try to climb the political ladder as fast as possible. As a result, they will not be held accountable by voters, and will attempt to sabotage the election results to force other electors to pick them.
1.19.7.2. Con: Moderates aren't good, because they don't accurately represent most people's views.
1.19.7.2.1. Con: Definitionally, moderates better represent most people's views when compared to non-moderates.
1.19.7.2.2. Con: But they are preferred by more people, because they don't attempt to dominate the losing minority in the same way that extremists do.
1.19.7.2.3. Con: Ideally, several different types of moderates will run, and only the best one \(as judged by the voters and candidates\) will win.
1.19.7.3. Pro: If neither side \(liberals and conservatives\) has a majority, then they must negotiate with the moderates to win, which would make them more moderate as well.
1.19.7.3.1. Con: They might find themselves negotiating with extremists instead of moderates.
1.19.7.3.2. Pro: Over time, extremists are likely to help elect moderates directly out of good faith and trust that the moderate will implement more of their policies than the opposition.
1.19.7.4. Con: If neither extremist has a majority, they'll have to make deals or support the moderate to avoid letting their rival edge them out.
1.19.7.4.1. Pro: This is something that Asset does much better than STV, because a moderate under STV can get eliminated before they have a chance to receive transfer votes.
1.19.7.5. Con: Asset Voting suffers from the [center squeeze effect](https://www.electionscience.org/library/the-center-squeeze-effect/), which will cause moderate candidates to drop out and transfer their votes to extremists.
1.19.8. Con: Requires a secure time and means after the election for the candidates to trade, which could be costly and uncertain.
1.19.8.1. Con: Providing a place \(like City Hall\) ought to be easy enough, and non-convening candidates can mail in or directly transmit their trading preferences through a local elections office.
1.19.8.2. Pro: Candidates might make mistakes in their trading decisions due to the means involved.
1.19.8.2.1. Con: Over time, if not immediately, voters would learn to not vote for candidates who are incompetent.
1.19.8.3. Pro: Asset violates [One Person, One Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_man,_one_vote), because the candidates have multiple votes to trade.
1.19.8.3.1. Con: Only candidates who have received the votes of the voters have multiple votes; because they are delegates or proxies, rather than simply voters, Asset doesn't contravene OPOV, which was designed to protect the equal weight of every voter's vote.
1.19.9. Con: Has never been used in formal contexts before.
1.19.9.1. Con: Asset has strong similarities to FPTP, so we can guess how well it might do based on our understanding of politicians and FPTP.
1.19.9.2. Con: Proxy Voting and delegable/liquid democracy are similar systems, and they've been used for decades without major issues.
1.19.9.2.1. Pro: Proxy Voting has been used satisfactorily in corporate governance for decades, and nobody is attempting to repeal it currently.
1.19.9.2.2. Pro: Google and other private organizations have experimented with forms of liquid democracy over the past few years with little negative feedback against the core concept.
1.19.10. Pro: Asset is one of the only systems that gives losing candidates power.
1.19.10.1. Con: Bad trading decisions could lead to candidates winning that are unfit for political office.
1.19.10.2. Pro: This power is proportional to the number of people who prefer them, which is the ideal of deliberative democracy.
1.19.10.2.1. Pro: The more people can freely identify with candidates regardless of winning or losing, the more they can focus on ideas rather than political strategy.
1.19.10.3. Con: This means that extremists will have a way to hijack the government.
1.19.10.3.1. Con: No, because the extremists will be roughly evenly divided on both sides, and so their demands and votes will "cancel out."
1.19.10.3.2. Con: The only reason extremists would "hijack the government" is if either they got many votes or they swung a close contest, but even in the latter case, it was only close because the main rivals had a significant vote share.
1.19.10.4. Con: This power could easily be abused. A candidate trading their assets for promises from the winner, for example. Thus Asset Voting has the potential for regular bribery and corruption.
1.19.10.4.1. Con: Bribery and corruption already exist in our current political system. Changing to Asset Voting would bring these issues into the open, where they could be effectively managed and dealt with.
1.19.10.4.1.1. Con: Any kind of corruption is serious, and Asset shouldn't be used if it allows for more corruption than other systems.
1.19.10.4.1.1.1. Pro: Because the candidates are trading votes, it will be easy for the ones with less votes to get away with corrupt trades.
1.19.10.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Candidates with fewer votes are more likely to have earned the trust of their voters, in which case those voters would likely pay close attention to how their votes impacted the final result.
1.19.10.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Candidates with more votes are better covered by media, and thus easier to monitor.
1.19.10.4.1.1.2. Con: A system that destroys corruption from the outset is one that will be destroyed by the corrupt immediately.
1.19.10.4.1.1.3. Con: It may technically allow for it, but voters would quickly adapt to this, since there is no vote-splitting.
1.19.10.4.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.19.1.
1.19.10.4.1.2. Con: Open corruption happens frequently and is not often punished, so bringing corruption into the open is not a guarantee that it will stop.
1.19.10.4.1.2.1. Con: Corrupt vote trading would be a very serious and publicized crime, and that kind of corruption gets punished quite often.
1.19.10.4.2. Pro: Such scandals could lead to repeal.
1.19.10.4.2.1. Pro: The repeal of non-status quo voting systems will lead to a lack of trust in voting reform.
1.19.10.4.2.2. Con: People will understand when politicians make mistakes, and will try to vote for better candidates in future elections.
1.19.10.4.2.3. Pro: Voters already distrust politicians, so they will go for anything that takes power away and punishes politicians.
1.19.10.4.2.3.1. Con: Asset is a "compromise" between the old guard of politicians and the people, and so people will be less likely to repeal Asset if they think it's the only way to get and keep voting reform.
1.19.10.4.3. Pro: The strong presence and impact of corruption would lead to Asset getting repealed.
1.19.10.4.3.1. Pro: The repeal of Asset due to corruption would forestall momentum for better voting systems.
1.19.11. Pro: Asset doesn't drastically change politics immediately.
1.19.11.1. Pro: Because voters are only picking their favorite candidate, as opposed to multiple, they will focus on what they truly want for society, rather than idly supporting candidates they know little about.
1.19.11.2. Pro: Score and Approval, and many other systems force liberal/conservative voters to pick moderates that they might not like to prevent the other side from winning, and this will lead to widespread dissatisfaction that traditional politicians can use to repeal.
1.19.11.2.1. Con: If you do not like the moderate, then you can just give them a lower score. This can weed out bad moderates and favor good ones.
1.19.12. Pro: Asset would likely lead to more majority winners.
1.19.12.1. Con: -> See 1.12.2.1.4.1.1.1.
1.19.12.2. Con: These would be artificial majorities. A true majoritarian winner is based on the first preferences of voters.
1.19.12.3. Con: These would be "fake majorities", because candidates, not voters, decide who wins.
1.19.12.3.1. Con: Yes, but those candidates can only decide who wins by first winning the trust and consent of the voters.
1.19.12.3.1.1. Con: No voting system can change the quality of political campaigns or the representatives of the public.
1.19.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: Voting systems can influence the quality of candidates. For example, FPtP discourages candidates having little money support from running, for fear of their splitting votes, but Score does not. And Asset would encourage people to run and argue for their policy positions because they could have influence even if they don't win the office.
1.19.12.3.1.1.2. Con: Because Asset eliminates the concept of wasted votes, it allows voters to pick non-frontrunners whom they may prefer, leading to better elections and deliberations.
1.19.12.4. Pro: This would give greater legitimacy and satisfaction to the election results.
1.19.13. Con: Has the least voter expressiveness \(vote for only one.\)
1.19.13.1. Pro: Less voter expressiveness is less democratic, because it weakens the ability of the people to express their thoughts on who should win.
1.19.13.1.1. Con: More voter expressiveness tends to force voters to evaluate multiple candidates, which reduces total time spent considering each candidate, thus reducing the deliberative aspects of an election.
1.19.13.1.2. Pro: Candidates who haven't been evaluated by most of the electorate shouldn't win.
1.19.13.1.2.1. Con: Many evaluative voting systems actually increase the chance of this happening, because voters may focus more on their most liked or most hated candidate and not look closely at the moderates who are likely to win.
1.19.13.1.2.1.1. Con: A less known candidate may win once, but voters will adapt and do better the next time.
1.19.13.2. Pro: Any "choose one" system is suspiciously too similar to FPtP. Maybe any such system will inherit some of the bad effects of FPtP.
1.19.13.2.1. Con: FPTP is comically bad at avoiding spoilers and allowing moderates to win. Asset is specifically designed to improve on FPTP, including by fixing the above two faults.
1.19.14. Con: Political extremists could win with practically no votes because other candidates decided to trade votes to them.
1.19.14.1. Con: If a candidate has practically no votes, what does he trade with other candidates so he can win?
1.19.14.2. Pro: Extremists wouldn't have to be evaluated by most of the electorate to win.
1.19.14.3. Con: Most candidates wouldn't give their votes to crazy candidates that their voters would hate.
1.19.14.3.1. Pro: Even the increased risk of an unknown crazy winning an election is too high to risk using Asset.
1.19.14.3.1.1. Con: Most two-party ending voting systems tend to increase the risk of unknown, potentially bad candidates winning, because voters may not pay as much attention to how they evaluate unknown candidates as they do to their most liked or most hated.
1.19.14.3.1.1.1. Con: The two parties can nominate bad candidates, and then voters have no choice but to pick between them.
1.19.14.3.1.1.2. Con: Most two-party ending systems can only elect a somewhat bad candidate because they were unknown; true crazies would be easily caught and stopped by the voters.
1.19.15. Pro: Asset voting would be easy to implement.
1.19.15.1. Con: The simplicity of a voting system should not be used to determine how good a voting system it is.
1.19.15.1.1. Con: Other things equal, simple systems are better than complicated systems. But other things are usually not equal.
1.19.15.2. Pro: Asset may be a more "viable" or good "compromise" system because it doesn't threaten mainstream politicians or the traditional thinking about voting \("vote for one"\) as sharply or strongly as other voting systems do in the short term.
1.19.15.2.1. Pro: Other voting systems that end two-party domination may do it so quickly that they get repealed and outlawed by the scared higher levels of government.
1.19.15.2.1.1. Con: The main challenge is getting the system used in the first place. Once that happens, the new governments are biased towards the new system, and will want to keep it.
1.19.15.3. Pro: Asset can work on current vote-counting machines, and is of minimal additional cost \(just give candidates a secure time and means to trade votes.\)
1.19.15.4. Pro: Has the least potential to confuse voters using FPTP on other parts of the ballot, because it's still vote-for-one.
1.19.15.4.1. Con: Voters using FPTP elsewhere on the ballot may continue to use FPTP strategy under Asset, entrenching two-party domination. A voting system with greater differences would be more likely to break such use of strategy.
1.19.15.4.1.1. Con: Voters generally decide on voting strategy long before they get to their ballot, and when a new voting system is implemented, voters will be implicitly aware due to all the new candidates and campaign discussions happening around them.
1.19.15.4.1.1.1. Con: But voters may pre-decide to use similar strategies to both elections, or else pre-decide to vote honestly in actual FPTP elections.
1.19.15.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Voters who prefer the major parties won't be able to pre-decide to vote honestly in FPTP most likely, as ballot access restrictions will make it clear that there is only one major-party candidate to pick from on either side.
1.19.15.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Third-party supporters may be fooled into picking third-parties in FPTP, or may avoid picking third-parties in Asset.
1.19.15.4.1.2. Con: This largely goes away if the vote is designed for a different type of vote, such as "distribute 12 votes among the candidates" or "vote for up to 5".
1.19.15.4.2. Pro: No other good voting system works well if voters only vote for one candidate.
1.19.15.5. Con: Asset's radical unconventionalness would make it difficult to implement.
1.19.15.6. Con: It has the complexity of having to manage the trading.
1.19.15.6.1. Con: It is simple enough to explain to voters. The "complexity" of actually managing the trading is just like the "complexity" of having to print ballots and count votes, which marketing can ignore.
1.19.16. Con: Candidates shouldn't have a special role in the voting process beyond running, winning, and losing.
1.19.16.1. Pro: We can't trust current candidates to govern properly, so they can't be trusted to trade our votes properly.
1.19.16.1.1. Con: If there's a candidate you don't trust to govern properly, don't vote for him in any voting system.
1.19.16.1.2. Con: Asset lets voters pick many more new, more trustworthy candidates, because their votes aren't "wasted" anymore.
1.19.16.1.2.1. Pro: This will gradually lead to better candidates deciding who wins.
1.19.16.1.3. Pro: Vote-trading would lead to backroom deals and legislative pork that has nothing to do with what voters want.
1.19.16.1.3.1. Con: Bad backroom deals are unlikely over time, because voters will only pick politicians that they trust.
1.19.16.1.3.1.1. Con: Voters currently pick politicians they trust, and that makes little difference in how badly those politicians act.
1.19.16.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The quality of FPTP politicians, who are often decided by "backroom deals" in party headquarters and donor meetings, can't be compared to alternative voting systems' politicians, because voters can choose freely among all candidates, not just traditional FPTP politicians.
1.19.16.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Not necessarily. Many voters under FPtP vote for people they don't trust at all, because they think the ones they are voting for have enough money to defeat someone the voter trusts _even less_. Example voting for Trump rather than for Stein to defeat HRC in the US. Or voting for HRC to defeat Trump.
1.19.16.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: [cash3](https://rangevoting.org/Cash3.html) by Warren D. Smith mentions an "inherent strategic need for candidates to expensively convince voters they are one of the '2 most likely to win' so that it is non-idiotic to vote for them".
1.19.16.1.3.2. Pro: Backroom deals would favor the status quo over the people.
1.19.16.1.3.2.1. Con: Retaining the potential for backroom deals is important, because it gives FPTP politicians a reason to support or at least not oppose Asset.
1.19.16.1.3.2.2. Con: Backroom deals are far less useful under Asset than FPTP, because politicians now have to work with members of other parties and independent candidates to get elected, rather than their own circles.
1.19.16.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Backroom deals are more public in Asset, giving the public a way to strongly "punish" candidates by picking new ones.
1.19.16.1.4. Con: The politicians who traded political and personal favors in the past were breeded by corrupt political circles and unchosen by the people, so they can't be compared to a system where people have free choice and candidates can come from anywhere.
1.19.16.1.5. Pro: Elections shouldn't be decided by deal-making, which ignores the will of the people, and is thus undemocratic.
1.19.16.1.5.1. Con: Currently, almost all laws and policies are done through deals. Due to Asset's other benefits, Asset deals may even fare better than current deals.
1.19.16.1.5.2. Con: Asset Voting democratically chooses who gets to make the deals, and the importance of their deals depends on how many votes they got.
1.19.16.2. Con: -> See 1.19.6.6.
1.19.17. Con: Asset can't be used in abstract scenarios \(such as ballot initiatives and referendums\)
1.19.17.1. Con: Asset can be used with human candidates who then make abstract decisions.
1.19.17.1.1. Con: Someone could lie and say they were for a particular option but then vote and negotiate the opposite way.
1.19.17.2. Con: The main discussion line here is electing people to single-winner office. The only thing the parent claim does is rule out Asset for referenda.
1.19.18. Pro: Asset is monotonic \(supporting your favorite doesn't hurt them.\)
1.19.19. Pro: Asset voting is party-agnostic.
1.19.20. Pro: An honest vote is always an optimal vote, so long as your favourite candidate shares your secondary preferences and is honest. Even if your favourite candidate is unable to win, they can be counted on to transfer their assets to a reasonable viable candidate.
1.19.20.1. Con: In a race with lots of candidates, it is vanishingly unlikely your favorite has the same preference order as you.
1.19.20.1.1. Con: Your favorite is more likely to share your preference order for the viable candidates.
1.19.20.1.2. Con: It is possible to vote for yourself or a proxy elector who pledges themselves to your favorite and not themselves 1st, but then shares your preference order.
1.19.21. Pro: Asset can easily support weighted voting i.e. some voters having more votes than others \(corporate governance, etc.\)
1.19.22. Pro: Candidates in Asset are less likely to be negative towards each other, since they might need each others' votes to win.
1.19.22.1. Con: This may undermine the ability of one candidate to hold another candidate to account.
1.20. Balanced Elimination Voting. A vote consists of an ordered collection of stanzas. Each stanza consists of a head and a tail. The head is a Boolean expression over the candidates. The tail is a Score ballot. The tally proceeds in rounds, eliminating candidates; the last candidate standing wins. A round chooses from each ballot the first stanza whose head is true for the candidates still in the running. It sums the tails of the chosen stanzas, and eliminates the candidate having the lowest total.
1.20.1. Con: BEV is extremely complicated to fill out a ballot and also to tally. It almost has to be done via computer.
1.20.1.1. Pro: A complicated ballot procedure would likely discourage voter participation.
1.20.2. Pro: Balanced Elimination Voting \(BEV\) can be treated as a framework under which simplified versions can be generated that might inherit many of BEV's advantages while losing or mitigating the disadvantages that result from excess complexity.
1.20.2.1. Pro: For example, there is the [system proposed on 2019-04-17](http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2019-April/002046.html) and explained better [at this link](https://forum.electionscience.org/t/where-the-people-are-without-strategy-there-is-tyranny/274/15?u=waugh).
1.20.2.1.1. Con: Kristofer Munsterhjelm [responded](http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2019-April/002047.html) to the proposal of 2019-04-17 with a withering criticism.
1.20.2.1.2. Pro: The system proposed on 2019-04-17 would handle more numerous fields of candidates well because it would only require a number of rounds approximating a logarithm of the count of candidates.
1.20.2.1.3. Pro: The system proposed on 2019-04-17 would not require voters to compose a Boolean expression, unlike fully elaborated Balanced Elimination Voting.
1.20.2.1.4. Pro: The system proposed on 2019-04-17 reduces the "tail" aspect of fully elaborated BEV to Approval style.
1.20.3. Con: The question of what strategies would be more powerful for voters of various opinions than naive strategies has not been well studied.
1.20.4. Con: Balanced Elimination Voting has not been subjected to simulation studies to see whether it behaves markedly better than Score Voting.
1.20.5. Pro: Provides ways for a voter to support a compromise candidate without diluting support for the voter's favorite candidates.
1.20.6. Pro: Conforms to Frohnmayer balance, i. e., every possible vote has an opposite that is also permitted in the system.
1.20.7. Con: Balanced Elimination Voting is not precinct summable.
1.20.8. Pro: Is extremely expressive.
1.20.9. Pro: Permits voters who like Approval, Score, IRV, Negative Vote, or FPtP to vote in the style of their favorite system.
1.20.9.1. Pro: If a Balanced Elimination Voting election is done digitally, there can be an option to auto-vote according to your favorite system. \(Example: Score and subsets = 1 stanza, head = ⊤, tail = the score/approval/FPTP ballot.\)
1.20.10. Con: Balanced Elimination Voting is not compatible with existing voting machines.
1.21. Score followed by Up-or-down. A Score election is held and the results announced. After a period for reflection, voters return to the polls to vote on whether the winner of the Score round should be placed in office. If this vote loses, the office is not filled and new candidates are sought.
1.21.1. Con: Having two elections is very costly, and there may even be four, six, or perhaps an unlimited number of elections.
1.21.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.21.1.2. Pro: Voters have to agree that the winner of the score round is placed in office. Thus, it is possible no consensus is ever reached.
1.21.2. Con: This cannot be used for critical offices that need to be filled at all times for the government to function.
1.21.2.1. Con: If a majority votes to suspend the government function, they will have made a judgment based on their assessment of the costs, risks, and drawbacks of such suspension as measured off against those of electing the candidate.
1.21.3. Pro: Satisfies those citizens who judge that it is better to suspend government function than to proceed without majority approval.
1.21.4. Pro: Mimics parliamentary procedure, which generally allows a decision only with majority approval.
1.21.5. Pro: If the time is getting ripe for a popular revolution \(radical change of form of government\), the outcomes of elections of this type can provide a clue of that ripeness for all observers to know and act on.
1.21.6. Con: Decreased turnout due to multiple rounds. Many people "ain't got time for that".
1.21.7. Pro: The first round is democratic, inheriting all the benefits of Score Voting.
1.21.8. Pro: No one would take office without majority agreement.
