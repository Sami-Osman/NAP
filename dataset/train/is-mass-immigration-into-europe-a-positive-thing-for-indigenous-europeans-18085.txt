Discussion Name: Is Mass Immigration into Europe a Positive Thing for Indigenous Europeans?

1. Mass immigration into Europe is a positive thing for indigenous Europeans.
1.1. Con: Immigration into Europe of peoples who are ethnically and culturally different to Europeans may create divisions in Europe.
1.1.1. Pro: Peoples with different values than indigenous Europeans will create tensions within a country's social structure.
1.1.2. Pro: Different ethnic groups may face racism and discrimination further creating conflict in a country.
1.1.3. Con: The Italian experience shows that it becomes a problem only when integration fails. Instead of keeping the discussion at the national level, one should take a look on small examples at local level, where the absence of sound policies \(and a fair political campaign\) has not stopped communities to find creative solutions. An example is [Riace](https://www.thelocal.it/20181019/italy-riace-model-migrant-town-struggles-to-survive), where the positive response of the community should considered as far more important than the unintellectual political discussion.
1.1.4. Con: Many different ethnicities and religions already live together in developed countries. Examples: Netherlands, France, Germany.
1.1.5. Con: Europe is a continent that already successfully accommodates [many different ethnicities and cultures](https://www.thenewfederalist.eu/identity-building-how-is-europe-different-from-the-nation?lang=fr); therefore, it seems that cultural differences do not create net divisions within Europe.
1.1.6. Pro: Diversity leads to a decrease in [trust and cohesion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvFN8ACY6taivkcbzDGgYy1-EPb1kbbQ/view) within a community:
1.2. Pro: Societies can cope and thrive with high immigration.
1.2.1. Con: The 2-tier system of residency--citizenship and labor visa--as practiced in the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia is probably not acceptable in democratic politics. The monarchic value structure allows for inner and outer circle without the democratic guilt of inequility haunting their policies. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirati_nationality_law)
1.2.2. Con: The UAE have rather a modern slave policy for low-skilled workers aswell as a pro-expatriate policy for high-skilled workers where the law is very strict regarding their rights and their time on UAE soil is temporary.[Labor Migration in the United Arab Emirates: Challenges and Responses](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/labor-migration-united-arab-emirates-challenges-and-responses/)
1.2.3. Pro: [The UAE](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/united-arab-emirates-population/) has a high percentage of immigrants and is a developed country.
1.3. Pro: Immigration serves as a remedy to problems created by population aging.
1.3.1. Con: The problems of aging, pension funding and dependency ratios can be addressed with purely economic solutions such as retirement age, structure of the funds, mandatory years of work, etc.
1.3.2. Con: Advances in automation and technology makes the need for a workforce smaller.
1.3.3. Con: The solution to demographic changes should not be to import the next generations from other countries.
1.3.3.1. Pro: [Natalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalism) or [Nativist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativism_\(politics\)) policies are preferrable to immigration for the purpose of curbing population decline.
1.3.3.2. Con: The issue of [low European fertility rates](https://www.ft.com/content/d54e4fe8-3269-11e8-b5bf-23cb17fd1498) is compelling and immigration answers precisely this problematic trend.
1.3.4. Pro: [The United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/populationfacts/docs/MigrationPopFacts20178.pdf) predicts migration will "reduce old-age dependency ratios in the developed regions"
1.4. Pro: Immigrants will bring an array of culture not experienced by Europeans.
1.4.1. Con: Europeans travel a great deal nowadays and have experienced a many of those cultures. Even without travel, most of those cultures are already present in the EU and native Europeans have experienced them first hand.
1.4.2. Pro: Immigrants will bring a diversity of food to Europe.
1.4.2.1. Con: To bring a further diversity of food to Europe you do not need a mass migration, reasonable level of migration would do.
1.4.2.2. Con: Europe already has a plethora of ethnic food, such as in Halal butcheries or African stores.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Neither Halal butcheries nor African stores would exist if there weren't a substantial population of immigrants to sustain them.
1.4.3. Con: This is wholly subjective. Diversity is diversity, some types are not better than others.
1.4.3.1. Con: [Monogamy is crucial for a peaceful society.](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/polygamy-fuels-violence/) In countries which have a higher percentage of population in polygamous marriage keep erupting with local unrest \([See analysis](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2017/12/19/the-link-between-polygamy-and-war)\). And this effect was seen in Europe \([Paris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1503245/Migrant-polygamy-helped-cause-riots.html)\) as well. Polygamy also leads to child marriage, as the need for brides has to be satisfied. Having a polygamous society within your state is therefore not beneficial.
1.4.3.2. Con: Different cultures have different values, and some are not compatible with European values. In rural India for example, [cows are worth more than women](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40404102). If we would just import all Indians without selection, and without demanding integration from them, we would have the same here.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Not all Indians believe in this; it is an outdated view, much like Christianity used to believe that women were owned by their parents and had zero rights. It is not fair to judge an entire nation on the lowest common denominator.
1.4.3.3. Con: The success of [faith schools](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/08/29/faith-schools-are-beacons-of-intellectual-rigour/) shows that diversity isn't always beneficial. Uniformity takes many obstacles out of the way, and therefore enables better results.
1.4.4. Pro: British diversity includes the cultural diversity of Commonwealth countries. European diversity comes from everywhere, it is already part of us.
1.4.4.1. Con: Even if European diversity is already part of Europe, most Europeans are not convinced that [more diversity would be beneficial](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2016/07/11/europeans-not-convinced-growing-diversity-is-a-good-thing-divided-on-what-determines-national-identity/).
1.5. Con: Countries can't deplete all of their financial, social or physical resources to helping others.
1.5.1. Pro: Currently, there is no upper limit to how much immigration there is to countries \(except from extremes\), which is not plausible in the long term.
1.5.2. Con: Countries don't deplete their financial or social resources helping immigrants, as many "young, economically active and high-skilled migrants are [net contributors to the economy](http://ec.europa.eu/research/social-sciences/pdf/policy_reviews/ki-04-15-841_en_n.pdf)". \(p.125\)
1.5.3. Pro: Governmental financial costs associated with immigration are high, as the estimated cost for processing and accommodating asylum seekers is [â‚¬10,000 per application](https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/migration-policy-debates-13.pdf). \(p.1\)
1.6. Pro: Immigration is economically beneficial for Europe.
1.6.1. Pro: High skill immigrants will fill voids that cannot be filled by indigenous Europeans.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The competition in the job market may also help provoke indigenous Europeans to seek higher education and become more skilled themselves.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Low skill immigrants will fill gaps in jobs that indigenous Europeans do not want to do.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: High and low skilled workers take away opportunities available to indigenous Europeans.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: There is a [lack of apprenticeships](https://nrl.co.uk/knowledge-hub/lack-of-apprenticeships-highlighted-as-one-of-the-issues-behind-britains-worst-skills-shortage-for-30-years/) in the UK.
1.6.1.2.1.2. Con: Employers often prefer employees who speak European languages well, meaning that immigrants often have to overcome language prejudice to get a job.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: This could inspire complacency from indigenous Europeans.
1.6.1.3. Con: High skill immigrants can labour migrate.
1.6.1.4. Con: Mass immigration increases the competition for jobs and lowers wages. This serves big companies but not the employed poor and middle class people.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: Majority of immigrants are low skilled, in the UK only [last year scrapping the cap for high skilled migrants was discussed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45556246) \(20,700 per year\) despite immigration from outside the EU being on level around [300,000 per year](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/#create-graph) for a long time.
1.6.1.5. Pro: The population growth in Europe is negative in many countries. This means that the economically active portion of their populations are shrinking. Currently, immigrants in Europe [support their economies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017736094) with labour that would not be available if immigrants were not there.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: If all immigrants of the past 30 years should magically disappear it would have [serious consequences](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017736094) for the industries and economies of the EU countries.
1.6.2. Con: Overall poverty of the world is declining rapidly and UNs goal is to annihilate extreme poverty [by 2030](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).
1.6.3. Pro: The economy is a [pyramid scheme](https://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/world-economy-has-been-like-a-pyramid-scheme/) and subsequently populations must continue to grow to sustain the hierarchy. The only way to do that is through mass immigration.
1.6.3.1. Con: The increase of population increases rent cost and lowers wages by the increased competition. Especially in low skill labour.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.6.1.4.
1.6.5. Con: It is not a positive thing for indigenous Europeans when wealth is redistributed to immigrants
1.6.5.1. Con: In a capitalist system that supposedly works, high-earning individuals only benefit the economy as their spending leads to the circulation of money.
1.6.6. Con: Europe's economic system is not suited towards integrating the migrants productively into the economy. When we look at European economies we already see [high youth unemployment](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/).
1.6.6.1. Pro: This is because a great deal of the jobs in Europe have become wrapped up in either government or high end industries both have a high barrier of entry. The addition of low skilled migrants only compounds the difficulties faced by European nations.
1.7. Con: Immigration from third world countries tends to create a burden on the welfare state that has been established in European countries.
1.7.1. Pro: [99% of immigrants in Germany in 2016 were unemployed](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/710927/million-migrants-Germany-unemployed-Merkel-open-door-policy), [only 0.3% in Sweden had found jobs in 2017](https://www.dailywire.com/news/18546/03-refugees-who-flooded-sweden-now-have-jobs-joseph-curl). That is a lot of people who then needs to live on welfare to survive in just those two countries.
1.7.1.1. Con: Assuming this is true, there is no reason the government couldn't create rules that could stop unemployment. Thatâ€™s the governmentâ€™s mistake, not the immigrantsâ€™. Some of them search for jobs but just canâ€™t get any.
1.7.1.2. Con: These sources are tabloids, one of which quoting Breitbart without precise sources. [More reliable sources](https://www.ft.com/content/bea8507e-64cb-11e8-90c2-9563a0613e56) quote 40% unemployment among refugees in Germany this year, versus 50% last year, showing that there is progress - although it is indeed still very high. Reasons are mostly due to lack of knowledge of the language, which shows that further integration would help.
1.7.2. Pro: Currently the reason for mass immigration are humanitarian. A [study in Sweden](https://eso.expertgrupp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Summary.pdf) suggests that immigrants cost [8404 USD annually](https://eso.expertgrupp.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ESO-2018_3-Tid-for-integration.pdf).
1.7.2.1. Con: This study is however very conservative since it does not consider the cost of Swedenâ€™s agencies that support migrants and/or handles migrants such as Swedenâ€™s migration agency which 2016 cost 6.696205 billion U.S. dollars. It also does not consider the rise of inmates in prisons etc.
1.8. Con: Crime rates increase in European countries as more immigration comes in.
1.8.1. Pro: Mass immigration from outside the Europe does not allow for proper vetting of migrants. This means some of them will be dangerous for local society: [criminals](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/644827/refugees-committed-crimes-Germany-migrant-crisis-last-year),[terrorists](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/Islamic-State-ISIS-Smuggler-THOUSANDS-Extremists-into-Europe-Refugees), [mentally ill](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-murky-role-of-mental-illness-in-extremism-terror/) or even [carrying diseases](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/39/6/833/358587) long time forgotten or new for local population.
1.8.2. Pro: Not all cultures are equal and mass immigration from other cultures brings problems into European society - new or ones that were long time sorted out and kept in bay. [FMG](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/female-genital-mutilation-fgm/who-is-affected/), [honour killings](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4091357/what-is-honour-killing-murder-uk/), [rapes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/quilliam-grooming-gangs-report-asian-abuse-rotherham-rochdale-newcastle-a8101941.html) or[intolerance towards other communities](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/homosexuality-tolerance-acceptance-uk-research-ethnic-minorities-lifestyles-a8355016.html) \(Jew, LGBT etc.\).
1.8.3. Con: In [Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-crime-rate-drops-but-fear-rises/a-43692277), crime rates dropped after the influx of immigrants.
1.8.3.1. Con: The general crime rate among all people in germany drops, the criminal rate among immigrants is rising .[bka.de](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/PKS2018/Standardtabellen/standardtabellenTatverdaechtige.html?nn=108686) Violent crime has risen by 1.4% from 2017 to 2018.
1.8.4. Pro: In [Sweden](https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/swedish-crime-survey.html), crime rates have been rising significantly each year since the migrant influx of 2015/2016.
1.8.4.1. Con: These numbers do not specify the origin of the criminals. There is no causality. According to the [Swedish government](https://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/), "studies show that the majority of those suspected of crimes were born in Sweden to two Swedish-born parents. The studies also show that the vast majority of people from foreign backgrounds are not suspected of any crimes."
1.8.4.2. Con: These numbers are only up until 2016. That is not sufficient. It looks more like an increase since 2010 with maybe an acceleration since 2015, but you need numbers for 2017 and 2018 to conclude that.
1.8.5. Pro: There are known cases of [no-go zones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-go_area) in European countries with high levels of immigration. Especially in the UK and Sweden.
1.8.5.1. Con: The claims about the supposed 'no-go zones' have been publicly debunked as inaccurate reporting and the source, Gatestone Institute has been criticized for alleged [anti-Muslim bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatestone_Institute#Allegations_of_anti-Muslim_bias).
1.9. Pro: Immigration is not a novel concept; the world is tending towards unification, which benefits all, and so mass immigration ultimately suits that purpose.
1.9.1. Pro: The planet is rich for all its inhabitants; only the notion of justice is missing to distribute these riches fairly, this is our challenge today.
1.9.2. Con: History would suggest that these migrations had a huge negative impact on the indigenous population: natives of Americas or Australia.
1.9.3. Con: Unification means less or even lack of the diversity. This is surely not a good result.
1.9.4. Con: This contains a fallacy. It appeals to tradition; because something was done a certain way before doesn't mean it should continue.
1.9.5. Con: The trends of the world are not necessarily what is best for the indigenous peoples of Europe.
1.9.6. Pro: In an ideal humanistic society opportunity should be equal for everyone. Allowing people to immigrate to Europe creates more equal opportunity.
