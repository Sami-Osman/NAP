Discussion Name: Ukraine should become a member of EU

1. Ukraine should become a member of EU.
1.1. Con: It would be economically damaging to Ukraine to join the EU.
1.1.1. Con: Joining the EU could boost Ukraine's economy as it would benefit from [the free movement of people allowed in the EU, together with the legal EU system that includes products, services, and capital within the internal market](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/explained-what-would-ukraines-membership-to-european-union-mean-for-both-articleshow.html).
1.1.2. Pro: Ukraine would most likely pull money away from existing members since [it is far less wealthy than them](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-is-ukraine-still-so-poor/) and, thus, eligible for more subsidies.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Comparatively poor EU members like Hungary and Poland are [net beneficiaries](https://www.statista.com/chart/18794/net-contributors-to-eu-budget/); this inevitably comes at the cost of other countries. The same would be the case for Ukraine.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: By this logic, countries like [Bulgaria and Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_enlargement_of_the_European_Union) should not have been admitted to join the EU in 2007. Yet this argument is generally not used against the ascension of new member countries.
1.1.3. Pro: With EU membership, many Ukrainians may seek better employment opportunities in more developed member states, causing a brain drain.
1.1.3.1. Pro: An [exodus of human capital](https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/recent-eu-enlargement-led-to-brain-drain-in-new-members/)(Instead of increasing cross-border cooperation, the enlargement of the European Union has resulted in an exodus of human capital from the eastern member states to the west of the continent, according to a new study.) from new member states has been observed for many years. There is no reason to believe Ukraine would be any different.
1.1.4. Con: Other countries, such as [Poland, did benefit economically from joining the EU](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/01/eu-poland-10-years-economic).
1.2. Pro: A majority of Ukrainian citizens want to join the EU.
1.2.1. Pro: According to a [poll](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/255939.html) conducted in February 2015 in all regions of Ukraine except Crimea, 66.4% would have voted in favor of joining the EU and 33.6% against with a turnout of 76.4%.
1.2.2. Con: [The May 2014 ComRes poll](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/12/world/europe/ukraine-cnn-poll/index.html) found out that in the 3 most eastern [Oblasts of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblasts_of_Ukraine) \(provinces\), [Kharkiv Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast), [Donetsk Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast) and [Luhansk Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_Oblast), 37% favored an alliance with [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia).
1.2.2.1. Con: Even if provinces where ethnic Rusisian population represents a majority are against getting closer to Europe, [a majority of Ukrainian citizens are in favor of closer EU ties](https://intellinews.com/fpri-bmb-ukraine-majority-of-ukrainians-want-to-join-the-eu-206596/?source=ukraine).
1.2.3. Pro: [Ukrainian citizens want to join the EU](https://www.intellinews.com/fpri-bmb-ukraine-majority-of-ukrainians-want-to-join-the-eu-206596/) because Ukraine would benefit from being part of it.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Joining the EU could immediately help Ukraine militarily.
1.2.4. Con: The most important reason Ukrainians want to join the EU is the higher [social security](https://razumkov.org.ua/en/articles/ukraine-on-the-path-to-the-eu-citizens-opinions-and-hopes)(The most important achievement of the EU mentioned by Ukrainians is the high level of social security \(46.4%\).), but this can be achieved without EU membership.
1.2.4.1. Con: The [list of countries](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/social-spending-highest-lowest-country-comparison-oecd-france-economics-politics-welfare/) spending the most on social security is dominated by EU members, suggesting a close association between the two.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Health and social security responsibilities lie primarily with [individual EU member states](https://www.what-europe-does-for-me.eu/data/pdf/focus/focus09_en.pdf)(While responsibility for health and social security lies primarily with the governments of the individual European Union \(EU\) Member States, the EU complements national policies, especially those with a cross-border dimension. \(p. 1\)), meaning Ukraine would still be responsible for its own social security policy-making.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: EU law is trending towards [enhanced social security coordination](https://pr.euractiv.com/pr/european-parliament-and-eu-governments-close-long-awaited-deal-social-security-coordination)(\[In December 2021\], the European Parliament and EU governments agreed to update the rules for social security coordination, including unemployment benefits, long-term care and family benefits, as well as better rules for posting workers and applicable legislation. Once approved, these new rules will help millions of mobile European workers by guaranteeing more social security for workers moving from one EU country to another. Around 14 million EU residents live or work in another member state. The social security systems that apply to them are determined by the relevant individual EU countries.), which Ukraine may eventually benefit from.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: At present, increased coordination of social security relates to EU citizens working in [another EU country](https://pr.euractiv.com/pr/european-parliament-and-eu-governments-close-long-awaited-deal-social-security-coordination) and not to citizens based in their own country.
1.3. Pro: Ukraine has long been seen as an important partner for the EU.
1.3.1. Con: The status as a partner should not determine membership. Else, the United States and Japan would also be applicable.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Israel is also an important EU partner\(it even is part of [Eurovision](https://eurovision.tv/country/israel)(srael made its debut in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973 as the first non-European country granted permission to participate in the event. The EBU allowed Israel to participate since the country's broadcaster was already one of its members.)\), but that does not mean it should be accepted into the EU, especially due to it’s [ongoing occupation of the Golan Heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/27/syria-condemns-israel-plan-double-golan-heights-settlements).
1.3.2. Con: [Ukraine](https://theconversation.com/a-short-history-of-ukraines-relationship-with-the-european-union-178350)(For a long time, for many Europeans, Ukraine has been a country without much agency. It was deemed to lie outside Europe. And it was often seen as a mere geopolitical bridge between the EU and Russia.\n\nThis debate about Ukraine’s place in the European international order after the end of the cold war was connected with Ukrainian domestic politics. There were questions of corruption and of mass poverty. Some regions in Ukraine were steaming ahead, beginning to produce hi-tech computer games and apps, while others were left behind, relying on the decaying infrastructure of the old heavy industries.) was considered as a "mere geopolitical bridge between the EU and Russia."
1.3.2.1. Pro: Ukraine could be seen as a "[buffer state](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341827784_Small_States_in_Europe_as_a_Buffer_between_East_and_West)(uffer states appeared in the 19th century, created by European great powers in order to \nmanage competition between them in Europe, Asia and Africa, as colonial powers; they thus \nhelped to avoid direct confrontation and led to prolonged periods of peace among rival \npowers. Afghanistan, Belgium, Siam and Switzerland constitute examples of buffer states)" between Russia and Europe that has found itself as the "weaker state" caught in East-West rivalry.
1.3.3. Pro: Ukraine has been significant for the entire EU in terms of [political stability, security, and energy-related matters](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2013/04/16/why-does-ukraine-matter-to-eu-pub-51522).
1.3.3.1. Con: EU has stated that Ukraine won't be able to [fast track its membership into the EU](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/11/eu-dashes-ukraines-hopes-of-quick-membership), which shows that Ukraine is not that significant for the entire EU in terms of stability and security.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: The presidents of eight eastern European countries - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia - [signed a letter on February 28 saying Ukraine "deserves receiving an immediate EU accession perspective."](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/presidents-8-eu-states-call-immediate-talks-ukrainian-membership-2022-02-28/)
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also stated that Ukraine was [“one of us and we want them in the EU](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-bid-fast-track-membership-eu-likely-end-disappointment-zelenskiy)”.
1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The European Commission's support to Ukraine is only symbolic because the process to join the EU is complex and it would also require the [unanimous agreement of all 27 member states](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220303-facing-an-existential-threat-ukraine-seeks-immediate-eu-membership-%E2%80%93-but-can-the-bloc-deliver).
1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: This is an appeal to authority and appeal to popularity, making such an argument fallacious.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Even though Ukraine signed [an association agreement, considered as a precursor to EU accession, in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union%E2%80%93Ukraine_Association_Agreement), because EU membership has to meet a set of conditions, [know as the "Copenhagen criteria"](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/11/1086007627/european-union-ukraine-membership-fast-track)(A country wishing to join the EU must meet a set of conditions that are known as the "Copenhagen criteria" and include things like respect for democracy and rule of law. Then it can submit an application to the European Council, which in turn asks the European Commission to weigh in on whether it meets those criteria.).
1.3.3.2. Pro: Ukraine plays an [important role in European energy security](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/why-ukraine-is-central-to-europe-s-energy-security/).
1.3.3.3. Pro: When Ukraine cut off gas supplies to Europe in 2009, after Russia did the same to them, it already showed how [Ukraine's security is important for Europe's stability](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20699566).
1.3.4. Pro: Ukraine's desire to join the [European Union dates back to 1993](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karina-Shyrokykh/publication/325937606_The_Evolution_of_the_Foreign_Policy_of_Ukraine_External_Actors_and_Domestic_Factors/links/5b83bc2d4585151fd1350b6c/The-Evolution-of-the-Foreign-Policy-of-Ukraine-External-Actors-and-Domestic-Factors.pdf?origin=publication_detail)(Ukraine’s ‘European choice’ has been a major priority for its foreign policy since the Verkhovna Rada\nresolution ‘On the main directions of the foreign policy of Ukraine’, which stated ‘the foreign policy efforts of\nUkraine should be all the time directed at the development of European regional cooperation in all affairs with a purpose of strengthening of its national independence and the effective provision of international interests’\n\(Verkhovna Rada Ukrayiny 1993, art. III\). p7).
1.3.4.1. Con: The same can be said about Turkey which has been in talks [for decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union#1950s%E2%80%931990s). Yet this is generally seen not as a reason in itself for Turkey to become a member.
1.4. Con: It would be politically damaging to the EU if Ukraine gained membership because Ukraine is not politically aligned with EU values.
1.4.1. Pro: Ukraine is a young, relatively [unstable democracy](https://freedomhouse.org/country/ukraine/nations-transit/2021), while the EU is founded on strong [democratic ideals](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en).
1.4.2. Pro: To accept member states into the EU who do not align with EU values degrades the importance of those values.
1.4.3. Con: Ukraine could gain membership on the basis that it undergoes political reform.
1.4.4. Con: Existing members of the EU have adopted policies and laws that do not always align with EU values either. To reject Ukraine on this basis would therefore be applying a double-standard.
1.4.4.1. Con: The EU is trying to [actively fight the rise of right-wing extremism among its existing members](https://europeangreens.eu/content/combating-right-wing-extremism-throughout-europe).
1.4.4.2. Pro: In 2019, [Poland's government](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-risks-eu-membership-with-legal-reforms-court-warns/)(Last week, three PiS MPs filed a bill that would penalize judges who question the legitimacy of legal changes made by the government, saying it is forbidden to “show hostility toward other authorities of the Republic of Poland and its constitutional organs, as well as to criticize the basic principles of the Republic of Poland.”) sought to undermine the independence of its judiciary, which goes against the EU's ideals on the [rule of law](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en)(Rule of law\nThe EU is based on the rule of law. Everything the EU does is founded on treaties, voluntarily and democratically agreed by its EU countries. Law and justice are upheld by an independent judiciary. The EU countries gave final jurisdiction to the European Court of Justice - its judgments have to be respected by all.).
1.4.5. Con: The EU gains more influence the more countries are part of it.
1.4.6. Pro: Ukraine joining the European Union would make Putin even angrier, and more aggressive.
1.4.6.1. Pro: According to a [Russian diplomat at the UN](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/13/ukraines-eu-entry-on-par-with-joining-nato-russia-says-a77661), Russia sees Ukrainian membership of the European Union to be equivalent to Ukraine joining NATO, therefore Putin could retaliate even more.
1.4.6.2. Con: According to the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, Putin might have stated that [Ukraine could join the EU as long as it doesn't join NATO](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/03/28/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-russia-willing-to-let-ukraine-join-eu-if-it-stays-out-of-nato-report-says/).
