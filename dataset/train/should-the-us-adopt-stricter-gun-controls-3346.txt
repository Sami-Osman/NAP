Discussion Name: Should the US adopt stricter gun controls?

1. The US should adopt stricter gun control legislation, in the form of the policy defined in the [background discussion info](https://www.kialo.com/should-the-us-adopt-stricter-gun-controls-3346/settings?back=%2Fshould-the-us-adopt-stricter-gun-controls-3346%3Fpath%3D3346.0~3346.1).
1.1. Pro: Stricter gun control legislation may [reduce](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/three-types-laws-could-reduce-gun-deaths-more-10)(On average, establishing right-to-carry and stand your ground laws resulted in a slight uptick in annual gun deaths—about 3% for each law, the team reports today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Conversely, creating laws aimed at making it harder to for children to get their hands on guns—say, by requiring parents to keep guns in safes—reduced gun deaths by an average of 6%. States that enacted strict child access laws, make it illegal to carry a gun in public without a permit, and don’t have a stand your ground law could expect to see an 11% reduction in annual gun deaths, according to the new model.\n\nEight states presently have that constellation of laws—California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island—and six of those states are in the bottom 10 for per capita gun deaths, according to CDC’s state-by-state firearm mortality data.) instances of gun-related injury, accidental death, murder, and suicide.
1.1.1. Pro: Stricter regulation would make people consider their decision to own a gun more seriously.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Enacting waiting periods creates a cooling off period among buyers and significantly reduce the incidence of gun violence \([p. 12162](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5699026/pdf/pnas.201619896.pdf)\).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Delaying the purchase of guns by a couple of days \([p. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/46/12162.full.pdf)\) could save nearly [1,700 lives](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/16/health/waiting-period-firearms-study/index.html) a year in the US.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Requiring people to apply for license would prevent people from [impulsively](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488038/guns-firearms-waiting-periods-brady-act-deaths-homicides-suicides-study) buying a gun in a fit of anger. This could reduce incidences of [crimes of passion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_passion).
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Gun purchase waiting times have been linked with [reduced suicide](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/24/doug-jones/yes-waiting-periods-gun-purchases-have-been-linked/), but evidence for the effect of waiting periods on violent crime and intimate partner homicide [is inconclusive](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/waiting-periods/violent-crime.html).
1.1.1.2. Pro: Possession of a firearm makes a person significantly more likely to impulsively attempt to [complete suicide](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-guns-in-home-increase-suicide-homicide-risk/).
1.1.1.2.1. Con: There doesn't seem to be [a connection](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-brain/201607/fact-check-gun-control-and-suicide) between suicide and gun ownership rates.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Gun ownership increases chances of [accidental and suicidal deaths](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1559827610396294) of family members more than it protects them from external dangers.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Scientific evidence indicates that the presence of a gun in a household greatly increases the chances of both homicide and suicide \([p. 935](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-pdf/160/10/929/327746/kwh309.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Suicide by gun has a [90% fatality rate](https://www.mentalhelp.net/blogs/guns-and-suicide/), while the success rate for suicides by other methods is below [10%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgD9AlxZxNE).
1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Passing a background check on mental health grounds [does not guarantee](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/background-checks/suicide.html) that an individual would not use their gun to harm themselves or others.
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Passing a mental health [evaluation](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-making-diagnosis#1) indicates a reduced likelihood of harming oneself or others.
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Laws which limit firearm access of individuals from [high-risk groups](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evidence-based-living/201710/the-evidence-reducing-gun-violence) reduce violence.
1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: While gun-related suicides are tragic, mental health concerns are best addressed with increased funding and public access to mental health services rather than by legislative action.
1.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Firearm suicide is a particularly [instantaneous](http://www.hhpronline.org/articles/2017/10/21/can-public-policy-reduce-firearm-related-death-in-the-united-states) form of suicide, giving those with access to it very little time to reconsider or seek medical help.
1.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: It would be more difficult for some at risk populations - for example, [teenagers](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/teen-suicide-guns-in-america-mass-shootings-data/581335/) suffering from clinical depression - to acquire the deadly means to complete suicide if firearms were properly restricted.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: A desperately suicidal person could simply find other means.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.3.
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: More than [half](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/do-states-with-easier-access-to-guns-have-more-suicide-deaths-by-firearm/)(Suicides account for over half of all firearm deaths \(54%\), and over half of all suicides involve a firearm \(53%\). Though mass shootings are more widely covered, data reveal that suicides are a more common cause of firearm-related deaths than homicide. In 2020, a little more than half \(54%\) of all firearm-related deaths were suicides, 43% were homicides, and 2% were accidental discharges or undetermined causes. This represents a slight decrease from 2018 and 2019, where suicides by firearms accounted for over 60% of all firearm deaths in that period. Looking at suicides, we find that guns were involved in 53% of suicides in 2020, representing the majority of all suicides.) of all suicides in the US are carried out with a firearm.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: In a country of over [300 million](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2017/estimates-demographics.html) people, around 40,000 gun deaths \(2017\), of which almost 2/3 are suicide, does not justify the proposed legislation \([p. 33, 35](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf)\).
1.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: The significance of 40,000 gun deaths in the US is amplified by the fact that around the same number of people die in firearm related incidents [every year](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/facts/gun-violence-statistics/).
1.1.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: With suicide being 2/3rd of gun-related deaths, the effort spent to enact new gun-control laws would be much better spent lobbying for comprehensive and universal access to healthcare and mental health services.
1.1.1.2.4.1.3. Con: The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) lists suicide as the #10 cause of death in the US.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: There is [clear sociological evidence](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-ownership-and-use/) that the ease of killing oneself is enough to persuade one to turn depression into suicide. This is also reflected in the numbers.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Improved gun control legislation could improve gun education, storage, and maintenance to avoid accidental gun-related deaths.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Safe storage laws are [unconstitutional](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-09-11/san-diegos-law-requiring-guns-be-locked-at-home-to-take-effect-this-week) and unenforceable without random home searches by police \([p. 98](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kvRzgm_RmcgC&pg=RA3-PA98&lpg=RA3-PA98&dq=gun+cabinet+laws+are+%22unenforceable%22&source=bl&ots=5rxQrJZtN1&sig=ACfU3U1e0_9H7B6QE7QZT8mwaQPIZ09B6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiStOmEv53pAhUYHcAKHQ1pADMQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=gun%20cabinet%20laws%20are%20%22unenforceable%22&f=false)\).
1.1.1.3.2. Con: In states where mandatory training courses are required before a gun license is issued, the courses often [overlook](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gun-safety-training/gun-training-covers-many-safety-issues-but-not-some-major-ones-idUSKBN1CT28N) major safety components.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Gun control laws in California have [demonstrated](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/state-law/california/) strong correlations in preventing accidental gun deaths due to law-abiding gun owners acting in safer ways with firearms.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The annual number of gun-related accidental deaths has [declined](https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/gun-safety/#_edn3) by more than 66% in the last 25 years, irrespective of changes to legislation.
1.1.1.3.4. Pro: [Educating](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/gun-education-not-gun-control) the public on the facts of legal, responsible gun handling and ownership is paramount to firearm safety in a gun-legal society.
1.1.1.3.5. Pro: The requirement to pass a state administered test would [raise the competency](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2018/survey-more-than-half-of-u-s-gun-owners-do-not-safely-store-their-guns.html) level of all gun owners in the storage, maintenance, and operation of their firearms, thereby reducing the number of accidental shootings.
1.1.1.4. Con: Many gun owners take gun ownership seriously enough to voluntarily take a [pledge](https://projectchildsafe.org/) to educate their children about guns and properly store and secure their weapons.
1.1.1.5. Con: Gun sales [spike](https://www.futurity.org/gun-sales-gun-control-coverage-2089772/) whenever gun control is suggested by political leaders.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: Historically, gun control legislation has not always predicted drastic increases gun and ammunition sales.
1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: While the Brady Bill and the Federal Assault Weapons ban were enacted during the [Clinton administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_policy_of_the_Bill_Clinton_administration), gun and ammunition sales were significantly higher during the [Obama administration](https://www.newsweek.com/gun-sales-down-after-obama-boom-years-573170).
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Former president Obama was awarded the informal '[gun salesman of the year](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-04-29/barack-obama-gun-salesman-of-the-year)' when his advocacy of gun control reform led to the [largest increase](http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales/index.html) in gun sales in the US.
1.1.2. Pro: Empirical evidence indicates that there is a strong and significant link between weak gun laws and high rates of gun violence.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Across high-income nations like the US, areas with more firearms [tend to have](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/) a greater number of homicides.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: When looking specifically at [the US](http://archive.sph.harvard.edu/press-releases/2007-releases/press01112007.html), states with higher rates of gun ownership have higher rates of both firearm homicide and homicide in general, once other factors \(wealth, urbanisation, etc\) are controlled for.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Connecticut added very strict gun laws. Since then, gun-related homicides have been [almost halved](https://www.wnpr.org/post/whats-been-impact-connecticuts-gun-laws-after-sandy-hook).
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Looking at statewide rather than [citywide](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2012/12/geography-us-gun-violence/4171/) statistics misrepresents the data by failing to acknowledge the correlation between large cities and homicides irrespective of gun ownership in the state.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: The number of guns in circulation has increased steadily in the US for decades during which violent crime rates, including gun crime, has steadily [decreased](http://www.aei.org/publication/chart-of-the-day-more-guns-less-gun-violence-between-1993-and-2013/).
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: There is no reason to suggest that guns [deserve credit](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/14/17991768/crime-drop-murder-guns-violence) for the crime decline.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: This has more to do with the overall [general decrease](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/) in violent crime in the US.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: The evidence for the correlation between violent crime and firearm ownership is [mixed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091930).
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Access to a gun strongly [increases](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gun-suicide/gun-access-tied-to-greater-suicide-murder-risk-study-idUSBREA0J1G920140120) the likelihood of committing murder.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The [Reuters source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gun-suicide/gun-access-tied-to-greater-suicide-murder-risk-study-idUSBREA0J1G920140120) is problematic because it uses studies published from 1988 - 2005. Since then, homicide rates have declined significantly, while the number of guns has [increased](https://mises.org/wire/fbi-us-homicide-rate-51-year-low).
1.1.2.2. Pro: Cross-analyzing data on firearm deaths per state with number of firearm regulations per state shows that increasing regulations does [decrease](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/states-with-strict-gun-laws-have-fewer-firearms-deaths-heres-how-your-state-stacks-up.html) firearm deaths.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: States with the [strictest](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/us/everytown-weak-gun-laws-high-gun-deaths-study/index.html)(A study published in January by a leading non-profit organization that focuses on gun violence prevention found that there is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings.\n\nThe study by Everytown for Gun Safety determined that California had the strongest gun laws in the country. Hawaii topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country while Mississippi led the country with both the weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.) gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun deaths, while those with the most lax laws have the highest.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: [Chicago](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/555580598/fact-check-is-chicago-proof-that-gun-laws-don-t-work) has some of the strictest gun laws in America, and yet also has some of the highest rates of gun crime.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: [Smugglers in Illinois](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/12/us/gun-traffickers-smuggling-state-gun-laws.html) are able to easily drive to neighbouring Indiana, make large firearm purchases and return.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Detroit has some of the strictest [gun laws](https://www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/michigan-gun-laws/) in America yet also the highest [murder rate](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/detroit/crime).
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Hawai'i has the [lowest gun death rate](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/facts/gun-violence-statistics/) in the US and some of the strongest gun laws in the country. Only two people are killed with guns for every 100,000 residents.
1.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Alaska has the [highest gun death rate](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/facts/gun-violence-statistics/) among all the states in the US, as well as some of the weakest [gun laws](https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/resources/ccw_reciprocity_map/ak-gun-laws/), nearly 25 people are killed with guns for every 100,000 residents.
1.1.2.2.1.5. Con: In spite of strict gun control legislation, [California](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/cacrime.htm)'s murder rate has increased since 1960.
1.1.2.2.1.6. Pro: States with [lenient](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/right-to-carry-gun-violence/531297/) "right-to-carry" gun laws tend to have higher rates of violent crime.
1.1.2.2.1.6.1. Pro: The level of violence across the 10 states in the US with the weakest gun laws is [3.2 times higher](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2016/10/11/145830/america-under-fire/) than in the 10 states with the strongest laws.
1.1.2.2.1.7. Pro: The tightening of gun sales regulations in Connecticut in 1995 led to a reduction in gun homicides of 40% and in gun suicides by [15%](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/gun-licensing-law).
1.1.2.2.1.7.1. Con: [Since 1995](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm), the murder rate across the entire US dropped by nearly 40%. Connecticut's drop in gun murder rate is not statistically significant.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: In 2007, Missouri repealed its handgun permit law, and immediately saw an increase in firearm murders, but not other types of murders. \([p. 2](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-gun-policy-and-research/_archive-2019/_pdfs/effects-of-missouris-repeal-of-its-handgun-purchaser-licensing-law-on-homicides.pdf)\)
1.1.2.2.3. Con: Many of the states with the highest murder rates have reduced their murder rates since 1960 without instituting gun regulations.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: The states that have [adopted](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303701) strict gun control legislation have seen the greatest reduction in gun violence and gun-related crime.
1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: [South Carolina](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/sccrime.htm), which had the highest murder rate in the US in 1960, has more than halved its murder rate without gun control legislation.
1.1.2.3. Con: Gun control does not prevent gun violence.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The presence of a firearm is strongly associated with increased feelings of aggression, and leads to more violent, controlling, and [aggressive](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/201301/the-weapons-effect) behaviour. \([p. 359](https://ajbenjaminjr.tripod.com/articles/bkb18.pdf)(The results of the basic or naïve meta-analysis show that merely seeing a weapon can increase aggressive thoughts, hostile appraisals, and aggressive behavior. Our findings extend previous reviews of the weapons effect literature \(e.g., Carlson et al., 1990\). In particular, the obtained results not only provide additional evidence that the mere presence of weapons can potentially increase aggressive behavior, but more importantly, provide insights into why such an increase might occur.)\).
1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: An increase in aggression [is shown to have a correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_correlations_of_criminal_behaviour#Psychological_traits) with an increase in crime.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Evidence suggests that the link between the presence of a firearm and aggression, known as the weapons effect, is weak or nonexistent \([pp. 59-60](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi6sP3p1c3qAhWoTt8KHc1NCGYQFjABegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fcontent%2Fpdf%2F10.3758%2FBF03329778.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0jnenXHSGKKrG7X5BjW18S)(This study does not support the existence of a weapons\neffect under the conditions described.\n...\nPerhaps the most parsimonious explanation for the failure to demonstrate the weapons effect is either that it does not exist or that it is an exceedingly weak variable obscured by a multitude of unspecified modifying variables.)\)
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Gun violence is a [symptom of economic inequality](https://talkpoverty.org/2018/03/29/gun-violence-america-isnt-one-epidemic-several/). The US needs to overcome economic divisions before considering further gun regulations.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: It is possible to tackle access to guns and inequality at same time.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The US federal government has a discretionary spending budget of [$1.485 trillion](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-spending-3305763), which it could earmark for both tackling access to guns and inequality if it chooses.
1.1.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Any change to current firearm legislation is unlikely to be effective in reducing gun violence in urban communities unless the socioeconomic issues which underpin high rates are [recognised](https://www.thetrace.org/2019/07/we-cant-end-inequality-until-we-stop-urban-gun-violence/) and addressed first.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Of all the countries with a higher rate of inequality than the US according to the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality), only Costa Rica and South Africa had lower rates of [gun homicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) per annum.
1.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: What's driving gun violence is not accessibility of guns in culture but rather [collapse of social and political trust](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-the-erosion-of-trust-leads-to-murders-and-mass-shootings/2017/10/06/382cc4b2-a91e-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8f538c351d93).
1.1.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: Research has found that declining trust in US institutions has lead to an increase in firearm related homicide, including mass murder \([p. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6917210/pdf/pmed.1002978.pdf)\).
1.1.2.3.3. Con: The [Dickey](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-gun-research-funding-20160614-snap-story.html)(Congress then passed a measure drafted by then-Rep. Jay Dickey \(R-Ark.\) forbidding the CDC to spend funds “to advocate or promote gun control.” \(The NRA initially hoped to eradicate the injury center entirely.\)) and [Tiahrt](https://www.propublica.org/article/five-federal-policies-on-guns-you-never-heard-of)(But those sanctions sparked a backlash: Since 2003, the Tiahrt Amendments, so named after the former Kansas Republican congressman who introduced the measures, have concealed the database from the public. Prior to 2010, local police could access the database only to investigate an individual crime but not to look for signs of broader criminal activity.) Amendments have made it [nearly](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Politics/story?id=3235565&page=1) [impossible](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/america-still-doesnt-good-data-guns/) for government to sufficiently research or analyse gun violence statistics to support or refute this point.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: The [Tiahrt Amendments](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/federal-law/other-laws/tiahrt-amendments/)(- Prohibit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \(ATF\) from releasing firearm trace data for use by cities, states, researchers, litigants and members of the public;\n- Require the Federal Bureau of Investigation to destroy all approved gun purchaser records within 24 hours; and\n- Prohibit ATF from requiring gun dealers to submit their inventories to law enforcement.) undermine the collection of data pertaining to gun sales by requiring the destruction or witholding of all approved gun purchaser records.
1.1.2.3.3.2. Con: The [Tiahrt Amendments](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20130115/the-tiahrt-amendment-on-firearms-traces-protecting-gun-owners-privacy-and-law-enforcement-safety) only protect the data of legal firearm sales and prevents the analysis of data unrelated to criminal activity.
1.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California argued that repealing the [Tiahrt Restrictions](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5271/text)(The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by barring the Government from requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops.) would empower law enforcement to address the rising concerns of gun violence in the US in 2018.
1.1.2.3.3.4. Con: Despite the Dickey Amendment, gun violence research in recent years has actually [increased](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/12/609701029/researchers-tackle-gun-violence-despite-lack-of-federal-funding).
1.1.2.3.3.5. Con: The US government has continued to [fund gun violence research](https://www.thedailybeast.com/with-5-million-dollars-from-the-nih-a-team-of-researchers-will-study-ways-to-prevent-child-gun-deaths) through the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/).
1.1.2.4. Pro: Industrialized countries with strict gun control laws have [fewer instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#By_region) of gun-related homicide than the US.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Australia substantially reduced the number of firearms in public hands through [buyback incentives](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/mar/20/strict-firearm-laws-reduce-gun-deaths-heres-the-evidence) and other programs.
1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that the Australian experience with gun buybacks would be replicable in the US \([p. 3](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2012/10/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: The number of firearms in the US is far greater than in Australia. Even if the [Australian plan](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/0623/Why-Australia-isn-t-a-model-for-US-gun-control) was implemented and worked perfectly, there would still be over 200 million guns in the US.
1.1.2.4.1.2. Con: Gun control [has not](http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/gun-city/day1.html) been effective in Australia.
1.1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: While there are reasons to be concerned about gaps in the laws and their enforcement, the general expert conclusion is that they were incredibly effective \([p. 1](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2012/10/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: Australia now has [more firearms](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/australia-has-more-guns-than-before-port-arthur-massacre/7366360) in public possession than before the buyback.
1.1.2.4.1.2.3. Pro: Australia reduced the number of guns legally owned by the public, but the black market has [steadily been growing](https://10daily.com.au/news/crime/a190107jxk/rogue-gun-dealers-operating-in-australia-20190114) leading to more and [more criminals being armed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-44105129).
1.1.2.4.1.2.3.1. Con: While the rate of gun crime has increased since laws were first strengthened in 1996, this more reflects [the erosion of Australia's gun control regime](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/former-prime-minister-john-howard-slams-erosion-of-gun-control-laws-20150908-gjhqhd.html), rather than inherent flaws in its original design.
1.1.2.4.1.2.4. Con: Gun control legislation has been effective at minimizing the risk of [mass shootings](https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/03/13/gun-laws-stopped-mass-shootings-in-australia.html).
1.1.2.4.1.3. Pro: In the 18 years prior to gun law reforms restricting the use of, ownership of, and availability of firearms, Australia had [13](https://amp.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/03/did_gun_control_stop_mass_shootings_in_australia_probably.html?via=gdpr-consent)(Still, the past five years have brought some additional clarity. And one core fact has remained strikingly unchanged: In the 18 years before Port Arthur, Australia witnessed 13 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which five or more people were killed. In the 21 years since, there have been none.) mass shootings. Since the 1996 reforms, there have been none.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: The Canadian government invested multi-millions of dollars to adopt a [strict gun licensing program](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/canada.php) that had no significant effect on firearm homicides.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: All guns are [tightly controlled](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10220974) and must be licensed in the UK, so it is difficult for criminals to acquire guns.
1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The UK has strict gun control laws which result in only [5.03](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country) guns per 100 citizens.
1.1.2.4.3.1.1. Con: [UK gun control has not decreased violence](https://crimeresearch.org/2016/04/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/), but changed the choice of weapon, which is essentially a failure of gun control as a method to reduce violence overall.
1.1.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: In 2017 the UK rate of gun deaths would equate to 0.23 per 300,000 population. In comparison, the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) exhibited a much higher rate of 12.21 per 300,000 population.
1.1.2.4.3.1.3. Pro: Since implementing strict gun laws in [1996](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/04/world/gun-control-uk-australia/index.html), the UK has not had a mass shooting.
1.1.2.4.3.1.4. Pro: Regulation in Scotland following a mass shooting led to a reduction in firearm incidents by over [75%.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38143327)
1.1.2.4.4. Pro: The rate of gun deaths in the US is problematically high.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Con: Compared globally, US has only the [10th highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate#List) number of gun-related deaths per 100,000 population.
1.1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: In 2012, guns were responsible for [60%](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604) of homicide deaths in the US which is double the gun-related homicide rate in Canada.
1.1.2.4.4.1.2. Con: Given the [relative size](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/#dataTable) of the US population compared to the countries in Europe and Russia, the gun-related death rate and public shooting frequency in the US are abnormally high.
1.1.2.4.4.2. Pro: [In 2012](https://qz.com/681683/harvard-researchers-uncover-what-happens-with-gun-us-laws-after-mass-shootings/), in the US, the number of gun murders per capita was nearly 30 times that in the UK \(2.9 per 100,000 compared with just 0.1\).
1.1.2.4.4.3. Pro: On an average day, [96](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/10/opinion/editorials/gun-violence-pulse-orlando.html) Americans are killed by guns.
1.1.2.4.5. Con: Mexico has [relatively strict](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-buy-legal-gun-store-2015-8) gun laws, yet the gun homicide [rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_guns_and_homicide) is significantly higher in Mexico than the US.
1.1.2.4.5.1. Con: Most Mexican gun crimes are committed with [American guns](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-parsons-us-guns-abroad-20180206-story.html).
1.1.2.4.5.1.1. Pro: Many US sourced firearms are illegally [exported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling_of_firearms_into_Mexico) to Mexico.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2. Pro: [70%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) of guns recovered from criminal investigations in Mexico were purchased legally in the US, often through [straw purchasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_purchase) and without background checks.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Legislation could be passed which targets straw purchases without having to adopt strict universal gun regulations.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.2. Pro: Access to American weapons directly impacts the gun-related murder rate in [Mexico](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-223).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: It is estimated that [213,000](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) guns are smuggled into Mexico from the US every year.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3. Pro: Individuals and gangs abuse weak US gun laws to acquire guns when they cannot get guns in places with strong gun laws. Adopting stricter universal gun control regulations would address this.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1. Con: The majority of gun owners obtain their guns legally, while most criminals obtain their guns [illegally](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-sales-how-dangerous-people-get-weapons/).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Data collected from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \(ATF\) indicates that the majority of firearms recovered by law enforcement can be traced back to [legal](https://www.atf.gov/news/pr/atf-releases-2016-us-firearms-trace-data-report)(In 2016, 289,223 firearms were recovered and traced in the United States, of which 211,384 were traced to a final retail purchaser.) but unregulated gun sales.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: In 2016, only 1.3% of inmates accused of either participating in an act of violence with a gun or actively shooting it had gotten it from a retail seller, while less than 8% had used their own names \([p. 8-9](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It is possible that survey data provided by inmates is unreliable because it only accounts for the last gun sale before a crime is committed, and leaves out the chain of [straw purchases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_purchase) that preceded it.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con: While only 10% of inmates report buying guns from retail sellers themselves, the remaining 90% obtain their weapons through unregulated and [questionably legal](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-sales-how-dangerous-people-get-weapons/) straw sales or sharing arrangements.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Despite both federal and statewide gun control legislation, more than 80% of firearms used in mass shootings in the US over the last 40 years were [acquired legally](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/more-80-percent-guns-used-mass-shootings-obtained-legally-n474441).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The majority of guns used to commit crimes can be traced back to states with [weak](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/crime-guns/trafficking-straw-purchasing/) gun regulations, which means that they are legal but would likely be impacted by new universal gun control measures.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The presence of guns in areas with strict gun control legislation can usually be traced back to gun sales in areas with [lenient gun regulations](https://www.csgv.org/myth-black-market/).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Many US gun traders abuse weak gun laws in neighboring states in order to traffic in firearms across [state lines](https://www.everytown.org/issues/gun-trafficking/)(States with weak gun laws often serve as suppliers of crime guns in states with stronger gun laws and within their own states.).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Katie Couric's documentary [Under the Gun](https://underthegunmovie.com/) attempted to establish that federal and state gun laws can easily be circumvented, but was criticized for editing footage to disparage gun advocates.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Katie Couric has been accused of committing at least four [federal felonies](https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/03/katie-courics-anti-gun-producers-repeatedly-violated-federal-gun-laws/) for buying and trafficking firearms while making the documentary.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Gun advocacy groups](https://www.nssf.org/nssf-statement-on-under-the-gun/) called for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Forearms and Explosives \(ATF\) to investigate Katie Couric.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The ATF declined to conduct a formal investigation of Katie Couric because they claimed it was [unclear](https://freebeacon.com/issues/gun-group-calls-for-investigation-into-documentary/) whether a violation of the law had occurred.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The creators of Under the Gun issued a formal [apology](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/26/479655743/manipulative-editing-reflects-poorly-on-couric-and-her-gun-documentary) in response to allegations of editing audio to make the interviewee look ill-prepared.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The [criticisms](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/under-gun-direct-soechtig-doc-filmmaker-james-20160603-column.html) of Katie Couric's documentary only undermine her credibility as a producer, and do not address the evidence being presented.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Chicago's strict gun laws are [undermined](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-laws-stop-at-state-lines-but-guns-dont/) by the comparatively lax laws of Indiana and Wisconsin.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: More than 20% of all guns in Chicago are purchased [legally in Indiana](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/chicago-gun-trace-report-2017/27140/), which has much more relaxed gun laws.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In the UK, police and border officials [struggle to stop illegal guns](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/27/police-struggle-to-stop-flood-of-firearms-into-uk) from being smuggled across the border.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: In a [2015 report](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/mexico-losing-fight-against-illegal-firearms/), the Mexican government estimated that of the 15 million firearms in circulation, 13 million were illegally obtained from the US.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Nearly [all gun violence](https://www.newsweek.com/nearly-all-mexico-violence-fueled-illegal-us-guns-1453694) in Mexico is committed with illegal firearms originating from the US.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.1.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.3. Con: Unregulated [straw purchases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_purchase) only contributed to [5 of the 167](https://www.latimes.com/projects/if-gun-laws-were-enacted/) mass shootings in the US between 1966 and 2019.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Gun control legislation [specifically](https://www.latimes.com/projects/if-gun-laws-were-enacted/) changes what is considered a legal firearm purchase, thus directly impacting the percentage of firearms available to commit mass shootings.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Red flag laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law) would make it illegal for someone who has made violent threats or is suicidal to purchase a firearm.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: From 1966 to 2019, [red flag laws](https://www.latimes.com/projects/if-gun-laws-were-enacted/) could have impacted 141 out of the 167 mass shootings in the US.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: [A 2019 poll](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/20/752427922/poll-americans-including-republicans-and-gun-owners-broadly-support-red-flag-law) indicated that 70 to 77% of Americans across political lines support red flag laws.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: In May 2020, Oklahoma passed an [anti-red flag law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law#Anti-Red_Flag_Laws), which suggests that popular opinion may be changing in some areas.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: A strict [assault weapons ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States) would make it illegal to sell certain high-powered weapons.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: According to The Violence Project database, a comprehensive assault weapons ban would have impacted [38 of the 167](https://www.latimes.com/projects/if-gun-laws-were-enacted/) mass shootings between 1966 and 2019.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2. Con: The term "[assault weapon](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-a-glossary-of-need-to-know-terms-for-the-assault-weapons-ban-debate-2012-12)" is arbitrary and no longer designates a type of weapon.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: The NRA argues that the term "[assault weapon](https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/assault-weapons-large-magazines/)" is used to rhetorically blur the lines between legal semi-automatic weapons, like the AR-15, and automatic weapons.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Even if AR-15's are not automatic, they are commonly used to commit deadly [mass shootings](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ar-15-used-mass-shootings-weapon-of-choice-60-minutes-2019-06-23/) and thus worthy of strict regulation.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2.1.2. Con: The AR-15 is the [civilian equivalent](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ar-15-used-mass-shootings-weapon-of-choice-60-minutes-2019-06-23/) of the military-grade M-16, thus it is more [dangerous](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/14/ar-15-mass-shootings/339519002/) than other semi-automatic weapons.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: The [NRA](https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/assault-weapons-large-magazines/#_edn33) argues that the focus on the AR-15 is a political response to the failure of previous attempts to ban handguns.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2.2. Con: The term "[assault weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States#Expired_Assault_weapons_Ban_of_1994)" has been used in gun control legislation before and could be adopted or modified by new legislation.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: The [Federal Assault Weapons Ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Definition_of_assault_weapon) \(AWB\) of 1994 established strict parameters for classifying many semi-automatic weapons as "assault weapons."
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.3. Pro: Both the [Las Vegas shooter](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-guns-legally-bought-shops-background-checks-passed-a7979816.html) and the [Parkland shooter](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/15/florida-shooting-suspect-bought-gun-legally-authorities-say/340606002/) obtained their weapons legally.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.4. Pro: Data collected from [2009 to 2018](https://everytownresearch.org/massshootingsreports/mass-shootings-in-america-2009-2019/) establishes a trend that one third of mass shootings in the US are committed by guns that have been legally purchased by someone who cannot legally possess a firearm. Strict universal gun control legislation would help resolve this problem.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Strict gun control legislation will drive gun sales [underground](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-schizophrenia/201805/the-simple-economics-gun-control), which involves illegally making or modifying guns and selling them on the [black market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2014/08/12/inside-the-black-market-for-guns/#3f92703f181e).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: Guns are [easy to make](https://gizmodo.com/its-becoming-frightfully-easy-to-make-untraceable-guns-1819076070) at home.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Many homemade guns are relatively [low quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm), and thus likely are not worth the time and effort to make.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: Guns created using a [3D printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printed_firearms#Effect_on_gun_control) are especially difficult to regulate.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: While the [Undetectable Firearms Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undetectable_Firearms_Act)(Various groups of makers and tech enthusiasts have experimented with the technology in this capacity as well, leading to widespread speculation that traditional methods of gun control will become increasingly inoperable.) prohibits the ownership of any firearms that cannot be detected by a metal detector, this restriction does not pertain to all 3D-printed guns, making them hard to control and regulate.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.2.2. Con: The plastics used in 3D printing are too brittle to make a functional gun, and metal-based 3D printers are too expensive to work as a [meaningful alternative](https://3dprint.com/139537/3d-printed-guns/).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: 3D printing can be used to make a [receiver](https://3dprint.com/54163/printedfirearm-ar10-piece/)(And because the lower receiver of the gun is by most opinions considered to be the central part of the weapon and is federally regulated, 3D printing offers a great way for gun enthusiasts and US makers to exercise their private right to make weapons without any of the process required when you go to a gun shop and are subjected to a background check, which is sometimes tricky even if one doesn’t formally have a ‘record,’ as other items can be flagged and cause not only embarrassment, but delay.), which otherwise are highly regulated.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: People can already buy [80%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_\(firearms\))("Unfinished receivers", also called "80 percent receivers" or "blanks", are partially completed receivers with no serial numbers. Purchasers must perform their own finishing work in order to make the receiver usable. The finishing of receivers for sale or distribution by unlicensed persons is against US law. Because an unfinished 80% receiver is not a firearm, purchasers do not need to pass a background check. The resulting firearm is sometimes called a "ghost gun".) receivers without serial numbers.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: Improvised firearms like [zip guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm#Zip_guns) can be made using household materials and are untraceable.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.2. Con: Selling a gun on the black market requires significant interaction with serious criminal elements.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Guns sold on the black market are likely to give [higher profits](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2014/08/12/inside-the-black-market-for-guns/#485fe3a8181e) to criminals, gangs, cartels, and the mafia which traffic these products.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: Illicit gun sales that take place in person come with additional risks like [violent](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/mechanics-black-market.asp) robbery or assault.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.2.3. Con: Prohibition of alcohol caused an increase in crime and corruption, as organized crime filled the needs of the market \([p. 1](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa157.pdf)\).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.2.3.1. Con: Unlike the complete ban of alcohol during prohibition, many guns would remain legal to buy and sell under strict gun control legislation, thus diminishing the possibility of organized crime taking any portion of that market.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.3. Pro: It is relatively easy to prepare a gun to be sold illegally. A gun can be made untraceable by using a [power tool](https://greencoin.life/how-to/scratch/serial-number-off-gun/) to effectively grind away the [serial number](https://www.thetrace.org/2016/07/how-a-gun-trace-works-atf-ffl/).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.3.1. Con: Scientists have developed a reagent that can [restore](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090536X12000809) previously obliterated serial numbers from metal surfaces. This may be useful to law enforcement in tracing defaced firearms.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.3.2. Con: Gun registration could be modeled after [automotive regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_States), which require annual check-ins in order for them to remain legally eligible for use. This enables products to be traced back to their owners and penalizes anyone trying to illegally modify them.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.3.2.1. Con: Canada [abandoned](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2013/01/22/canada-tried-registering-long-guns-and-gave-up/#47af4d55a1b9) their attempt to register an estimated 15 million '[long guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_gun)' after they failed to register even 25%.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Even when gun registration is not universal, [evidence](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/3/184) suggests that gun registration laws are correlated with reduced gun-related crimes.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4. Pro: Many areas with strict gun control laws have a [black market](https://reason.com/2012/12/22/gun-restrictions-have-always-bred-defian/) for guns.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4.2. Pro: The National Rifle Association \(NRA\) argues that firearms associated with criminal activity are linked to the [black market](https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/registration-licensing/), and thus should not be used as justification for gun regulations.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Many guns purchased on the [black market](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article164244757.html) in Europe come from the US, where sellers exploit weak gun control legislation and ship them oversees.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4.2.2. Con: Despite evidence that criminals typically cannot acquire firearms within states with strict regulations, the NRA uses the idea of the [black market](https://www.csgv.org/myth-black-market/) to campaign against gun control legislation.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: In 2016, a US Department of Justice \(DOJ\) report indicated that over half \(56%\) of firearms used to commit crimes were either stolen, acquired at the scene of the crime, or obtained off the street or from the black market. Only 1.3% were purchased from a licensed dealer \([p. 1](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=015849196504226064512:8qeg8tt4g1g&q=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwijqfzm79HpAhXiY98KHZQKDeoQFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw0Bb-4N_IH0oFQRdWrDyVnl)(An estimated 287,400 prisoners had possessed a firearm during their offense. Among these, more than half \(56%\) had either stolen it \(6%\), found it at the scene of the crime \(7%\), or obtained it off the street or from the underground market \(43%\). Most of the remainder \(25%\) had obtained it from a family member or friend, or as a gift. Seven percent had purchased it under their own name from a licensed firearm dealer.\n...\n- About 1.3% of prisoners obtained a gun from a retail source and used it during their offense.)\).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.5. Con: Guns purchased illegally are much more expensive, which incentivizes purchasing firearms legally \([pp. 83-84](https://www.nap.edu/read/10881/chapter/6#83)\).
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.5.1. Pro: In Australia the price of illegal semi-automatic handguns [rose significantly](https://www.ibtimes.com.au/cost-illegal-firearms-australia-has-skyrocketed-criminals-now-do-gun-sharing-1378871) after they were outlawed.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.5.2. Con: Guns [purchased illegally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2014/08/12/inside-the-black-market-for-guns/#2ca4cb0b181e) are not particularly expensive.
1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.

1.1.2.4.6. Con: While the connection between gun ownership and gun violence holds in the US, it does not hold in other countries. This [undermines](https://medium.com/handwaving-freakoutery/everybodys-lying-about-the-link-between-gun-ownership-and-homicide-1108ed400be5) the conclusion that gun control causes a reduction in gun-related murders.
1.1.3. Pro: If there are fewer guns in circulation, it is more difficult for one to fall into the wrong hands.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Illegal gun dealing relies on access to guns in the first place, or on inconsistencies in regional laws.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Federal regulations are likely to be easier to enforce than state or city regulations because state and city regulations can be avoided by leaving the area.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Gun control would help fight organised crime.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Evidence from other countries suggests that the rate of gun ownership in a community correlates with [a higher rate](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-guns-do-not-stop-more-crimes-evidence-shows/) of crime.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Strict gun control implemented in other countries, such as [Australia and the UK](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/10/how-australia-and-britain-tackled-gun-violence.html), has shown a decrease in recorded gun homicides.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Gun crimes have continued to [increase](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47157967)(Gun crime in four English counties was at its highest for a decade in 2017-18.\n\nWest Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Cheshire police handled more incidents than in any year since 2007-08.) for at least four counties, reaching their highest rates in 2017-18.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: While Britain had a relatively low homicide rate before banning firearms in 1996, the murder rate in Britain increased after the ban and [spiked](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/) in 2002/2003 before returning to normal.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: In 2002, UK homicide rates hit their highest of the last 25 years at [1.87](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/murder-homicide-rate) deaths per 100,000.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2. Con: The increase in homicide rates following the introduction of new gun regulations in the UK in 1996 is likely the result of complicating circumstances that were on the rise prior to regulation, like [increases in gang activity and criminal gun use](https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-does-gun-control-work-18374).
1.1.3.2.1.1.2.3. Con: Crime reporting standards in the UK were changed in 2002, which made data collected up and to that point incomparable to the data collected after the change \([p. 46](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135844/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs11/hosb0111.pdf)\).
1.1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Once the complicating factors had abated, [gun crime in the UK](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/firearms-act-twenty-years-on-has-it-made-a-difference-dunblane-port-arthur-a8110911.html) continuously declined following the implementation of the Firearms Act.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: In [Jamaica](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/), the homicide rate rose substantially after the implementation of [gun control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_Act_\(Jamaica\)).
1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: This appears to have far more to do with [inadequate enforcement](https://oklahoman.com/article/3379650/world-scene) of gun laws in the US, since many guns purchased legally in Florida are [shipped](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31474297/ns/world_news-americas/t/us-guns-fuel-jamaicas-gang-wars/) to Jamaica to be sold on the black market.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: While US gun laws regulate the sale of firearms from licensed vendors, sales and exchanges between friends or private citizens are unregulated in Florida. Unregulated gun sales connect legal firearms with the [black market](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31474297/ns/world_news-americas/t/us-guns-fuel-jamaicas-gang-wars/)(Jamaican authorities recover fewer than 1,000 firearms a year. But of those whose origin can be traced, 80 percent come from the U.S., Jamaican law enforcement officials have said in interviews with The Associated Press.) in Jamaica.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: In recent years, the US government has implemented [new procedures](https://www.stabroeknews.com/2019/11/14/news/regional/jamaica/us-presses-jamaica-to-plug-gun-pipeline/)(At the same time, United States \(US\) ambassador to Jamaica, Donald Tapia, has disclosed that authorities in the US are getting ready to ramp up scrutiny of cargo containers, one of the main channels used by criminal networks to supply their cronies here with guns and ammunition.\n...\nUp to 2016, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted traces on 1,509 illegal guns seized on the streets of Jamaica and found that nearly 65 per cent were either manufactured in the US or legally imported there.) to limit the shipment of illegal guns and ammunition to Jamaica.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: [Studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html) have demonstrated that gun violence and mass shootings are significantly linked to per capita gun ownership.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: A [meta-analysis](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/1814426/accessibility-firearms-risk-suicide-homicide-victimization-among-household-members-systematic) completed in 2014 showed that gun ownership significantly increased the rates of intentional and accidental gun death, as well as other forms of non-lethal gun violence.
1.1.3.2.1.4. Con: Although the country has since [relaxed its laws](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-brazil-guns/bolsonaro-loosens-gun-laws-in-murder-ridden-brazil-idUKKCN1P91PI), following massive gun possession restrictions [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list) had as low as 8 legal firearms per 100 people, yet still ranks top for firearm-related homicides.
1.1.3.2.1.5. Pro: Japan's [strict](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-control-how-japan-has-almost-completely-eliminated-gun-deaths-2017-10?r=US&IR=T) laws on gun ownership have [drastically lowered](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/) citizen [death rates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/).
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Prohibitions generally don't harm organized crime. In fact, [organized crime](https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2012/01/17/prohibition-and-the-rise-of-the-american-gangster/) has historically profited from them.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Gun controls have led to the [arrest](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-probe-mexican-drug-cartel-yields-750-arrests-n1156246) of drug cartel criminals.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Guns are regularly purchased in the US and then illegally shipped to gangs in both [Latin America](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/05/23/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america) and the [Caribbean](https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/the-third-border-american-guns-in-the-caribbean/).
1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: The US has no obligation to help non-US citizens or resolve problems in other countries.
1.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: [49%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/) of crime guns used in crimes in El Salvador were originally purchased in the U.S.
1.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: [29%](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-link-between-americas-lax-gun-laws-and-the-violence-that-fuels-immigration) of guns used in crimes in Guatemala have US origins.
1.1.3.2.4.4. Pro: American guns are [easily](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-mexico-guns-20180524-story.html) sold to Mexican drug cartels.
1.1.3.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.
1.1.3.2.4.4.2. Con: Facing well-armed drug cartels and strict gun regulations in Mexico, Mexican citizens rely upon [American guns](https://www.npr.org/2012/01/28/145996427/mexican-community-takes-taboo-stance-on-guns) to defend their communities.
1.1.3.2.5. Pro: Half of all violent crime in the US is related to [gang activity](https://mic.com/articles/27281/gun-control-debate-gang-violence-accounts-for-half-of-violent-crime-in-america#.PK3pgI39q) and the investigation and prosecution of gangs is made more difficult by the lack of strong universal gun laws.
1.1.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.
1.1.3.3. Con: Stricter firearm ownership laws will not effectively remove firearms from the possession of criminals.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: A [small fraction](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3jolDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&dq=what+are+known+to+be+a+small+fraction+of+gun+dealers&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt5ua9tdbpAhVYZxUIHQ8VBJkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=what%20are%20known%20to%20be%20a%20small%20fraction%20of%20gun%20dealers&f=false) of gun dealers are knowingly responsible for the majority of guns used in crimes in the US. Stricter regulation would hold these traders to account.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Without background checks and gun regulations in place, individuals suffering from severe mental illness can easily acquire deadly weapons.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Access to firearms by mentally unstable [people](https://time.com/5644147/mass-shootings-mental-health/) is a [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) that obscures the fundamental problem that most people have unrestricted access to firearms.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: In the US, only [4% of all violence](https://namimc.org/untangling-gun-violence-mental-illness/) is due to those with a diagnosed mental illness, meaning 96% of violence has nothing to do with mental illness.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: This source only considers [schizophrenia, bipolar and depression](https://namimc.org/untangling-gun-violence-mental-illness/). Accordingly, it cannot conclude that mental illness as a whole is not present in the remaining 96% of violent incidents.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The same source suggests that anyone who commits mass murder [cannot be mentally well](https://namimc.org/untangling-gun-violence-mental-illness/).
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This [source](https://namimc.org/untangling-gun-violence-mental-illness/) does not state diagnosable disorders nested under "mentally well." Another [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.voanews.com/usa/fbi-study-most-mass-shooters-are-not-mentally-ill%3famp) states that shooters are more likely to have mental health stressors rather than a diagnosed mental illness.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.2. Con: While mental illness as a whole is not captured by the analysis of three disorders, [serious mental illness](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml#part_154788) \(SMI\) is a term that refers to the severity of the symptoms is adequately represented by schizophrenia, bipolar, and depression.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Serious mental illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368430/) \(SMI\) typically refers to psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorders, but can also include extreme cases of anxiety, eating, and personality disorders that functionally impair individuals.
1.1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: Given that it is estimated that over half of those with mental health disorders are [never diagnosed](https://www.pasadenavilla.com/2015/10/06/undiagnosed-mental-illnesses/), it is possible that the available statistics on mental health and gun violence do not accurately represent the population.
1.1.3.4.1.2.2.1. Con: Given that only 4% of all violence is [associated](https://namimc.org/untangling-gun-violence-mental-illness/) with mental illness, it is unlikely that that even doubling the known instances of mental illness would generate a positive correlation between violence and mental illness.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: It is estimated that [around a third](https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/key-issues/violence/3626-serious-mental-illness-and-mass-homicide) of mass killings are carried out by individuals with untreated serious mental illness.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Mass shootings by individuals with mental illness account for less than 1% of gun-related homicides \([p. 81](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/appi.books.9781615371099)\).
1.1.3.4.2.2. Con: The Epidemiologic Catchment Area \([ECA](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ps.41.7.761?journalCode=ps)\) surveys report that, while [mental illness](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/10/the-facts-on-mental-illness-and-mass-shootings/) does correlate with an increased risk of some violent behaviors, only a small portion of mentally ill people ever commit violent acts at all.
1.1.3.4.2.3. Con: The connection between mental illness and mass shootings is [inconclusive](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/10/the-facts-on-mental-illness-and-mass-shootings/) and oversimplifies the problem of gun-related mass killings in the US.
1.1.3.4.3. Pro: In [2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/40), the Trump administation revoked a regulation finalised only [3 months](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-bill-revoking-obama-era-gun-checks-people-mental-n727221) previously that would have potentially added [75,000](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/president-trump-made-it-easier-mentally-ill-get-guns-when-n1039301) higher risk individuals to the background check database.
1.1.3.4.4. Con: It is already illegal to provide firearms to particular [felons](https://www.newsmax.com/fastfeatures/can-a-felon-own/2014/11/17/id/607940/) and people who have [certain histories of mental illness](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/mental-health-reporting/).
1.1.3.4.4.1. Con: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to a spike in gun sales in the US, which has put a strain on many gun control laws and revealed their [inadequacy](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/dangerous-gaps-gun-laws-exposed-coronavirus-gun-sale-surge/)(Just as the coronavirus pandemic has exposed gaps within the U.S. health care and economic systems, the surge in gun sales during this period brings to the forefront weaknesses in the current laws and systems governing the sale and ownership of firearms and ammunition. Far too many gun sales are allowed to proceed without background checks, and gun owners face minimal legal requirements to ensure that guns are handled and stored safely.).
1.1.4. Con: Gun control legislation limits our capacity for self-defense.
1.1.4.1. Con: There are safer and more effective methods of self-defense than using firearms.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Guns are an effective [last resort](https://www.gunnuts.net/2015/12/24/lethal-force-is-a-last-resort/) to ensuring survival while trying to defend oneself.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Discharging a firearm is an effective and reliable last resort for self-defense if it is justified by the fervent [belief](https://www.gunnuts.net/2015/12/24/lethal-force-is-a-last-resort/) that someone is likely to die or be seriously injured otherwise.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: In [most cases](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/guns-self-defense-study_n_7608350), there is no evidence that having a gun aids in self-defense.
1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: [Historically](http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2012a/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/5de089825c00843e872579b80079912d/$FILE/SenState0305AttachB.pdf), criminals claimed to have been deterred from committing certain crimes due to the fear of their victim being armed.
1.1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Victims carrying a firearm for self-defense are often unable to protect themselves from, and are more likely than an unarmed victim to be shot during, an assault \([pp. 2034, 2037](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759797/pdf/2034.pdf)(Results. After adjustment, individuals in possession of a gun were 4.46 \(P \< .05\) times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not in possession. Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 \(P \< .05\). \nConclusions. On average, guns did not protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses occur each year, the probability of success may be low for civilian gun users in urban areas. Such users should reconsider their possession of guns or, at least, understand that regular possession necessitates careful safety countermeasures.\n...\nOn average, guns did not seem to protect those who possessed them from being shot in an assault. Although successful defensive gun uses can and do occur, 33,57 the findings of this study do not support the perception that such successes are likely.)\).
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: [Tasers](https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/blog/taser-self-defense/), [locks, and other security systems](https://www.safety.com/8-burglar-deterrents-to-consider-and-5-to-avoid/) are effective crime deterrents which do not carry the [risks](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home/) associated with keeping a firearm for defense.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Tasers [do not always work](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/04/01/breaking-news/tasers-often-dont-work-review-of-lapd-incidents-finds/).
1.1.4.2. Pro: Gun owners need guns to protect their family and loved ones, as well as themselves.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The instances of violent crimes are on the [rise in the US](https://popcenter.asu.edu/content/home-invasion-robbery-0). Given these threats, gun owners can effectively deter those who attempt to harm their family or loved ones.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Occurrences of robberies in the US have [declined](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/robbery) in recent years.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: There were an estimated 319,356 robberies nationwide in the US in [2017](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/robbery), indicating a 4% decrease from the 2016 estimate.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: In [2016](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gun-sales-how-dangerous-people-get-weapons/), there was a 3.4% rise in the violent crime rate in the US, the largest single-year gain in 25 years.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Trained professionals should be the ones responding to situations, as citizen defense could cause confusion and further complication.
1.1.4.2.2.1. Con: Armed citizens can save lives during a mass shooting.
1.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: An FBI study of [160 active shooter incidents](http://theweek.com/articles/585837/truth-about-guns-selfdefense) found that just 7 of them were stopped by an armed civilian - and 6 of those 7 were armed security guards or off-duty police officers.
1.1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: The presence of armed civilians with weapons drawn during a shooting event makes it difficult for the police to differentiate the active shooter from concerned citizens, and could result in mistaken injury or [death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46434717).
1.1.4.2.2.1.3. Pro: In Chicago an Uber driver potentially [stopped](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-driver-with-concealed-handgun-prevents-mass-shooting-in-chicago-2015-4?r=US&IR=T) a mass shooting after he shot a gunman who had opened fire on a crowd.
1.1.4.2.2.1.4. Pro: There have been several cases of [armed civilians](https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-church-shooting-not-the-first-time-a-good-guy-with-gun-takes-down-mass-shooter) limiting church shootings.
1.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Most civilians do not have advanced deescalation and/or crisis training, and are far more likely to exacerbate a bad situation by making misjudgments in the stress of a crisis.
1.1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: De-escalation training is irrelevant to an active shooter situation, as the person is already attempting to murder as many people as possible.
1.1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Given that mass shootings tend to create panic and chaotic situations in crowds, it is incredibly likely that many of those missed shots will hit innocent people.
1.1.4.2.2.2.3. Pro: If an armed individual were to fire upon the perceived shooter, they could draw the fire of other defenders and potentially fire upon innocent persons in the area.
1.1.4.2.2.3. Con: In many places gun enthusiasts are as skilled with their firearms, if not [more so](https://havokjournal.com/nation/the-average-civilian-pistol-permit-holder-is-a-better-shot-than-most-cops/), than [police officers](https://bearingarms.com/mmcdaniel-bearingarms/2016/06/02/individual-safety-whos-responsible-n25711).
1.1.4.2.2.3.1. Con: During major NRA events, which attract many legal gun owners from around the country, gun injuries [decline by 20%](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/2/17070662/nra-convention-gun-injury-rates?utm_campaign=vox.social&utm_content=voxdotcom&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook), which implies that even experienced gun owners are frequently injured by guns.
1.1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: The majority of police officers have [never had to fire their firearms](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/744988/Most-police-never-shoot-study-finds.html) which suggests they have no experience of an active shooter situation.
1.1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Given that firearms training is expensive and optional, it cannot be assumed that the average gun-owning civilian is as well-trained as the average police officer, for whom [competency](https://mpoetc.psp.pa.gov/training/Pages/Firearms.aspx) is at least mandatory
1.1.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: Police are required to train with their sidearm [several times per year](https://www.policeone.com/police-training/articles/police-firearms-training-how-often-should-you-be-shooting-RNSWpyCwLzR9Csrf/).
1.1.4.2.2.4.2. Con: In many US states, civilians who have a carry license are required to demonstrate [proficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States) with the weapons they are licensed to carry.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: It's very difficult to draw the line between self-defense and the illegal use of force.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: The Criminal Justice System [differentiates](https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/self-defense/) between self-defense and criminal acts by assessing the presence of an imminent threat, reasonable fear, and the use of proportional force.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: A threat is imminent if it is ongoing, meaning that any act taken after a threat has resolved is considered an unlawful act of [retribution](https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/self-defense/).
1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: Self-defense laws are interpreted [differently](https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/blog/imminent-threat-mean/) from case to case.
1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: "[Stand-your-ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law)" and self-defense laws can be abused by bad-faith attackers, since, in many cases, the other party is not around to give their side of the altercation.
1.1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: Strict gun laws, such as "[Stand-your-ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law#Racial_disparity)" laws, often [perpetuate racial bias](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz8pek/stand-your-ground-laws-are-racist-new-study-reveals) and are more harshly enforced against vulnerable minority communities \([p. 2](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/backgrounders/RG-gun-mm.PDF)(- In fiscal year 2016, Black offenders were convicted of a firearms offense carrying a mandatory minimum and subject to that penalty more often than any other racial group \(52.6% and 53.8%, respectively\). Hispanic offenders comprised the next largest group at 29.5% and 28.5%, respectively.\n- Black offenders accounted for approximately 70% of offenders convicted of multiple section 924\(c\) counts and ACCA, which carry the longest average sentences \(327 months and 182 months, respectively\).)\).
1.1.4.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Between 2005 and 2013, juries were [twice as likely](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz8pek/stand-your-ground-laws-are-racist-new-study-reveals) to convict defendants who were accused of committing crime against a white person compared to against a person of color.
1.1.4.2.3.2.1.2. Con: 'Stand-your-ground' laws tend to [favor](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/stand-your-ground-laws-are-not-racist/) black defendants more so than white defendants.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2. Con: "[Stand-your-ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law#Effects_on_crime)" laws deter criminal activity.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Oklahoma](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.2015.1012027?journalCode=udbh20)’s "stand-your-ground" law reduced instances of private residential burglary.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: While Oklahoma's law reduced residential burglary, it [increased](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.2015.1012027?journalCode=udbh20) instances of non-residential burglary.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: In 2012, a woman in [Oklahoma](https://www.cnn.com/2012/01/04/justice/oklahoma-intruder-shooting/index.html) was given permission by the police dispatcher to use deadly force to defend her family from an oncoming home intruder.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: The [Castle Doctrine](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0011128712466886) \(a form of "stand-your-ground" law in Texas\) effectively reduced crime in Houston.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2.2.1. Con: The reduction in burglaries in Houston is attributed to the controversial use of the Castle Doctrine to justify the [Joe Horn shooting controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Horn_shooting_controversy). The crime rates in [Dallas](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0011128712466886)(The State of Texas enacted its castle doctrine law on September 1, 2007, and the subsequent Joe Horn shooting incident in Houston in November, 2007, served to publicize the Texas law to a great extent.\n...\nThe findings reported suggest a place-conditioned deterrent effect of the law and the Horn shooting; both residential and business burglaries were reduced significantly after the shooting incident in Houston, but not in Dallas.), conversely, remained unaffected after its introduction.
1.1.4.2.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: The [Castle Doctrine](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20120401/castle-doctrine-legislation-protecting-your-right-to-protect-yourself) gives citizens the power to protect themselves from home invasion while waiting for law enforcement to arrive.
1.1.4.2.3.2.3. Con: The [NRA](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20120401/castle-doctrine-legislation-protecting-your-right-to-protect-yourself) actively supports "stand-your-ground" and Castle Doctrine laws.
1.1.4.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The trend of the NRA [selectively advocating](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/the-nras-catch-22-for-black-men-shot-by-police/570124/) for white gun owners and ignoring incidents involving minorities suggests that the NRA only defends the rights of white gun owners.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4. Pro: "[Stand-your-ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law#Controversy)" laws empower people to use violence, making shootings more likely.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: There is [evidence](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/2/17050610/guns-shootings-studies-rand-charts-maps) that "stand-your-ground" laws increase violent crime.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: Authorities in Florida are refusing to charge a man for shooting another man for pushing him, under "[stand-your-ground](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/mcglockton-shooting-gun-owners-outraged/)" laws.
1.1.4.2.3.2.4.2. Con: Just because shootings may be more likely under "[stand-your-ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law#Effects_on_crime)" laws, that does not mean that those shootings will be less justifiable or in bad faith.
1.1.4.2.3.3. Pro: The right to self-defense is limited. For example, [in some cases](https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/self-defense), the victim of an assault has the duty to retreat and is not protected by the right to self-defense.
1.1.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: The ability to [carry a concealed firearm](https://www.usacarry.com/concealed_carry_permit_reciprocity_maps.html) is restricted in many states, and not all states allow reciprocity of that right.
1.1.4.3. Con: When compared to the number of guns used to commit crimes, guns are [rarely](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/defensive-gun-ownership-myth-114262) used defensively.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.2.1.1.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: A study shows that for every time a gun kept in the home was used in self-defence, there were four accidental shootings, seven assaults or homicides, and eleven attempted or completed suicides \([p. 1](https://www.hoplofobia.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1998-Injuries-and-Deaths-Due-to-Firearms-in-the-Home.pdf)(For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.)\).
1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: This only includes occasions when a firearm was used defensively to injure or kill an assailant. In reality, in around three quarters of all defensive gun use cases firearms acted as a sufficient [deterrent](https://reason.com/2018/09/04/what-the-cdcs-mid-90s-surveys-on-defensi).
1.1.4.3.3. Con: Various polls collected from 1989 to 1994 indicate that defensive gun use \(DGU\) data is under reported and [varies wildly](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/91da/afbf92d021f06426764e800a4e639a1c1116.pdf) from year-to-year and state-to-state \([p. 182-187](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/24c4/f535e8c05a916ecddd0c9c5ae20ec93f53bf.pdf)\).
1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: The defensive use of guns \(DGUs\) by crime victims is estimated to be [at least as common](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#6b2280af299a) as offensive uses by criminals.
1.1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: The [study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#71900120299a) estimated defensive use of guns annually could range from 500,000 to 3 million.
1.1.4.3.3.1.2. Con: The article points out that the number of defensive gun uses \(DGUs\) each year remains [unknown](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#35534f78299a), so it is speculative to claim that DGUs are as common as offensive gun uses.
1.1.4.3.3.1.3. Con: The article [misquotes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#35534f78299a) the CDC in order to discredit gun use data, claiming that the CDC's goal is to paint gun use as “dirty, deadly — and [banned](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/us/new-tactics-urged-in-fight-against-crime.html)," when in fact this quote was about tobacco.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Con: From [2007 to 2011](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiUn7OzvPrpAhWLTN8KHU2GD9IQFjAAegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjs.gov%2Fcontent%2Fpub%2Fpdf%2Ffv9311.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3ajEtKFAyesTQycWQxXUqZ), only 0.1% of victims of nonviolent crimes used a gun defensively during the attack \(p. 12\).
1.1.4.3.4. Pro: The [ratio](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_12_murder_circumstances_2008-2012.xls) of [justifiable](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expandhomicidemain) killings to murders, suicides, or accidental gun-related deaths was 1 to 32 in 2012, which indicates that most gun-related deaths were not the result of self-defense.
1.1.4.3.5. Con: The surveys used to estimate the number of guns used defensively are flawed because they leave out instances in which a gun is used to deter a [potential threat](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082#.VR606fnF-Sr).
1.1.4.4. Pro: The right to self-defense is only effective if it's a right to proportional self-defense. Thus, if a person is at risk of being threatened with a gun, they should be able to defend themselves with a gun.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: The right to a firearm is [not considered](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/07/is-stand-your-ground-unique-to-the-united-states.html) an extension of the right to self-defense in any other country other than the US.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: People only have rights to things they need for survival, not things they merely want.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Con: Firearm ownership allows people to protect their right to life, exercise liberty, and feel safe enough to live a happy life.
1.1.4.4.2.2. Pro: [Unalienable rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness) are rights to things like clean food and water, safe shelter, and free thought.
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: The [Dalai Lama](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) remarked that if someone has a gun and is trying to kill you it would be 'reasonable to shoot back with your own gun' but that one should aim to wound and not to kill.
1.1.5. Con: Decreasing the number of gun-related deaths is not necessarily a moral good. Some gun-related deaths are justified.
1.1.5.1. Pro: In the US it is legal to use lethal force in [self-defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense_\(United_States\)) if one's life is threatened.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.4.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Shooting an active shooter prevents them from killing more people.
1.2. Con: Gun control legislation is very difficult to implement effectively.
1.2.1. Pro: It is easy for firearms laws to lack specificity.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Current laws make it difficult to define the parameters of what [classifies](https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2019/09/21/atf-bump-stock-ruling/) various types of firearms.
1.2.1.2. Con: The issue of firearm laws lacking specificity can be resolved with more specific legislation.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Establishing precise federal standards, like a federal age for buying or carrying a firearm, could be [difficult](https://theconversation.com/gun-reform-finally-passed-congress-after-almost-three-decades-of-failure-what-changed-185942) because of general preference for state laws in the US.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [The average perpetrator](https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CPRC-Mass-Shooting-Analysis-Bloomberg2.pdf) of mass shootings is over 30 years old, which means that any legislation that establishes a minimum age to posses or purchase a firearm is unlikely to be effective at reducing these types of attacks \(p. 5\).
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Age requirements for licensing have been successfully used for regulating the use of [cars](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/graduated-drivers-licensing-programs-reduce-fatal-teen-crashes), [alcohol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310405/), and [tobacco](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/what-we-do/us/sale-age-21).
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Graduated driver licensing requirements [reduced](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2006/baker-gdl.html) fatal crashes involving 16-year-old drivers by 20%.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: A [gun licensing system](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/13/17658028/massachusetts-gun-control-laws-licenses) could prevent people from building up a cache of weapons. Gun dealers would be made aware of how many guns a person already owned before selling them more.
1.2.1.3. Pro: While background checks are technically required by law when purchasing a firearm, certain [loopholes](https://www.dw.com/en/8-facts-about-gun-control-in-the-us/a-40816418) within the law itself can enable these checks to be easily bypassed.
1.2.1.4. Pro: In Arkansas, it is legal to carry firearms while on a '[journey](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2014/03/13/ua-law-analysis-open-carry-law-is-ambiguous-also-all-or-nothing)', but the definition of a journey used includes any travel outside one's place of residence or county, which is unclear and difficult to enforce.
1.2.2. Con: The difficulty of implementing effective gun control legislation is cause for trying to improve the effectiveness of the gun control legislation and enforcement, rather than a reason to deregulate firearms.
1.2.2.1. Con: Before it's possible to enact new effective gun control laws, the problems of the current gun laws and regulations must be addressed.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Given the [existing lack of enforcement](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/03/06/enforce-existing-gun-control-laws-save-lives-editorials-debates/3065809002/), adopting stricter gun controls is unlikely to save that many more lives.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: There is a [poor rate of prosecution](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/03/mayors-against-illegal-guns/us-files-criminal-charges-fraction-gun-denial-case/) of felons in possession of a firearm based on existing prohibitions. Without enforcing existing legislation and studying that effect, adding restrictions to law-abiding gun owners makes little sense.
1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Felons who are caught with a firearm may face [weak indictment rates](https://eu.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2014/10/05/exclusive-violence-rises-prosecutors-bargain-away-gun-charges-indianapolis-marion-county/16760997/).
1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Individual citizens must hold their elected representatives accountable in order to see actual enforcement of [current laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state).
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Enforcing existing regulations does not need to preclude strengthening gun regulations and adopting new universal gun laws. They are not mutually exclusive.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: [Gun-free zones](https://crimeresearch.org/2018/06/more-misleading-information-from-bloombergs-everytown-for-gun-safety-on-guns-analysis-of-recent-mass-shootings/) have been targets of more than 98% of all mass shootings.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: Schools are [gun-free zones](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/gun-free-zones.html), which suggests that school and facility rules do not deter gun violence.
1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Strict gun control laws can improve the safety of gun-free zones by [regulating](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-control-research-how-policies-can-reduce-deaths-2019-8) the number and types of firearms that are available to the public.
1.2.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.2.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: The lack of consistent definitions of the terms "gun-free zone" and "mass shooting" causes the statistical results to [vary](https://www.journalgazette.net/news/fact-check/20180510/do-98-percent-of-mass-public-shootings-happen-in-gun-free-zones) from as a high as 86% down to 10% in the 2009-2016 period.
1.2.2.1.3.3. Con: Gun-free zones [significantly outnumber](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/state-law/50-state-summaries/location-restrictions-state-by-state/) zones where guns are permitted. Therefore, it is to be expected that events of any kind will occur more frequently in gun-free zones.
1.2.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects the possession of a firearm at home, but left it up to the states to decide how to regulate carrying a firearm in public \([p. 1](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf)\).
1.2.2.2. Pro: Laws and regulations rarely solve problems completely, but that doesn't mean that they serve no purpose. For example, while methamphetamine is still being manufactured, [drug laws](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buy-too-much-sudafed-and-you-may-get-a-visit-from-a-cop/) make it more difficult to acquire the necessary chemicals.
1.2.3. Pro: [Buyback programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_buyback_program) are widely debated and produce mixed results.
1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.1.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Buyback programs tend to be very expensive.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: A buyback of assault rifles alone is estimated to cost anywhere between [$3 billion to $15 billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/03/ban-assault-weapons-buy-them-back-prosecute-offenders-column/570590002/), depending on the price paid for each gun.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The buyback program enforced by authorities in New Zealand is estimated to have cost around $120m \(NZD\) - equivalent to around $80m \(USD\) - in [compensation costs](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12330293).
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Gun buyback programs are valuable because they both reduce the number of guns in circulation and provide a modest economic stimulus package to former gun owners.
1.2.4. Pro: Attempting to implement strict gun control measures is likely to create backlash.
1.2.4.1. Con: The possibility for backlash is not a sufficient reason to abandon a policy that could save lives.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Social progress and civil rights in the US came with the risk of backlash, yet the rewards have outweighed the risk.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Desegregation](https://eji.org/news/history-racial-injustice-resistance-to-school-desegregation/) faced significant backlash, but it was an essential step forward for the US.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: The lives that would be saved by enacting strict gun regulations \(such as [red flag laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law)\) would be outweighed by the increase in violent resistance and terrorism by anti-government extremist groups.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: The [Oklahoma City bombing](https://www.history.com/topics/1990s/oklahoma-city-bombing) was a right-wing terrorist act meant as retribution for the violent confiscation of weapons by the government in [Waco, Texas](https://www.history.com/topics/1990s/waco-siege).
1.2.4.2. Pro: In the US, the [fear](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272715000857) of gun control being enacted actually negates the aim of most gun control legislation, which is to reduce the number of available firearms.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Actually implementing gun control, rather than just discussing it, would solve the problem of people stocking up on guns.
1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.2.4.3. Pro: There are roughly [1000 extreme](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2011/02/23/us-hate-groups-top-1000) anti-government groups in the US, and many of those consider gun rights to be paramount.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: The existence of heavily armed anti-government extremist groups in the US is reason enough to enact better regulations for possessing weapons.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Right-wing extremism is an escalating problem in the US that is associated with mass shootings and [bombings](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/dark-and-constant-rage-25-years-right-wing-terrorism-united-states)(Far more attention in recent years has been given to the threat of homegrown radical Islamic terror—a danger that has generated such horrific acts as the Orlando and San Bernardino shooting sprees. Yet the very real specter of radical Islamic terror in the United States has existed alongside an equally serious threat of terror from right-wing extremist groups and individuals. \n\n \n\nBoth movements have generated shooting sprees, bombings, and a wide variety of plots and conspiracies. Both pose threats so significant that to ignore either would be to invite tragedy.), both of which could be positively impacted by new federal regulations.
1.2.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Right-wing extremists are already [well armed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_right_\(United_States\)) and maintain [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_\(social_network\)) useful for trafficking arms.
1.2.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.2.1.
1.2.4.3.1.1.3. Pro: Heavily armed civilian [militias](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/active-patriot-groups-us-2016) are growing in the US.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Con: In the face of anti-government [terrorism](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2022/01/05/assessing-the-right-wing-terror-threat-in-the-united-states-a-year-after-the-january-6-insurrection/), the US has demonstrated a willingness to hold massive [federal investigations](https://extremism.gwu.edu/Capitol-Hill-Siege) and make targeted arrests. This suggests that better gun regulations may not be necessary for this purpose.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: The [narrative](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/05/southern-poverty-law-center-militias-gun-control/1964411/) of many right-wing militias is that the government is out to confiscate their weapons, which makes them especially sensitive to gun control legislation.
1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: Reasonable policy should be based on evidence, rather than on the potential narratives it could be used to create in radicalized populations.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.2.
1.2.4.3.4. Con: The US should not create its laws around the desires of extremist groups.
1.2.5. Con: Gun control has worked in many other countries.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Owning a gun is a [taboo](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/18/opinion/newtown-france-coste/index.html) in the mind of nearly every citizen in countries where firearms are only seen in the hands of military, police, security agents, or hunters.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: In places such as the UK, where gun control has been tightened over the years, people see the right to bear arms as a [relic](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170809/brits-vs-guns). Those who own guns are the exception rather than the rule.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Creating a cultural taboo against gun ownership will affect the behavior of future generations, even if it doesn't have an immediate impact.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: A cultural taboo against gun ownership would [alienate](https://psmag.com/social-justice/why-thousand-oaks-students-left-anti-gun-rhetoric-out-of-their-gun-violence-demonstration) people with conservative right-wing political views.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [political culture](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/04/mass-shooting-gun-culture-227502) in the US alienates right-wing views, which contributes to the continued emergence of extremists that react violently to a future that doesn't include them.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Violent extremism, whether widespread or rare, is often the result of [push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism#Push_factors) factors such as perceptions of inequality, marginalization or persecution, and the denial of rights or civil liberties.
1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: Reducing the availability of something reduces its social and cultural relevance. The social shift in acceptance of [smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236769/) is a comparable example.
1.2.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: Among the forces driving down smoking prevalence were the legal restrictions on smoking in public spaces, mass media counter-marketing campaigns, and higher taxes on cigarettes \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3894634/pdf/nihms541120.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.2.2.2. Con: Heavy gun restrictions are comparable to the strict ban of alcohol during [Prohibition](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/1920s-america/a/prohibition), which [failed](https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2012/01/17/prohibition-and-the-rise-of-the-american-gangster/) and created an illegal market for banned items.
1.2.5.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.2.3.
1.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.2.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.3.4.
1.3. Con: Free access to guns is a cultural characteristic of the US and thus should be preserved.
1.3.1. Con: Polls suggest most American citizens [support](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx) strict gun control legislation that is enforced fairly.
1.3.1.1. Con: Polls also suggest that most American citizens [support](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/majority-support-stand-your-ground-laws-poll-shows/) the use of guns for self-defense.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.1.2. Con: [Appealing to popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) is logically problematic.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Historically, some [laws](https://listverse.com/2017/09/15/10-worst-laws-in-american-history/) have been quite popular that were later deemed immoral.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Making the [hasty generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization#Hasty_generalization) that gun control is wrong in order to avoid appealing to popularity is also logically problematic.
1.3.1.3. Pro: About 75% of US adults [support](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/gun-licensing-law?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2) laws that require prospective buyers to get a license from law enforcement.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: A [2017 study](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304432) found that 60% of gun owners support gun license laws.
1.3.1.4. Pro: People would feel safer if they knew there were fewer guns around.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Government policy should be based on facts rather than feelings.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Actual safety often has no correlation with the sense of safety. For example, 70% of people fear flying, despite it being the [safest method](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/how-safe-is-flying-here-s-what-the-statistics-say) of travelling.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Con: When constructing laws, policy makers should take a wider view which incorporates the opinions and feelings of the general public \([p. 226](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=655065026069102015009064122014106074103013032009049037108065085108066106024099065076020005033013022048034027084016125010064122047041028055048118081102089098124004008046086071097081119004022074024094011024116072016126114000117007028066086080082107003126&EXT=pdf)\).
1.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: The feeling of safety provided by gun control is illusory, as there are many dangerous things that gun laws do not regulate.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Knives, cars, bombs, and [other weapons](https://www.businessinsider.com/12-outrageous-weapons-that-are-legal-in-most-states-2012-9) can be just as easy to use and as lethal as firearms.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Vehicles](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/03/world/terrorist-attacks-by-vehicle-fast-facts/index.html) can be used as deadly weapons and cause a similar number of [deaths](https://www.nsc.org/in-the-newsroom/2018-marks-third-straight-year-that-motor-vehicle-deaths-are-estimated-to-have-reached-40-000)(For the first time since the Great Recession, the U.S. has experienced three straight years of at least 40,000 roadway deaths, according to preliminary estimates released today from the National Safety Council.) as [gun-related](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/facts/gun-violence-statistics/)(41,000 Americans die from gun violence every year—an average of more than 110 per day.) incidents.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: America is heavily [dependent on cars](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2014/02/9-reasons-us-ended-so-much-more-car-dependent-europe/8226/), meaning that outlawing them would be [profoundly impractical](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9118199/public-transportation-subway-buses). The concern for saving lives is offset by this factor.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.1.2. Con: [Automobiles](https://medium.com/alkane-truck-company/the-evolution-of-u-s-automotive-safety-regulation-1b9bcce6e5ee) have been made safer by the regulations and laws put in place throughout history. This suggests that while regulation of deadly things like cars and guns are difficult to enact, regulations ultimately reduce the risks of injury and death.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: In response to automobile-related terrorism, laws and [regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/20/what-can-be-done-to-prevent-berlin-style-attacks-in-modern-cities) have been put in place to restrict vehicular access to pedestrian areas.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: As fatality rates in road traffic accidents have trended upward, new vehicle [regulations](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/calculator/factsheet/seatbelt.html) aimed at saving lives \(seat belts, airbags, no texting, etc.\) have been introduced.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.2. Con: Rejecting gun control legislation as a partial solution because it fails to totally eliminate homicide is an example of the [Nirvana fallacy](https://lifelessons.co/personal-development/fallacies/)(The Nirvana fallacy makes the mistake of assuming that a perfect solution exists, or that an idea or solution should be rejected because some part of the problem would still exist after it were implemented, or because an idea could in some way be “better”.\n\nThe fact is that there is no such thing as a perfect idea or a perfect solution. Every idea has flaws. If you wait for perfection you’ll be waiting forever.\n\nNirvana fallacy examples:\n\nPerson 1: “We should do something about gun laws”\n\nPerson 2: “Bad guys are still going to get their hands on guns no matter what. If it’s not guns it’ll be knifes, bombs, cars etc. you can’t stop evil”).
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.3. Con: Other methods of hurting individuals, like hunting knives or cars, can be banned and regulated as well.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.4. Pro: [Bombs](https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/ied-blast-targets-voter-registration-center-khost-12-killed) are easy to [make](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-homemade-bombs-are-easy-to-make-and-hard-to-trace-1521624601) and can be detonated [remotely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device), making them harder to defend against than guns.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Suppliers are encouraged to flag people who purchase the components needed to make a bomb, like large amounts of [fertilizer](https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-sends-letter-warning-fertilizer-purchases-explosives/story?id=12991048).
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.5. Pro: There are [many examples](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/stabbing-deaths-by-country) around the world of mass stabbings, showing that a knife can be just as, if not [more](https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/04/15/knives_can_be_deadlier_at_close_range_than_guns.html), harmful as a firearm.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.5.1. Con: A study found there to be [no significant difference](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2014/january/survival-rates-similar-for-gun) between fatalities from gun shots or those from stab wounds.
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.5.2. Con: Handgun-related murders outnumber knife-related murders in almost [every state 2 to 1](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/table-12).
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.5.3. Pro: Edged weapons like knives and swords are capable of causing significant amounts of harm in very short periods of time in densely populated spaces because they are not limited by the availability of [ammunition](https://lfb.org/knife-to-a-gunfight/).
1.3.1.4.1.3.1.6. Con: America has a much higher annual death rate from [gun violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States) than from deaths caused by bombings, airplane crashes, or [deliberate vehicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_homicide#United_States) [attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-ramming_attack#List_of_suspected_terrorist_attacks).
1.3.1.4.2. Con: People may feel less safe if they feel they are unable to defend themselves with their guns.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: There are additional dangers associated with relying on [melee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_weapon) weapons like [knives](https://www.knifefree.co.uk/know-the-risks/) for self-defense.
1.3.1.4.3. Pro: The knowledge that nearly any individual could be carrying a firearm at any moment leads [many people](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-gun-violence-gun-control-ar-15-victims-read-ap-poll-a7152556.html) to be afraid of going outside.
1.3.2. Pro: The US was explicitly founded on the idea that individuals have a right to own guns as part of a right and responsibility to resist tyranny.
1.3.2.1. Con: Rejecting gun control legislation in order to preserve past cultural norms commits the [appeal to tradition](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-Tradition) \(argumentum ad antiquitatem\) logical fallacy.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The US is built upon fundamental [distrust of government](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126028106).
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The civilian population of the US owns more than [three times](https://aoav.org.uk/2014/many-guns-gun-ownership-around-world-explained/) the number of guns held by its miliatary.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: The public owns an estimated [400 million](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2018/06/us-civilians-own-400-million-guns-compared-to-militarys-4-5-million-survey-shows/) firearms in the US. All the law enforcement and military stockpiles combined amount to fewer than [4 million](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2018/06/us-civilians-own-400-million-guns-compared-to-militarys-4-5-million-survey-shows/).
1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: The number of guns owned outside the military is not an accurate metric of the distrust of the government as over half the guns owned by Americans are [concentrated](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/the-americans-who-stockpile-guns/500564/) in 3% of the population.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.1.3.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: The fact that the US government was founded on a complex system of checks and balances that limit governmental power is not evidence that the founding fathers fundamentally distrusted the government, but is evidence of the value they placed on [compromise](https://www.ushistory.org/us/15d.asp) and collaboration.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: The modern conservative political movement is [partially responsible](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/05/24/451262/trust-government-trump-era/) for the level of distrust Americans feel for the government.
1.3.2.3. Con: Free and unregulated access to guns has never been a part of the American way.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: The [Old West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier) period in American history \(1850 - 1910\) had many strict [gun laws](https://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/mark-mellman/294353-even-the-old-west-had-gun-control), including laws against openly carrying weapons in certain towns and having to register firearms with the sheriff.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Over the last [hundred years](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91942478), the US has passed many restrictions on the purchase, sale, and use of firearms.
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: The “Conductor Generalis” used by sheriffs, constables, and justices of the peace during colonial and revolutionary times laid out the conditions for [disarming citizens](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kBnh4AUG60UC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=conductor+generalis+%22disarm%22&source=bl&ots=_26_Tf7zlH&sig=ACfU3U2r36Bxd91sQFd477k9ln2DJ09wcQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPsOODks3oAhUjTxUIHQxFA3wQ6AEwAnoECAsQMw#v=onepage&q=disarm&f=false), including but not limited to the action of affray \([p. vi](https://archive.org/details/conductorgeneral00park/page/n13/mode/2up)\).
1.3.2.3.4. Con: Free access does not necessarily mean unlimited access. It is acceptable to require a license to publicly carry a firearm but requiring a license to have a firearm on private property is unacceptable.
1.3.2.3.4.1. Pro: For example, in most instances it is legal in the US to drive a vehicle without a license on [private property](https://legalbeagle.com/6499776-laws-regarding-driving-private-property.html), but to do so on a public highway would require a license.
1.3.2.3.5. Pro: States have laws directing how guns are to be [stored](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/safe-storage/) and what age someone becomes [eligible](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/state-law/50-state-summaries/minimum-age-state-by-state/) to buy and carry a firearm.
1.3.2.4. Pro: The [Founding Fathers](https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/founding-fathers-united-states) of the US believed the right to a firearm was important, which is why they codified it in the [Second Amendment](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Second-Amendment).
1.3.2.4.1. Con: There are legal arguments that the Second Amendment does not guarantee the individual right to bear arms, but does allow for "[well regulated militia\[s\]](https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/2nd-amendment)".
1.3.2.4.2. Con: The [Second Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) was created when the US was dependent on an armed citizenry for national [defense](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/repeal-second-amendment-gun-control/), but in the modern day that role is filled by specialized institutions like the police and military.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: Gun technology has [dramatically changed](https://www.ranker.com/list/firearms-in-1791/rachel-souerbry) since the Second Amendment was introduced.
1.3.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: When the Constitution was written in 1781 a gun could only fire a single manually loaded shot at a time \([pp. 3-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0312-z.pdf)(Today guns fit differently in American culture: American civilians do own military-style firearms and use guns in crimes of passion, especially domestic violence. We use them in mass shootings. The most formidable firearm in 1791, a muzzle-loading single-shot firearm, is incomparable in use and\neffect to the semi-automatic weapons many Americans seek to\nregulate today.)\). Some assault rifles today fire up to [1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_fire#Cyclic_rate)(Typical cyclic rates of fire are 600–900 RPM for assault rifles, 1,000-1,100 RPM in some cases,) rounds per minute. As such, the gun law - in the context of the constistution - is outdated.
1.3.2.4.2.1.2. Con: The advancement of firearm technology does not eliminate the need for tools used for hunting and protection, and the right to acquire and possess these tools persists regardless of the time period.
1.3.2.4.3. Pro: The Constitution implies that it is the duty of citizens to [throw off](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) any government which abuses its power or becomes overly oppressive.
1.3.2.4.3.1. Con: The [Second Amendment](https://www.livescience.com/26485-second-amendment.html) was originally written to allow state militias to maintain arms and was included so that states under British rule were more likely to sign on to the new federal government.
1.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: The right to form a militia in the Second Amendment was not extended to private citizens until two rulings by the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) as late as 2010.
1.3.2.4.3.2. Con: In [Federalist 46](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._46), Madison used the notion of the state militia to argue that the government should be designed in such a way that it would never be necessary to overthrow in the first place.
1.3.2.4.3.3. Con: The right to form a militia in the US Constitution is often cited as justification for unjustified acts of terrorism and violence [against government officials](https://newrepublic.com/article/154931/conservatives-well-spill-blood-keep-guns).
1.3.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: [Timothy McVeigh](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Timothy-McVeigh), one of the individuals convicted of bombing the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, plotted the attack with militant militia groups in an effort to defend the Second Amendment from the tyranny of the federal government.
1.3.2.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.2.1.
1.3.2.4.3.3.2. Con: Even if the right to form an armed militia is misused, it is [protected](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-1/58-the-militia-clauses.html) by the US Constitution.
1.3.2.4.3.3.3. Pro: Anti-government organizations often make [unfounded claims](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-gun-history/) that gun control legislation empowers totalitarianism and thus should be resisted with violence.
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: Contradicting claims by anti-government organizations, many totalitarian governments rose to power through armed ideological rebellions by armed civilians.
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: The repressive [Castro regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution) in Cuba came to power via armed rebellion.
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: The [Iranian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) came to power via armed rebellion.
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.1.3. Pro: [Pol Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot#Civil_War:_1968) came to power in Cambodia via armed rebellion.
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.1.4. Con: Armed rebellions against oppressive governments helped form the democratic nations of [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) and the [United States of America](https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution).
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.2. Con: Polsby & Kates \(1997\) argue that the connection between gun confiscation and genocide is evidenced by the fact that there are no examples of modern genocides being committed against armed populations \([p. 1237](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1582&context=law_lawreview)\).
1.3.2.4.3.3.3.2.1. Con: [Polsby & Kates](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjHw8GO1tTpAhXKnOAKHdC8BOsQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenscholarship.wustl.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1582%26context%3Dlaw_lawreview&usg=AOvVaw34jjpBA0hFRHG9lRWYqMA5) reject the anti-government rhetoric attributed to right-wing militias and make a point to claim that gun control legislation does not lead to totalitarianism, tyranny, or genocide \(p. 1238\).
1.3.2.5. Pro: Due to the extent of this belief, America exhibits a [deepening partisan divide](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-has-never-been-so-polarized-on-guns/) over the issue of gun ownership and legislation.
1.3.3. Con: [Less than half](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/22/facts-about-guns-in-united-states/) the population of the US owns or uses guns. Therefore, it is hardly a cultural characteristic.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Only [thirty percent](https://news.gallup.com/poll/264932/percentage-americans-own-guns.aspx) of US adults say they personally own a gun.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: [30%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/264932/percentage-americans-own-guns.aspx) of the [US population](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/united-states-population/) equates to around 99 million people, which is a population greater than that of the largest central European country, [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_\(United_Nations\)).
1.3.3.2. Con: [Less than half](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/poll-finds-baseball-second-most-popular-american-sport/) of Americans watch baseball and yet it is characterized as an [icon](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/baseballs-place-at-the-heart-of-american-culture/) of American culture.
1.3.4. Pro: Strict gun control policies would significantly harm weapons manufacturers and vendors.
1.3.4.1. Con: It is immoral to place more value on the profits of the gun industry than on the importance of the lives lost due to gun-violence.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: All people have the right to life and guns empower people to threaten the lives of other people. The [right to life](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/29/gun-ownership-is-not-a-human-right) is more important than the right to own a gun.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Decreasing the demand for guns could lead to massive layoffs in the gun sector which [employs](https://www.nssf.org/government-relations/impact/) a significant number of Americans.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Companies in the US](https://www.nssf.org/government-relations/impact/) that manufacture, distribute, and sell firearms, ammunition, and hunting equipment employ as many as 149,146 people in the country and generate an additional 162,845 jobs in supplier and ancillary industries.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: The current US population is [329 million](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/), which means that around 300,000 jobs account for only 0.1% of the population.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: The potential reduction in the number of gun related [deaths](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-america/) in the US outweighs the potential layoffs caused by stricter gun regulations.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: Law enforcement and military purchases still account for [40% of revenue](https://theconversation.com/how-the-us-government-created-and-coddled-the-gun-industry-85167) for domestic arms manufacturers in the USA.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.
1.3.4.3. Con: There would be other economic opportunities for gun manufacturers.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Even if opportunities existed in the long term, in the short term there would be economic harm to gun manufacturers.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: Any shift in economic focus would likely require gun manufacturers to retrain their staff as well as discarding \(or investing in new\) unique equipment, both of which come at a significant cost.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: Gun manufacturers could begin producing other defensive products like [tasers](https://www.srselfdefense.com/blog/handgun-vs-taser-gun-which-one-is-better-for-self-defense/) and [salt guns](https://futurism.com/salt-the-gun-that-doesnt-shoot-bullets/).
1.3.4.3.4. Pro: Local manufacturers could still export their guns to foreign countries. Stricter gun laws in the US do not affect the demand for guns abroad.
1.3.4.3.4.1. Pro: Overseas gun sales already account for [around a third](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/24/politics/us-arms-sales-worldwide/index.html) of the total revenue for American arms manufacturers.
1.3.4.3.4.2. Pro: The Trump administration is rolling back regulations and red tape to make it easier for gun manufacturers to compete [overseas](http://www.newsweek.com/trumps-administration-looking-make-it-easier-sell-us-guns-overseas-667905).
1.3.5. Con: Gun laws in the US impact many non-US citizens and countries around the world.
1.3.5.1. Con: The US government has recently established that the needs of the American people should always come [first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_\(policy\)#History_under_President_Trump), which suggests that the impacts of US laws on other countries and peoples are not valued in US foreign policy.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: [Stephen Moore](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/24/525359256/trumps-first-100-days-tax-and-economic-policies) argues that the most recent 'America First' trend in right-wing foreign politics is crucial because the money that the US government spends on aiding other countries is wasted.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: [Stephen Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Lowry)'s arguments have been [criticized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/10/31/inherently-intrinsically-inevitably-flawed-case-american-nationalism/) for downplaying the negative history of white nationalism in America.
1.3.5.1.1.2. Con: Stephen Moore's arguments regarding the effectiveness of foreign aid for other countries [oversimplify](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/05/18/528558417/should-america-keep-giving-billions-of-dollars-to-countries-in-need) the global situation and downplay the roles America plays in global economic politics.
1.3.5.2. Pro: There are [over 76 million yearly visitors](https://uk.usembassy.gov/international-visitors-to-u-s-on-the-rise-infographic/) to the US who are [legally barred](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/may-nonimmigrant-alien-who-has-been-admitted-united-states-under-nonimmigrant-visa) from carrying guns and are potential victims of gun violence.
1.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.4.
1.3.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.
1.4. Con: Gun control policies infringe on various rights that the government has an obligation to uphold.
1.4.1. Pro: [Current gun control laws](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/race-and-criminal-justice/does-second-amendment-protect-only-white-gun-owners) unjustly infringe upon the rights of marginalized communities of color by failing to protect their Second Amendment rights. Expanding or adding new gun control laws could lead to further discrimination.
1.4.1.1. Pro: People of color in the US are disproportionately harmed by current gun laws \([p. 389](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjUi4CGrJTqAhVOJt8KHf0xCh0QFjALegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholarship.law.umn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1615%26context%3Dlawineq&usg=AOvVaw0SQYgfazxrjQ-Ru0OlQcMd)(Recent data showing that gun possession conviction rates for Black people in Minnesota are shockingly disproportionate to their percentage of the population—sometimes six times what would be their ‘fair share’12—provides strong evidence that the state’s law, and likely the many similar laws that have been enacted across the nation, are discriminatory in effect, if not in intent.)\)
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.2.1.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Black men are disproportionately judged to pose an imminent threat \([p. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004736/pdf/nihms779615.pdf)(Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in a post-Reconstruction era and has\nculminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today.\n...\nIn recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be “suspects” or “persons of interest.” The exploitation of these often-targeted victims' criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths.)\), and are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by police than white men \([p. 295](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/reader/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303575)(Death certificates identified 2285 legal intervention deaths \(1.5 per million population per year\) from 2010 to 2014. Among males aged 10 years or older, who represented 96% of these deaths, the mortality rate among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic individuals was 2.8 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than that among White individuals.)\).
1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: [George Zimmerman](https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/index.html) confronted and fatally shot Trayvon Martin against police instructions because he perceived him as a threat.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: While current gun law enforcement disenfranchises minority populations, gun control reforms [could](https://theintercept.com/2018/03/01/florida-shooting-gun-control-police/) be used to create new programs, [universal gun control laws](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/gun-control-racist-present-171006135904199.html), and practices that address these inequalities.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: A 2017 study found that states that have enacted strict gun control reform have significantly reduced rates of police officers fatally shooting civilians \([p. 1070](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303770)\).
1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.1.2.
1.4.1.1.3.3. Con: The [implicit bias](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32740523) which associates racial minorities with criminal activity is already widely exhibited by US law enforcement, thus any change in legislation is unlikely to alter this.
1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.3.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Current gun control legislation has its roots in [racial discrimination](https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/347324-the-racist-origin-of-gun-control-laws), which disproportionately prevents minorities from owning firearms.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: While acting as the Governor of California, [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) enacted gun control as a [response](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panthers-california-1967_us_568accfce4b014efe0db2f40) to the Black Panthers.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile), a law-abiding Black gun owner, was shot by a police officer while telling the officer he had a legal firearm with him.
1.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: The [NRA](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dana-loesch-explains-why-the-nra-didnt-defend-philando-castile) waited one year before making a brief public response to the death of Philando Castile even though he was killed for legally carrying a firearm.
1.4.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.2.3.1.
1.4.1.3.3. Con: The NRA has stoked [fear of minorities](https://everytown.org/press/real-news-the-nra-just-said-theyre-proud-of-shameful-race-baiting-ad/) in order to make people scared, and thus more likely to want a gun and be against gun regulations.
1.4.1.3.4. Con: While there is evidence of racial bias in the enforcement of [many laws](https://theweek.com/articles/912977/ahmaud-arbery-racist-history-loitering-laws), that doesn't mean that the laws are written in a discriminatory way.
1.4.1.3.5. Pro: The majority of prosecutions made under the [RICO Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act) targeted gangs with non-white members, while comparable groups with white members were not targeted by law enforcement \([p. 232](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1025&context=mjrl)\).
1.4.1.3.6. Pro: The licensing process can be [discriminatory](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/29/chicago-concealed-carry-gun-permit-law-disarms-poo/) towards minority groups. In Illinois, only eight percent of licenses issued have been to African-Americans.
1.4.2. Con: Stricter gun control does not outright violate the rights of citizens to own a firearm. It puts reasonable boundaries around them.
1.4.2.1. Con: The laws proposed would nonetheless limit the firearms available to even a law abiding, responsible person.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: People flying to New York have been [arrested for carrying firearms on their journey](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170811/stossel-report-reinforces-urgent-need-for-congressional-action), even when strictly adhering to TSA and Federal guidelines.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: Realistic proposed gun regulations in America won't prevent law abiding citizens from obtaining guns for self-defense, rather the changes prevent dangerous people from accessing guns.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.4.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: [Waiting periods](https://www.nj.com/camden/2015/06/nj_gun_association_calls_berlin_womans_death_an_ab.html) and [magazine capacity bans](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-court-strikes-down-california-gun-magazine-ban) inhibit citizens from protecting themselves.
1.4.2.2. Pro: While access to firearms as tools for self-defense is a fundamental right in the US, it doesn't follow that any and all tools should be freely available for this purpose. It is therefore reasonable to limit the legal access in order to address growing public safety concerns.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Just as the right of the people to [peaceably assemble](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/peaceful-assembly/us.php) can be regulated \(via permit\), guns should continue to be regulated \(via permit\) for public safety purposes \([p. 5](https://www.gao.gov/assets/600/592552.pdf)\).
1.4.2.3. Pro: The gun control regulations being considered simply expand the [current gun laws](https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/perspective-on-gun-control/) and thus do not infringe upon the basic rights of gun ownership.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: In [DC v Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller), the Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment limits the government's power to restrict the ownership, use, and bearing of firearms.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.3.1.
1.4.3. Pro: Gun control legislation effectively violates the due process clause of the [Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) of the US Constitution by infringing on the gun rights of millions of Americans without any of them first being accused, tried, or convicted of a crime.
1.4.3.1. Con: The lack of strict enforceable gun regulations undermines the rights and liberties of citizens who must live in fear of being shot or killed in public.
1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.3.3. Pro: The [Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Due_process) of the Constitution requires that due process must occur by law before the state may take away someone's rights due to criminal activity.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: The Fifth Amendment refers to [criminal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause#Criminal_procedural_due_process) and thus is only relevant for protecting the due process in the confiscation of guns in criminal cases.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: If the state wished to deprive someone of an illegal firearm, the state would have to follow due process in order to link the gun or person to a criminal act.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Similar to [eminent domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain), the US government can take private property if it serves a compelling government interest and provides appropriate compensation.
1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: In extreme cases, private property associated with criminal activity can be seized through [civil asset forfeiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Civil_asset_forfeiture).
1.4.3.3.2.2. Con: Eminent domain laws, like gun control laws, are unjust because they undermine the constitutional rights of US citizens.
1.4.3.3.2.3. Con: Eminent domain is [limited](https://www.mcafeetaft.com/eminent-domain-part-1-limits-on-the-power-of-eminent-domain/) and restricted by due process.
1.4.4. Con: The desire of a small segment of the population to own or use guns for leisure or protection is not imperative enough to justify not intervening against [widespread](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) criminal [gun violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States).
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.4.4.2. Con: [As of 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country), there were around twice as many guns per capita in the US as there were in 1968 \(over 300 million additional firearms in all\).
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.4.
1.4.6. Con: The US [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution#Living_constitution) is a [living document](https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/living-constitution), which means that it is subject to interpretation and can be amended.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Amendments can be altered or removed; the [21st amendment was ratified in 1933](https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=1205#:~:text=On%20December%205%2C%201933%2C%20the,unpopular%20nationwide%20prohibition%20of%20alcohol.), repealing the 18th amendment and thereby prohibition.
1.4.6.2. Pro: For example, marriage for same-sex couples was not federally recognized until 2015 when the US Supreme Court ruled in [Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) that every American has the constitutional right to marry.
1.5. Pro: Gun control measures are an effective way to limit the incidence and impact of mass shootings.
1.5.1. Pro: A study comparing the mass shooting rate with the strictness of gun control laws in the US between 1998-2015 found that states with weaker gun control policies had significantly higher rates of mass shootings \([p. 5](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l542.full.pdf)(The permissiveness or restrictiveness of state gun laws is associated with the rate of mass shootings in the US. States with more permissive gun laws and greater gun ownership have higher rates of mass shootings, and a growing divergence is noted in recent years as rates of mass shootings in restrictive states have decreased and those in permissive states have increased.)\).
1.5.1.1. Con: The study also found that gun control policy strictness only accounted for 3% of the relationship, meaning that there are likely other major factors worth exploring \([p. 15](https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&context=issr)\).
1.5.1.1.1. Con: One major limitation discussed in the study is the variance caused by different laws in each state, which would be addressed by strict federal gun control legislation \([p. 2, 5](https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&context=issr)\).
1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.5.2. Con: Gun control legislation fails to address the underlying [social causes](https://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/gun-violence-prevention) for mass shootings.
1.5.2.1. Con: It is far more difficult to regulate social issues than gun possession. Seeing as how both are required for gun violence, focus should be placed on the easiest condition to impact.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Focusing on economic prosperity would decrease [the number of homicides nationally](https://www.brookings.edu/research/want-to-reduce-violence-invest-in-place/).
1.5.2.3. Pro: Gun control policies fail to address the cultural issues at the heart of gun violence in the US.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Stricter gun control will decrease the harmful consequences of [gun culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_culture_in_the_United_States) in the long term.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Pro: US gun culture [endangers children](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/07/my-first-rifle-gun-too-young) by placing them in environments with unregulated and insecure firearms.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Children](https://everytownresearch.org/impact-gun-violence-american-children-teens/) under 18 often have easy access to firearms in the home.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Over 80% of children who die by [suicide](https://everytownresearch.org/firearm-suicide/) with a firearm used a gun owned by a family member.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Around [40% of adolescents](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2048699) in gun-owning households reported easy access to a gun and the ability to shoot it.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many states lack [restrictions](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/safe-storage/) on gun safety in the home. Of 11 states with laws concerning firearm locking devices just 4 require unused firearms to be locked at least sometimes, and only 1 prescribes the locking of all firearms when not in use.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: [A study published in 2005](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/116/3/e370.full) found that approximately 1.69 million children and youth in the US are living with loaded and unlocked household firearms.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: A [CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5209a1.htm) of school shootings carried out by students in the 1990s found that the majority of the firearms used were obtained either from the shooters own homes, or from friends or relatives.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.4. Con: Irresponsible gun owners are responsible for [children](https://www.nrafamily.org/articles/2017/12/29/3-ways-to-talk-to-parents-who-fear-guns/) gaining access to firearms, thus new firearm regulations would likely have little impact on the problem.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Owners would be more responsible if [regulations](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/child-access-prevention/#federal) required it.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.5. Con: There are [specialized gun safes](https://gundigest.com/article/gallery-10-great-fast-access-gun-safes-home-defense) that properly store weapons and are optimized for home defense.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Many of the most advanced gun safes commonly rely upon a [mechanism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcwebertobias/2012/07/27/unsafe-gun-safes-can-be-opened-by-a-three-year-old/#4ffc33ad5762) with known flaws, which has made them accessible to children as young as 3 years old.
1.5.2.3.1.1.1.6. Pro: In 2015, someone was shot by a toddler an average of [once a week](https://time.com/4074648/toddler-gun-violence/?iid=sr-link1).
1.5.2.3.1.1.2. Con: The [Child Safety Act of 2005](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/165) mandates that all non-private handguns must be locked and come with gun-safety instructions, yet has failed to keep children safe.
1.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: The change in behaviour generated by the implementation of tightnened gun controls will change cultural norms about gun possession.
1.5.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Government actions change the way people behave and respond to things. Even though the chance of a terrorist attack is much lower than gun violence, [many Americans fear terrorist attacks more](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/) because of the legislation surrounding both.
1.5.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Creating more gun regulations will not change cultural perceptions around guns. Policy is generally downstream of culture.
1.5.2.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: The culture surrounding [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act#Schedule_I_controlled_substances) use in the US did not yield to strict regulations. Given the prevalence of marijuana use in the US in spite of the risk of legal consequences, [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_in_California) [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_in_Colorado) have legalized its use.
1.5.2.3.1.2.3. Con: Given the congressional approval rating is [below 25%](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballotpedia%27s_Polling_Index:_Congressional_approval_rating) by most polls, gun controls could easily signal that the government is attempting to erode major constitutional rights for their own benefit.
1.5.2.3.1.2.3.1. Con: The approval rating of the US Congress has not reached 30% [in 10 years](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/poll-of-the-week-congress-approval-rating/index.html), which suggests that there is no reason to assume that there would be an adverse response to gun control legislation.
1.5.2.3.1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.5.2.3.1.2.4. Pro: When fewer people own guns, populations of people will consider guns less vital to their culture.
1.5.2.3.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.5.2.3.1.3. Con: Groups like the NRA are strong proponents of gun culture and advocate for [gun safety](https://gunsafetyrules.nra.org/).
1.5.2.3.2. Con: [Right-wing](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rise-far-right-extremism-united-states) militias and white nationalist groups have made stockpiling illegal weapons and ammunition a part of their culture, and stricter regulations limit their access to weapons.
1.5.2.3.2.1. Pro: Right-wing white nationalists are [responsible](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2019/08/07/473372/combating-white-nationalist-terrorist-threat/) for many of the mass shootings and acts of domestic terrorism in the US.
1.5.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.1.
1.5.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: [Every extremist killing](https://www.businessinsider.com/extremist-killings-links-right-wing-extremism-report-2019-1) in the US in 2018 had a link to a right-wing extremism. This includes [incidents](https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2018#the-incidents) such as the high school shooting in Florida, and the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue.
1.5.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: It would be easier and more effective to resolve these problems by thwarting right-wing extremism than enacting sweeping gun regulations because it can be done [online](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/working-counter-online-radicalization-violence-united-states) and would impact fewer individuals.
1.5.2.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: One way of dealing with the alt-right is by [shutting down](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/3/14486856/reddit-bans-alt-right-doxing-harassment) their online platforms.
1.5.2.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Cracking down on right-wing extremism is unlikely to be easy, as attempts to shut down hate speech online may cause a backlash that make the [problem worse](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-taking-down-web-sites-really-stop-terrorists-and-hate-groups/).
1.5.2.3.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Authorities don't have very many [effective tools](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748163825/authorities-have-few-tools-to-fight-far-right-extremism-online) for combating right-wing extremism online.
1.5.2.3.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.
1.5.2.3.2.1.4. Con: Gun control laws do not directly prevent self-radicalization \([p. 7](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-mYi61_zpAhU-TjABHeAxAqEQFjAOegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2004.04265&usg=AOvVaw0SFosPtn_uYIVObM7ckg11)\).
1.5.2.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.1.1.
1.5.2.3.3. Pro: Switzerland has [comparable gun laws](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/swiss-guns/553448/) to the US, but its gun homicide rate is significantly lower than that of the US.
1.5.2.3.3.1. Con: Comparing two countries without considering all other social, cultural, and economic characteristics isn't a solid reasoning to support a conclusion.
1.5.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: The [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) has a significantly less homogenous population than [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Switzerland).
1.5.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: Switzerland's population is wealthier and more isolated than the US population, which could explain the reduction in acts of gun violence.
1.5.2.3.3.2. Con: While Switzerland issues all men between 18 and 34 with a gun to be kept at home as part of their [military service](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21379912), Switzerland strictly regulates where guns are allowed and access to ammunition.
1.5.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Swiss gun owners cannot take the gun out of their home except to transport it to a [shooting range](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/switzerland.php), and cannot keep the weapon after the end of their military service period without providing a justification.
1.5.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: Switzerland has [mandatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Switzerland) military service which provides basic gun safety and responsibility [training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland#Army-issued_arms_and_ammunition_collection).
1.5.2.3.4. Pro: The US has many characteristics which make it more susceptible to violence than other developed countries.
1.5.2.3.4.1. Con: If a country is uniquely susceptible to violence, it would be prudent for that country to reduce the number of unregulated guns in circulation.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.1.2.3.1.2.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.5.5. Pro: Certain guns [make it easier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-capacity_magazine) for a violent person to kill several people before they can be stopped.
1.5.5.1. Pro: More than half of mass shootings were conducted using [semi-automatic](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/assault-weapons-high-capacity-magazines-mass-shootings-feinstein/) weapons with high-capacity magazines.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: [Less than a third of 1%](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525107116674926?journalCode=jrxa) of mass shootings are carried out using large-capacity magazines, therefore proposed legislation to restrict this particular type of firearm isn't likely to have a significant effect on their incidence.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: The deadliest lone actor mass shooting in the US was committed with a firearm that [simulates fully automatic fire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41482010), which indicates that a ban on automatic weapons is ineffective.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Guns can be used to kill [from a distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_range), making them harder to protect against.
1.5.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.1.3.1.
1.5.6. Pro: Mass shootings on US soil are increasing in frequency and severity.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The scale of mass shootings in the US has been increasing at an [alarming rate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2017/nov/06/not-your-imagination-mass-shootings-now-happen-more-frequently-in-the-us) and warrants legislative action.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: The [number of mass shootings](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/mass-shootings-increasing-harvard-research/#) has increased in recent years.
1.5.6.1.1.1. Pro: Around 20% of [mass shootings](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-09-01/mass-shooting-data-odessa-midland-increase) over the last fifty years have occurred in the last five years, including those with the highest death toll.
1.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: The [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) \(GVA\) has calculated the number of mass shootings in the US each year and identified a [positive trend](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mass-shootings-2019-more-than-days-365/)(In the end, 2019 had the highest number of mass shootings in any year since 2014, when the Gun Violence Archive started its count. It has surpassed the prior record of 382 mass shootings in 2016. The GVA reported 346 mass shootings in 2017 and 337 in 2018.) in mass shootings from 2014 until 2019.
1.5.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Defining a mass shooting as an event in which 4 people other than the shooter are shot means that there was a [mass shooting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence) on 90% of days between 1/1/2013 and 2/12/2018.
1.5.6.1.1.3. Con: Data on mass shootings may be misleading, since some definitions of mass shooting have been expanded to include incidents involving small groups of people and the use of [pellet guns](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/10/foghorn/shootingtracker-com-uses-pellet-guns-to-boost-mass-shooting-numbers/).
1.5.6.1.1.3.1. Con: The inclusion of 2 pellet gun incidents in the original calculation have been dubbed a glitch and [removed](https://www.thetrace.org/2015/10/mass-shooting-tracker-redditors-challenge-fbi-data/) from the data.
1.5.6.1.2. Con: The US is not the worst in the Western world for [mass shooting](https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/) frequency or death rate.
1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: [Comparing](https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe/) it with the countries of Europe, the US has [the eleventh highest](https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-Tuesday-April-5-1.05-AM.png) mass shooting rate and [the twelfth highest](https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-Tuesday-April-5-1.06-AM.png) public shooting frequency.
1.5.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Some of the deadliest mass shootings in US history have taken place [since 2015](https://wjla.com/news/nation-world/mass-shootings-in-us-compared-with-other-countries), which means they would be left out of this dataset and that the data is unreliable.
1.5.6.1.2.1.2. Con: It is statistically misleading to compare the US with countries in Europe in this way.
1.5.6.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The countries compared to the US very rarely experience mass shootings, which means that when they happen they have [outsized statistical effects](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/united-states-lower-death-shootings/). This means that this cross-comparison is distorted and misleading.
1.5.6.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Given that death rate and public shooting frequency are calculated by dividing the number of gun-related incidents with the total population, it is misleading to compare the death rate or shooting frequency in countries like the US with [large populations](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mass-shootings-by-country/#dataTable) to countries with smaller populations.
1.5.6.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.4.1.2.
1.5.6.1.2.1.3. Con: The [legitimacy](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/united-states-lower-death-shootings/) of the data and methodology used to compare the US and Europe in this way have been called into question.
1.5.6.1.2.1.4. Pro: Ranking the US in this way is supported by widely supported definitions of what constitutes a mass shooting.
1.5.6.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Mass public shootings are [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting#Definitions) by the FBI as incidents in which four or more people are killed in one location. This excludes those killed in the course of committing another crime and involving struggles over sovereignty.
1.5.6.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: While the FBI tracks [mass murders](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mass-shootings-2019-more-than-days-365/), which are defined as incidents in which at least 4 people are killed, the FBI does not have a formal definition of what constitutes a mass shooting.
1.5.6.1.2.2. Con: A [2016 study](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/27/health/u-s-most-mass-shootings/index.html) shows that while the US has only 5% of the world's population, it had 31% of all mass shootings between 1966 and 2012.
1.5.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: [16 of the 32](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248845/number-of-victims-of-mass-shootings-in-western-democratic-countries/) most deadly mass shootings in western democratic countries from 1966 to 2012 took place in the US.
1.5.6.1.2.2.2. Con: Mass shootings in other countries are largely ignored or not investigated by Western [media](https://nypost.com/2018/08/30/america-doesnt-actually-lead-the-world-in-mass-shootings/).
1.5.6.1.2.2.3. Con: The study has been criticised as being inaccurate and methodologically flawed since the author refused to share their [data](https://nypost.com/2018/08/30/america-doesnt-actually-lead-the-world-in-mass-shootings/) for peer review.
1.5.6.1.2.3. Con: The [Crime Prevention Research Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/crime-prevention-research-center/) is responsible for this [data analysis](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/united-states-lower-death-shootings/) and is as strongly politically biased with mixed ratings on factual reporting.
1.5.6.2. Con: The US is already safe and becoming [safer](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/here-are-8-stubborn-facts-gun-violence-america).
1.5.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.1.
1.5.6.2.2. Pro: While many international news outlets claim that gun violence is a threat to tourists visiting the US, it [remains safe](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/united-states-travel-safety/) to visit the US.
1.5.6.2.2.1. Pro: The US is very large and its [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Density) is relatively spread out, which means that there are many places to visit with little risk of experiencing gun violence and a mass shooting.
1.5.6.2.3. Con: There are many communities within the US who live in constant fear of gun violence and gun-related crime.
1.5.6.2.3.1. Pro: In 2015, more than a quarter of gun homicides happened in around 1,200 neighborhoods that house just [1.5%](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/12/20679091/thomas-abt-bleeding-out-urban-gun-violence-book-review) of the US population.
1.5.6.2.3.2. Pro: Individuals in certain US cities are [5 times](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-cities/) more likely to be murdered with a gun than Americans overall.
1.5.6.2.3.3. Con: If an individual or community lives in constant fear, it is the responsibility of that individual or community to take some responsibility and address this fear.
1.5.6.2.3.3.1. Con: Many schools in the US force students to undergo [drills](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/10/778015261/experts-worry-active-shooter-drills-in-schools-could-be-traumatic-for-students) in an attempt to minimise fear and confusion in the event of a mass shooting. While useful in principle, some drills are unscheduled in order to emulate the suddenness and severity of real school shootings and these can be very traumatic for the children involved.
1.5.6.3. Con: Regardless of relative rate, mass shootings remain fundamentally rare events.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: Whilst rare, mass shootings have had a lasting impact on the American way of life.
1.5.6.3.1.1. Pro: [Evidence](https://theconversation.com/what-mass-shootings-do-to-those-not-shot-social-consequences-of-mass-gun-violence-106677) suggests that mass shooting events can impact people who are exposed to the event through the media, which means that even isolated incidents with relatively few victims can impact millions of people.
1.5.6.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.2.3.3.1.
1.5.6.3.2. Pro: Mass shootings account for just [0.8 percent of all homicides](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/mass-shootings.html), this number is so low that it does not warrant the proposed legislative action to curb it.
1.5.6.3.2.1. Pro: Mass shootings statistically make up a very small portion of all gun homicides \([117](https://time.com/4965022/deadliest-mass-shooting-us-history/) out of [14,415 deaths in 2017](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm)\).
1.5.6.4. Pro: Six of the most lethal mass shootings in modern American history have happened in the last 10 [years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States).
1.5.6.5. Pro: The first recorded instance of 2 mass shootings taking place within a [24 hour](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/2-mass-shootings-u-s-leave-least-29-dead-53-n1039066) period in the US occurred on August 3rd in 2019.
