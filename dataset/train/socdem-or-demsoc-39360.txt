Discussion Name: SocDem or DemSoc?

1. SocDem or DemSoc?
1.1. DemSoc is best for America
1.1.1. Pro: Democratic socialist policies are designed to nonviolently move funds from those with the most \(far more than they need\) to those with the least. These policies will make it so that the poor won't be poor, and the rich will be less rich
1.1.1.1. Con: In practice, socialist transitions have been [violent](https://www.nccivitas.org/civitas-review/socialism-often-results-violence/).
1.1.2. Con: More theoretical, less fully applied policies
1.1.3. Pro: More thoroughly [realize the values of the Enlightenment](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/radical-enlightenment-philosophy-spinoza-materialism-marxism).
1.1.3.1. Con: [Socialist states](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/capitalism-socialism-and-democracy/) have historically clamped down upon personal liberty, one of the key values of Enlightenment, in order to achieve certain political or social goals.
1.1.4. Con: Policies enacted under democratic socialism will cost America [a lot of money](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/8/7/17658574/democratic-socialism-cost-medicare-college-sanders-deficits-taxes).
1.1.4.1. Con: Human life and thriving should be worth more than money
1.1.4.2. Con: Unecessary programs could be cut. \(For example, a majority of military programs\)
1.1.4.3. Con: Funds could be redistributed in order to fund new policies.
1.1.4.4. Pro: People will be required to pay [higher taxes](https://reason.org/commentary/the-tax-increases-and-other-costs-that-come-with-democratic-socialism/) in order to fund the policies under democratic socialism.
1.1.5. Pro: DemSoc extends the [principle of democracy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socialism/) to the economic sphere which is currently undemocratic and exploitative.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Countries such as Norway, Finland and Denmark have [democratic socialism](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/democratic-socialism-social-democracy-nordic-countries) in the form of welfare state. Yet, they haven't been able to establish democracy in the real of labour, which remains under capital control.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Without [democratic socialism](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/01/freedom-from-the-boss), democratic rights only apply to people's relationship with the state and not to their employer. The employer can limit people's choices at workplace in a way that coercive and undemocratic.
1.1.5.3. Con: People voluntarily choose to work for wages. They do it because it they [earn more](https://mises.org/wire/three-ways-capitalists-make-workers-better#:~:text=Working%20in%20a%20company%20for,to%20collect%20income%20right%20away.) than what they would have if they produced and sold on their own.
1.2. SocDem is best for America
1.2.1. Pro: Social democracy [recognizes the need to fix certain problems within capitalism](https://sarasotainstitute.global/the-case-for-social-democracy/) so that the economic system benefits more people.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Social democracy tries to achieve social justice without requiring a radical departure from the existing economic system. It is therefore more realizable because radical departures are [hard](http://isj.org.uk/left-reformism-the-state-and-the-problem-of-socialist-politics-today/) to achieve.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Scandinavian countries](http://www.alternet.org/books/there-are-good-alternatives-us-capitalism-no-way-get-there?page=0%2C2) have shown that social democracy can be successfully established and that it is beneficial for its citizens.
1.2.1.2. Con: Social democracy cannot solve the [fundamental issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_welfare#Socialist_criticism) that capitalism produces - such as exploitation and alienation.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Social democracy entails establishing welfare policies that assume perpetual [economic growth](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2015.1079169). In the face of challenges from climate change, such growth is not sustainable.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Efforts to reduce unemployment within a capitalist system through welfare can result in [inflation](https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm) and disturbance in labor relations.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: In the US, the income earned by labour has been consistently [falling](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/24/capitalism-is-failing-workers-people-want-a-job-with-a-decent-wage-why-is-that-so-hard). This is true also of other countries, some of which have social democratic policies in place.
1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Falling income does not necessarily mean that workers are worse off. A [study](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/capitalism-bad-workers) suggests that falling income could be as a result of using a proportion of wage as premium for insurance instead of direct income.
1.2.1.2.3.2. Con: Fixing a decline in wages does not necessitate the dismantling of capitalism. [Welfare policies](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/swedens-secret-keeping-wages-high/) enacted by a strong social democratic state can fix this issue.
1.2.2. Con: Social democratic policies reduce incentives for economic activity and growth.
1.2.3. Con: Social democracy enlarges the role of the state and gives it disproportionate power to intervene in private activity.
1.2.4. Pro: Keynesian reforms are means tested.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Historical data to show outcomes of Keynesian policies
1.2.4.2. Pro: In the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic, many countries chose [Keynesian economic policies](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/05/12/commentary/world-commentary/are-the-keynesians-) as the way to control rising unemployment and shortage in economic demand.
1.2.4.3. Con: When Keynesian policies are pursued over a long time, it results in an unmanageable situation of [fiscal deficit](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/12/japan-and-the-limits-of-keynesianism/68619/). This is bad for the economy of a country.
1.2.4.4. Con: Keynesian economic policies of [increased government spending](https://capx.co/keynesian-economics-falls-at-the-first-political-hurdle/) only work well during periods of economic downturn and should be pursued in periods of normal economic growth.
1.2.5. Con: Less people would be helped in general.
