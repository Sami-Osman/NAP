Discussion Name: Should quotas for women on boards and in managerial positions be mandatory?

1. Quotas for women on boards and in managerial positions should be mandatory.
1.1. Con: Gender quotas are ineffective and counterproductive.
1.1.1. Pro: Gender quotas cannot guarantee that women on boards and in managerial positions are taken seriously or considered for CEO or chairman roles in the long-term.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Evidence shows that when Norway introduced a quota requiring 40% of boards to be women, more women were elected to boards but the number of female directors in CEO or chairman positions remained steadfast \([pp. 138-139](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiZorPt7K_tAhWOEMAKHWsuDbsQFjAAegQIBRAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boardroomdiversity.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F12%2FThe-Quarterly-Journal-of-Economics-2012-Ahern-137-97.pdf&usg=AOvVaw237kYOeR-b-oehxYQifepD)\).
1.1.1.2. Con: A lack of women promoted to CEO or chairperson positions would not demonstrably indicate that quotas are ineffective, as they are only a subset of a wide variety of positions for which the quotas are designed. Quotas will ultimately still result in more women in board positions and gaining boardroom experience.
1.1.2. Con: Measures could be put in place to mitigate any potential negative effects of quotas.
1.1.2.1. Con: While they have the potential to limit negative effects, the additional extra endeavour of introducing such mitigating measures may still not be justified if ultimately quotas are ineffective at achieving any sustained or substantial change.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The Netherlands’ quota system has an expiration date. This allows the effects of quotas to be tested and gives women an opportunity to gain experience in these roles. Ultimately the quotas can be removed but hopefully will have normalised having women in leadership positions \([p. 17](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)\).
1.1.2.3. Pro: Boards can be expanded to add more women but not at the expense of qualified men.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: At a certain point, this will make boards unwieldy and may result in the newly added women being ignored by the men who have previously dominated the space.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: The [International Triathlon Union](https://www.triathlon.org/) stipulates that women occupy a certain percentage of leadership roles, but also allows for the addition of an extra board seat for every extra woman brought on board \([p. 17](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)\).
1.1.3. Con: In many countries, the [pace](https://eige.europa.eu/news/gender-equality-index-2017-progress-snails-pace) of natural change is simply too slow to allow diversity progress without state intervention.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Even if the current pace of change is maintained year on year, it could take up to a decade for women to occupy 40% of the board seats in Fortune 500 countries \([p. 25](https://www.diversitybestpractices.com/sites/diversitybestpractices.com/files/attachments/2017/07/fortune_500_1000_commitment_0.pdf)\).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: A decade is not a long time to wait, especially if the introduction of quotas could permanently change the way in which the contribution of women is valued once they reach board positions for the worse.
1.1.3.2. Pro: CEOs of companies say that they support diversity in the workplace, but only [45%](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/)(Though most employees believe their CEO supports diversity, just 45% think their company is doing the work that is necessary to achieve gender parity.) of their employees think their company is doing the work that is necessary to achieve gender parity.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Opinions are subject to a number of biases, including social conformity bias and popularity bias, so the opinion of employees who are not privy to the internal decision-making process of executives is not a credible indicator of executive performance.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: A [study](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) demonstrated that firms have afforded fewer development opportunities to women in contrast to men. This unfairly hinders women's prospects for promotion due to barriers in the workplace, rather than innate biological differences.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Even at entry level, men are [30%](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) more likely to be promoted to managerial roles than women.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Although women and men are represented equally at the entry level and lobby for promotions at the same rate, women are [less likely](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/) to get those promotions.
1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Women will often not [put themselves forward](https://www.ceda.com.au/Research-and-policy/All-CEDA-research/Research-catalogue/Barriers-to-equality-of-opportunity) for a position because they rate themselves more harshly than a male competitor might.
1.1.3.2.3.2. Con: There are other factors to explain why fewer women get promotions besides gender discrimination.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: Women may choose to not accept promotions because of demanding family commitments. A [survey](http://www.thejournal.ie/gender-discrimination-promotions-819524-Mar2013/) by Microsoft found that 28% of the women interviewed said prioritizing home life was the most significant obstacle to promotion.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Women spend more than double the amount of time men spend on unpaid labour such as household chores. The societal expectation that women will spend more time on [unpaid domestic labour](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/the-scourge-of-the-female-time-crunch/470379/) than men is simply another form of gender discrimination.
1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Young girls are socialised to see themselves as caregivers and to hold family and housekeeping values. From very early years, young girls are prepared for their unpaid labour as adults, spending [40%](http://www.medicaldaily.com/chores-around-world-girls-spend-40-more-time-boys-cooking-cleaning-caring-400671) more time than their male counterparts on chores daily.
1.1.3.2.3.3. Pro: Women can be rated less competent solely because of their gender \([p. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/41/16474.full.pdf)\).
1.1.3.2.3.4. Pro: While men are often promoted on the [basis of their 'potential'](https://psmag.com/economics/men-are-judged-based-on-their-potential-women-are-judged-based-on-their-past-performance) women are less so, instead being promoted for good performance. This delays their moving up the corporate ladder compared to their male peers.
1.1.4. Pro: Gender imbalance in the workplace exists due to innate differences between men and women, rather than as a result of systemic barriers.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Research has found that men are more likely than women to engage in behaviors likely to facilitate professional advancement, such as [initiating negotiations](https://www.cityam.com/men-more-likely-than-women-negotiate-big-pay-rises-study/).
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Even when women do instigate negotiations, they are inclined to request [30% less](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/women-are-still-not-asking-for-pay-rises-here-s-why/) than their male colleagues would push for.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: This disparity is due to the influence of society - as well as biology - on dictating to women what they are [worth](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/women-are-still-not-asking-for-pay-rises-here-s-why/). Without a societal shift in attitudes, women will still be unlikely to push for the advancement they deserve.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Women are less likely to engage in [competitive behaviours](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/can-quotas-help-tackle-the-confidence-gender-gap/) when amongst team mates of mixed genders. This effect is seen in girls as young as 10 years old.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: The difference in the rates at which the different genders chose to compete was [erased](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/can-quotas-help-tackle-the-confidence-gender-gap/) when individuals were competing against only their own gender and when a quota was introduced. This suggests that women and girls see themselves as less likely to achieve \(and from an early age\) based on their gender, which implies a societal influence.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The lack of women in leadership roles can be attributed to women making different life choices to men.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Studies show that fewer women than men want to make the sacrifices and take on the stress involved in [top corporate positions](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-on-leadership-mother-bosses-20151004-story.html).
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: When workers were asked to imagine a promotion in their current organization, women anticipated more negative outcomes \(stress, burden of responsibility, time sacrifice\) than men \([p. 12356](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/40/12354.full.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: This may be due to hostile workplace culture rather than a lack of desire for promotion.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many workplaces used to having a mainly male staff do not provide adequate provision of [female bathrooms](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-07/the-lack-of-equal-bathroom-access-for-women-is-a-global-design-flaw) \(only on certain floors/fewer stalls etc\). This is likely to only become apparent when experienced by a female member of staff.
1.1.4.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Women can feel marginalised and excluded by male-dominated culture \(office culture of making [sexist jokes](https://yourstory.com/herstory/2019/02/sexism-at-work-10-subtle-ways-women-can-combat-sexism), company traditions of entertaining clients at [golf clubs](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/05/our-traditionally-male-company-has-an-annual-golf-trip-but-our-new-female-employees-dont-play.html) etc.\). Such a barrier to entry may be invisible until there is a female staff member present.
1.1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: This may be due to women having more domestic responsibilities on top of their paid employment than their male counterparts, rather than a lack of desire for promotion.
1.1.4.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1.
1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Women who refuse leadership roles generally do so as long hours and additional work loads may conflict with their desire for a healthy work-life balance \([p. 18](https://cclinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/whatwomenwant.final_.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.1.3. Con: Women often rule out such positions due to the inflexibility afforded them in the workplace \(flexible working hours, in-house childcare, etc.\) that would allow them to effectively manage their work-life alongside family commitments.
1.1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: 83% of PR workers found balancing work and childcare commitments [challenging](https://womeninpr.org.uk/the-gender-confidence-gap/). Given that 2/3 of women admit to taking the main responsibility for organising childcare, this is a statistic that disproportionately affects them.
1.1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: As women are more likely to take a larger share of childcare, they are often [indirectly](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/discrimination-because-of-sex-or-sexual-orientation/discrimination-because-of-sex/) excluded from positions where full-time hours are required.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Prospects for promotion often come at a time when women choose to have [families](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/18/quotas-women-boardroom-equality). With expensive childcare, and few meaningful family-friendly workplaces, few of those talented women last long enough to make it to the top.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.3.1.
1.1.4.3. Con: Evidence suggests women do desire opportunities for promotion to leadership roles, suggesting that the lack of gender parity in such positions is due to barriers in the workplace - such as a lack of development opportunities for women - rather than as a result of perceived innate differences.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: When hiring or promoting, selectors tend to choose [the candidate most like them](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers)(Furthermore, the human tendency to gravitate to people like oneself leads powerful men to sponsor and advocate for other men when leadership opportunities arise.), meaning that male-dominated companies often identify more with male behaviours, and candidates, and thus perpetuate male-dominated management structures.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: When gender-blind selection occurs, more female candidates are selected, but when gender is known to the selectors, they \(male or female\) are [biased against](http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/04/womens-inhumanity-to-women/) female candidates.
1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Quota-mandated exposure to female political representatives appears to have little effect on public gender bias \([p. 183](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9C64EDE9CA9C1B60C0428A57A823872C/S2052263018000088a.pdf/div-class-title-do-gender-quotas-really-reduce-bias-evidence-from-a-policy-experiment-in-southern-africa-div.pdf)\).
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: A study found that 74.1% of women were interested in moving up one or more levels in their organization \([p. 17](https://cclinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/whatwomenwant.final_.pdf)\).
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Firms afford fewer [development](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-men-and-women-see-the-workplace-differently/)(But women are less likely to get those promotions. They also receive fewer challenging “stretch” assignments, less training and fewer development opportunities than men.) opportunities to women in contrast to men, unfairly hindering their prospects for promotion and thus necessitating governmental intervention.
1.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.5. Pro: Many women in the business sphere may come from the same type of background in terms of race and class, and be similarly educated, which means they may not bring particularly diverse perspectives.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Only 3.2% of Fortune 500 company directors are women of colour \([pp. 379-380](http://www.directwomen.org/sites/default/files/assets/Rhode%20and%20Packel%20%281%29.pdf)\).
1.1.5.2. Pro: More than two thirds of Fortune 500 companies have no women of colour on their board \([pp. 379-380](http://www.directwomen.org/sites/default/files/assets/Rhode%20and%20Packel%20%281%29.pdf)\).
1.1.5.3. Con: While there may be limitations to the diversity provided by just having quotas for women, this will still ultimately lead to more diversity than boards made up entirely of men.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Those in top jobs are still primarily [privately educated](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/britains-top-jobs-still-in-hands-of-private-school-elite-study-finds).
1.1.5.5. Pro: Individuals in top [banking jobs](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/184390/upper-middle-class-families-likely-produce-bankers) are likely to be from upper-middle-class families.
1.1.5.6. Pro: Gender quotas will not fully represent women until they are [intersectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) \([p. 42](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275010466_Quotas_and_intersectionality_Ethnicity_and_gender_in_candidate_selection)(Increasingly, it is acknowledged \nthat gender equality is not fully realised when only the dominant group of women – in this case, \nwhite, highly educated, middle-class and heterosexual – are equal to their male counterparts)\).
1.1.6. Pro: Gender quotas can lead to a more hostile working environment.
1.1.6.1. Con: The presence of more women can help eradicate sexist attitudes in the workplace.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.1.1.2.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Gender quotas will encourage women to exhibit sexist attitudes towards other women, which is counter-productive.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: If women still end up holding a minority of board seats and managerial positions, they may feel the best approach is to try and get along with the men in these roles, and this may include belittling or demeaning other women.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: There is no reason that gender quotas need to lead to women exhibiting sexist attitudes themselves. Competition for positions already exists and these quotas would likely open more doors for women, rather than making them turn against one another.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: Women who hold right-wing authoritarian beliefs are likely to express neo-sexist and hostile attitudes toward other women if they believe in the existence of gender quotas within their organisation \([p. 2](https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/11850/Sletcher%2c%20Jessica%20APSY%20Dissertation%20Submission.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)\).
1.1.6.2.4. Pro: Quotas put women in competition with each other for a finite number of "[women's seats](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/2012/09/quotas-women-boards-all-pros-and-cons-one-place)". This undermines co-operation and unity.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Quotas for women will lead to backlash, as people will feel it makes the system unfair, and this will lead to a worse work environment.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Backlash is a concern with any major reform policy that may be controversial. This does not mean that the policy is not worth pursuing.
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: Quotas will detract from the accomplishments of women in positions of authority - preventing them from being respected or listened to - even when they may have occupied those positions as a result of merit alone.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: By giving women a more regular place and voice in the boardroom, their presence will become [normalised](https://wearethecity.com/can-the-anonymous-boardroom-help-women-into-leadership/) and they will no longer be seen as being merely a 'box ticker' or have their credentials called into question.
1.1.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: Seeing female role models in leadership positions normalises womens' successes, builds confidence, and encourages other women to put themselves forward for senior roles \([p. 93](https://www.thresholds.co.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/Girlfriends_in_High_Places.pdf)\).
1.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/datafreaks/2014/10/16/gender-quotas-in-hiring-drive-away-both-women-and-men/#1e5c3c312350) has found that gender quotas are unattractive to women because they negate the importance of merit, driving away top talent.
1.1.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: Placing women in managerial positions to satisfy quotas undermines their seniority and creates the stereotype that women are incapable of reaching them based on their own merit.
1.1.6.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Many women might feel ashamed occupying a position where it could be assumed they were there due to a physical characteristic rather than their ability, which is a possibility with any quota.
1.1.6.3.2.3. Pro: Women who benefit from Affirmative Action policies are [seen by other employees](https://www.jstor.org/stable/257055?seq=1) as less qualified and competent at their job than their male counterparts, and less legitimate in holding their role.
1.1.6.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.2.1.1.
1.1.6.3.2.4. Pro: Exposure to female leaders doesn’t reduce stereotyping but often reinforces it, as individuals are inclined to pay more attention to traits that confirm their preconceptions. This creates extreme perceptions of female leaders \([pp. 25, 30](https://www.catalyst.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Women_Take_Care_Men_Take_Charge_Stereotyping_of_U.S._Business_Leaders_Exposed.pdf)\).
1.1.6.3.2.4.1. Con: This effect will likely become nullified once the number of women in leadership roles is such that it becomes obvious that women have a range of individual leadership styles.
1.1.6.3.2.4.2. Pro: Women who demonstrate [assertiveness](http://www.catalyst.org/media/damned-or-doomed-catalyst-study-gender-stereotyping-work-uncovers-double-bind-dilemmas-women) in leadership roles are seen as competent but are disliked.
1.1.6.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Recent research demonstrated that employees, who had experiences of women in leadership roles, [rated](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/are-successful-women-really-less-likable-than-successful-men/273926/) them favourably. An increase in women occupying managerial roles will only help break the stereotype that male managers are better.
1.1.6.3.2.4.3. Pro: Senior managers who themselves report directly to female managers are more likely to hold [stereotyped](http://women.govt.nz/inspiring-action-for-gender-balance/women-take-care-men-take-charge-stereotyping-us-business-leaders) views of women, which suggests that exposure to women leaders is not enough to reverse the phenomenon.
1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: Simply placing additional women in management/board positions is [insufficient](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) to create meaningful change. Women have to be empowered to self-identify - and be seen by others in the business - as leaders in order for cultural shift to permeate a business and its employees.
1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: There is a deep cultural bias towards hiring men over women.
1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Women also hold such [biases](http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/04/womens-inhumanity-to-women/) against their female peers when they are involved in hiring practices.
1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1.2. Con: If the cultural bias is really as strong as this suggests, quotas will succeed in getting women into managerial positions but likely have little impact in terms of ensuring those women are respected and have real authority.
1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1.3. Pro: If given the choice between a male or female boss when taking a new job, Americans strongly lean towards men and prefer a male boss over a female boss by [35% to 23%](http://news.gallup.com/poll/165791/americans-prefer-male-boss.aspx).
1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.1.
1.1.6.3.2.5. Pro: Women in leadership roles are judged to a [higher standard](https://www.catalyst.org/2017/01/19/10-big-issues-women-face-at-work-and-what-leaders-can-do-to-help/) than men and are rewarded with less.
1.1.6.3.2.5.1. Con: This may improve over time if quotas are introduced, as more women will be in leadership positions and therefore there will be more opportunities for women to show they can be very good leaders.
1.1.6.3.2.5.2. Pro: It is a common belief that women have to work [twice as hard](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-julia-gillard-gender-equality-women-work-equal-pay-success-a9200791.html) and be twice as smart as their male counterparts in order to gain the same level of professional recognition.
1.1.6.3.2.5.3. Pro: Female leaders are [perceived](https://www.catalyst.org/2017/01/19/10-big-issues-women-face-at-work-and-what-leaders-can-do-to-help/) as “never just right". If female business leaders act in a way consistent with gender stereotypes, they are considered too soft. If they go against gender stereotypes, they are considered too tough.
1.1.6.3.2.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.4.2.
1.1.6.3.3. Con: Most workers in large companies have little to no interaction with or awareness of the processes for the [selection of boards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) and senior managers.
1.1.6.3.4. Pro: Given the current [sexism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/sexist-bias-boardroom-women) at board level, women promoted through a quota system would likely find themselves sidelined or targeted for abuse, thus reducing the coherence of the board.
1.1.6.3.5. Con: The current system is already unfair, which is why quotas are needed. Gender imbalance already leads to a tougher work environment for women.
1.1.6.3.5.1. Pro: Poor maternity leave, or a perception that women of child-bearing age may leave the company 'in the lurch' can impede women from being [selected](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/pregnancy-discrimination-recruitment-young-womens-trust/) for managerial positions, or from putting themselves forward for such positions in the first place.
1.1.6.3.5.1.1. Pro: It was revealed that a [third](https://recruitingtimes.org/recruitment-and-hr-legal-updates/23898/bosses-are-avoiding-hiring-women-of-childbearing-age/) of bosses in the UK avoided hiring women they thought might start a family.
1.1.6.3.5.1.2. Pro: Many women believe that they would be penalised at work if they were to request a more flexible work schedule to fit around family commitments \([p. 8](https://www.employment-studies.co.uk/system/files/resources/files/462.pdf)\).
1.1.6.3.5.1.3. Con: It is illegal to deny a woman employment or a promotion because she is [pregnant](https://maternityaction.org.uk/advice/pregnancy-discrimination/) or of child bearing age \([p. 40](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/your_rights_to_equality_at_work_-_applying_for_a_job.pdf)\).
1.1.6.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.1.1.2.
1.2. Pro: Women in senior positions can alter the culture of companies in order to support women in lower positions.
1.2.1. Con: Companies may deliberately select female board members and managers who are not likely to challenge the way in which the company works. As a result, they can comply with the quota and not have to accept any change.
1.2.1.1. Con: This could be true of any position and regardless of gender. It is not a problem particular to gender quotas.
1.2.1.2. Pro: [When hiring women to their board](http://boardmember.com/3-mistakes-companies-make-when-recruiting-women-as-board-members/), current boards will likely choose women who have an in with them \(e.g. the CEO's best friend's wife\), women with [familial ties](https://qz.com/223405/indias-effort-for-more-women-on-boards-is-backfiring-in-the-worst-way/) to the board, women who have or are currently serving on another board, or women with passive personalities.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: This allows companies to feign diversity while maintaining the "[boy's club](https://qz.com/india/223405/indias-effort-for-more-women-on-boards-is-backfiring-in-the-worst-way/)" of managerial positions.
1.2.2. Pro: Women in senior positions can use their status to raise the wages of those below them, decreasing the overall wage gap in their sector.
1.2.2.1. Con: The application of gender quotas in [Norway](http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/gender-quotas-dont-help-businesses-they-dont-even-help-women) had no demonstrable effect on reducing the gender pay gap, nor did it help provide an incentive for women to enter the business world.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The majority of medium and large companies pay [higher wage rates](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43129339) to men than to women.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: This is largely due to men being in [higher-paid positions](https://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap), rather than any disparity between men and women in the same role \(which would be illegal\).
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: For example, many airline companies have a substantial pay gap due to the gender make-up of the [pilot](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43129339) community \([p. 1](https://corporate.easyjet.com/~/media/Files/E/Easyjet/attachments/easyjet-gender-pay-gap-report-november-2017)\).
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Despite occupying almost half of all [full-time professional positions](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/howdothejobsmenandwomendoaffectthegenderpaygap/2017-10-06), women's hourly earnings are, on average, 11% lower than men's.
1.2.2.3. Con: Having women in executive roles only decreases the wage gap for workers in the [higher ranks](https://associationsnow.com/2019/08/study-women-executives-help-close-wage-gap-but-mostly-at-the-top/) of a corporation and does little to help those in entry positions.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: The pay gap between the highest and lowest earners has reached its highest point for [30 years](https://www.poverty.ac.uk/report-inequality-international-comparisons/income-gap-rising-within-and-between-countries).
1.2.3. Pro: The presence of women in management settings can expose previously overlooked barriers to entry and allow those to be tackled.
1.2.3.1. Con: [Researchers](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/ct-biz-0707-work-advice-huppke-20140707-column.html) found that the marriage structure shaped men's attitudes, beliefs and behaviors toward women in the workplace. Imposing gender quotas will not address these root causes of workplace sexism rendering them counter-productive.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Even in marriages where both partners work full time, [nearly a third](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/ct-biz-0707-work-advice-huppke-20140707-column.html) of men believe that sole responsibility for household income should fall to them. This belief may impact how a male manager hires or promotes women.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Hiring policies within companies are largely set by their boards and CEOs, the [majority](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/ct-biz-0707-work-advice-huppke-20140707-column.html) of which are male and tend to have 'stay-at-home' wives. Therefore, the underlying sexism responsible for the gender imbalance is unlikely to be altered by quotas.
1.2.3.1.3. Con: Using quotas to help place qualified women in boardroom positions will help normalise their presence there, thus undermining the stereotyped belief that only men hold positions of authority in both the home and workplace.
1.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.5.1.
1.2.3.4. Con: Many places already have [gender equality laws](https://www.legislationline.org/topics/topic/7) and policies to deal with barriers to entry for corporate women.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: The [Nordic countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries), where gender quotas are common, are generally considered to have the most effective gender equality laws and [rank highest](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/gender-gap-equality-women-parity-countries/) for gender parity globally.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: These laws are often [insufficient](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/gender-equality-in-the-workplace-we-are-not-there-yet), especially in targeting barriers that are harder to pinpoint, such as bias and exclusionary behaviour, or attitudes within a company's upper echelons.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: Equal opportunity legislation is difficult to [enforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity#Difficulties_with_implementation). It is very difficult to [prove](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/discrimination-at-work/checking-if-its-discrimination/if-you-think-youve-been-unfairly-treated-when-applying-for-a-job/)(It’s difficult to prove discrimination in recruitment because the employer can give many reasons for not offering you the job.) that a panel of selectors chose a male candidate over a female candidate due to bias, rather than because they were placing more value on certain experience or qualifications.
1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Gender equality is one of the [major goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/) of the [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations).
1.2.3.4.4. Con: The US - often acknowledged as a global leader - is ranked as the [15th worst](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/10-worst-countries-for-gender-equality-ranked-by-perception) country for gender equality.
1.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4. Con: Evidence suggests that quotas at the top level do not help [women](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-boden-quotas-women-corporate-boards-unconstitutional-20190708-story.html) at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.
1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.1.1.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Norway has had gender quotas for boards for ten years and has found that a key shortcoming of the quotas has been that there has been [no effect or benefit](https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/13/evidence-from-norway-shows-gender-quotas-dont-work-for-women/)(the most puzzling information revealed by the data is that the quota mandate “had no discernible beneficial effect on women at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.”) for women at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Women in positions of power often see women underneath them in the corporate hierarchy as a [threat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2016/01/13/the-dark-side-of-female-rivalry-in-the-workplace-and-what-to-do-about-it/#1415e4fb5255) and so have little incentive to support them.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Women in senior roles can often be seen as [bullies](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/the-queen-bee-in-the-corner-office/534213/) by women who are their juniors.
1.2.5. Pro: Having more women in managerial positions will help break the stereotype that women cannot be good leaders.
1.2.5.1. Pro: More women in leadership positions means that other women have visible role models and mentors to help them climb the corporate ladder \([pp. 5-7](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-in-Leadership-Why-It-Matters.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Cross-gender mentoring relationships face many challenges from a female point of view, as women are more likely than men to find themselves with a mentor of the opposite sex \([p. 205](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: The pressure to perform may deter women from taking on a protégé whose failure would reflect negatively on them as a mentor. Given that the female mentor-female protégé relationship is the most visible - and risky - of all mentoring combinations, women may prefer male mentees over female ones \([p. 204](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The lack of women in the upper tiers of corporate structures also contributes to those in such positions [feeling isolated](https://www.egonzehnder.com/what-we-do/diversity-inclusion/insights/its-lonely-at-the-top) as the only woman \(or one of very few women\) on their level.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In the status quo, the small number of women on boards have to compete for limited acknowledgement. Increasing their number may also increase competition among those women and only increase feelings of isolation.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Research](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) has shown that when women are isolated in the upper structures of a company they are more likely to display risk-averse behaviour which can deny the company of more innovative contributions to the workplace.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Women are often hesitant to initiate a cross-gender mentoring relationship due to the fear of it being misconstrued as a sexual advance by the mentor or others: an issue not faced by individuals \(when it is assumed they are heterosexual\) in same-gender pairings \([p. 205](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: Those in cross-gender mentoring relationships assume more gender-stereotypical roles, which contributes to an unlevel playing field for women and hinders opportunity for advancement \([p. 206](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.2.5.1.1.4. Pro: There is a lack of role-modelling in cross-gender mentor partnerships \([p. 205](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVXOcQ3OLQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: When young women see themselves represented in positions of power, they are more likely to apply to these positions in the first place.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.1.1.
1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: If women believe that gender-related barriers to success exist in their chosen occupation, then they may be especially inspired by a female role model who suggests that similar success may be possible for other women in spite of these barriers \([p. 3](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/services/docs/same-gender-role-models.pdf)\).
1.2.5.1.3. Con: Mentorship programmes are often [ineffective and ill thought-out](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/corporate-mentorship-programs/528927/) within companies. It is unlikely that increasing women's access to such programmes would have a large effect on their career progression.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Before implementing gender quotas, the average number of board positions held by women in Norway was four. Following quota implementation, this figure rose to around nine \([p. 103](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1007&context=njilb)\). It is unlikely that such women will have the time needed to be an effective mentor to women in all of these companies along with their other responsibilities.
1.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.4.
1.2.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.5.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Deeply entrenched cultural beliefs dictate that women are to be seen as less qualified or less [natural](https://theconversation.com/spot-the-difference-how-unconscious-gender-bias-leads-to-missed-opportunities-6459) in leadership roles.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: Women are viewed as better overall [leaders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikaandersen/2012/03/26/the-results-are-in-women-are-better-leaders/#46e58da6e038) than their male counterparts.
1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro: Former US President, Barack Obama, said that he thought that women were [indisputably](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50805822) better leaders than men.
1.2.5.4.1.2. Pro: In 2020, Pope Francis increased the number of women in [decision making roles](https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/13597/pope-says-women-leaders-better-than-men) in the Vatican as he believed them to be “much better administrators than men”.
1.2.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1.3.
1.3. Con: Gender quotas that do not drive selection of candidates based on [competency](https://theconversation.com/diversity-quotas-will-only-lead-to-token-appointments-doing-more-harm-than-good-132244) or accomplishment are unjust.
1.3.1. Pro: It is unfair that men who may be better qualified for these positions will miss out due to a requirement that a certain number of board seats or managerial positions be given to women.
1.3.1.1. Pro: There may well be businesses where no discrimination is occurring but the government introducing quotas forces them to make changes to their board or managerial structure due to the implementation of quotas, which is unfair.
1.3.1.2. Con: However, it is also unfair that women may miss out on roles they are qualified for due to gender bias, whether conscious or subconscious. This is the issue that gender quotas seek to fix.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Men who have worked very hard to earn their positions should not then lose them, or miss out on promotions, simply because the government determines that some positions must go to women regardless of experience.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Gender quotas [may force highly skilled workers to leave](https://environmental-conscience.com/gender-quotas-pros-cons/) the country, in search of better pay and respect. This may be particularly harmful for minority men \([p. 16](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/7875/Quotas%20for%20Men%20final%20for%20publication.pdf;sequence=9)(A quota is not sufficient, in itself, to guarantee a genuine meritocracy; weaker men might still triumph over more talented male rivals due to other anti-competitive aspects of the selection process such as patronage. There is also a risk that minority men might be forced out of politics to preserve places for majority men; such a move would run counter to the goals of the quota. Hence, an emphasis on merit is essential to avoid the replacement of one form of elite with another.)\).
1.3.2. Con: Women are not currently given equal opportunities based on merit in the work place.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Women make up a [similar proportion](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/05/why-women-are-locked-out-of-top-jobs-despite-having-high-ambition.html) of the entry-level workforce as men, but struggle - comparatively - to rise through the ranks, despite having the desire to. This indicates a gender-bias when hiring for boardroom positions.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: There are [strategies](https://ideal.com/diversity-hiring/) - such as blind hiring, the 'two in the pool' effect, and careful wording of job descriptions - which can help mitigate this sort of bias in hiring practices, without the need for gender quotas.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.
1.3.2.2. Con: The fact that women do not currently receive equal opportunities does not necessarily mean quotas are the answer. Rather, it might be necessary to provide a higher standard of training and education on gender bias and how to avoid it in the workplace.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Current online courses designed to address unconscious gender bias in the workplace have a [limited effect](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01301-8)(Katerina Bezrukova, a psychologist at the University of Buffalo in New York who studies the efficacy of such training, says that stand-alone diversity training might have little effect on employees’ attitudes or behaviours around bias.), suggesting that improved training is needed.
1.3.2.3. Con: An individual can take [legal action](https://www.eoc.org.uk/equal-opportunities-policy/) if they feel they have not been given equal opportunities by an employer.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Many women suffer gender discrimination in their work lives. However, many women are unable - or unwilling - to pinpoint these experiences, a phenomenon known as '[second-generation gender bias](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers)(Second-generation bias is embedded in stereotypes and organizational practices that can be hard to detect, but when people are made aware of it, they see possibilities for change.)'.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Sexist assumptions mean that the merit of female candidates is not acknowledged appropriately in the status quo.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.4.1.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Research has shown that the high quality work of female employees is [more likely](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gender-bias-at-work-turns-up-in-feedback-1443600759?alg=y)(Specifically, managers are significantly more likely to critique female employees for coming on too strong, and their accomplishments are more likely than men’s to be seen as the result of team, rather than individual efforts) \(than the work of male employees\) to be attributed to 'good team effort' rather than to the work of the woman herself.
1.3.2.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.3.4.
1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.3.4. Pro: Forgoing the most competent candidate for a less competent candidate of the prescribed gender harms productivity and, in turn, society.
1.3.4.1. Con: The best candidate for the benefit of society may not be the best candidate for a company's interests. Societal value differs from corporate financial gain in that one must also account for such impacts as representation, quality of life, and equality.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Productivity of a nation is [strongly correlated](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/blog/well-being-and-gdp.htm) with its citizens' well-being.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Countries with higher GDP also have a higher [Better Life Index](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/blog/well-being-and-gdp.htm).
1.3.5. Con: Quotas increase the likelihood of finding qualified candidates by forcibly increasing the resource pool.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The implemention of quotas in Norway pushed boards to search more creatively and [expansively](https://www.gendereconomy.org/the-debate-about-quotas/) for board members, dramatically increasing the candidate pool.
1.4. Con: Governments should not intervene in company HR practices without serious cause to do so.
1.4.1. Pro: One of the primary objectives of any business is to make money. Mandating businesses to promote their employees based on gender, rather than ability to help turn over profits, may hinder their financial growth.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Gender quotas have been responsible for driving away top talent which businesses are in need of to maximise financial growth.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.2.
1.4.1.2. Con: Having women in senior positions improves a company's [financial performance](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/J6az76rHkCE8jkJm0VYUnJ/Why-companies-should-recruit-more-women.html).
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Gender-diverse companies are [15%](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) more likely to have better financial returns above their respective national industry medians.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: [Alibaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group) co-founder, Jack Ma, stated that he valued more “[feminine](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/308021?)” virtues - such as high EQ - and so hires more women who demonstrate them. This suggests that financial improvements accompanying women in senior positions are better explained by company culture.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Male dominated boards have cost the global economy an estimated [$655 billion.](http://time.com/4053907/female-board-members/)
1.4.1.2.4. Con: Studies that look at performance before and after quotas are introduced [have not shown](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/will-gender-diversity-boards-really-boost-company-performance/) conclusive results linking performance improvement to the presence of gender balance in managerial positions.
1.4.1.2.5. Con: Gender quotas can negatively affect the [value](https://www.barrons.com/articles/are-gender-quotas-for-corporate-boards-bad-for-stocks-51552101808) of firms.
1.4.1.2.6. Pro: Companies with more women in senior executive roles demonstrate boosted [profits](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/08/female-executives-global-study-gender-diversity-workplace).
1.4.1.2.6.1. Con: If there were truly a correlation between higher percentages of women in senior leadership roles and companies' financial performances, they would be there in greater numbers.
1.4.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: A survey of Danish companies suggests that positive correlations between female board membership and company performance can largely be attributed to other factors, such as the woman's level of education, or familial ties to the company \([p. 22](http://ftp.iza.org/dp1708.pdf)(Furthermore, the results show that the positive performance effects are mainly related to female managers with a university degree while female CEOs who do not hold a university degree have a much smaller or insignificant effect on firm performance. Next, female members of boards of directors elected by the staff seem to have positive effects on firm performance. However, this positive effect does not carry over to other female board members, where the effect is negative - a result, which may be explained by the fact that a significant part of the women on boards have family ties to the owners.)\).
1.4.1.2.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.1.2.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.
1.4.1.2.6.2. Con: Empirical evidence surrounding the impact of gender diversity on firm performance is mixed \([p. 6](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)\).
1.4.1.2.6.3. Pro: [Fortune 500](https://www.catalyst.org/research/the-bottom-line-connecting-corporate-performance-and-gender-diversity/) companies with the highest percentage of women board directors outperformed those with the least by 53%.
1.4.2. Pro: The government mandating hiring practices violates the private property rights of the shareholders to decide who to place in [senior positions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/what-rights-do-all-common-shareholders-have.asp) and for what reasons.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Gender quotas could infringe on the freedom to conduct a business and the right to property: Articles 16 and 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights \([p. 55](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40804-017-0095-x.pdf)\).
1.4.2.2. Con: Governments and courts can intervene when any decision could be considered to be not in a [company's best interest](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2018/02/judicial-intervention-directors-decision-making-process-section-172). It could easily be argued that refusing to recognise the need for gender diversity in hiring practices is indeed not in a company's best interest.
1.4.3. Con: Discrimination is a serious cause and is so imbedded in business practice that it needs regulation to assist in changing things.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The UK government's Equal Opportunities Act clearly mandates for all employees to have fair opportunities to develop their abilities and to make full use of their potential \([p. 1](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362510/Equal_Opportunities_Policy_Statement_GOVUK.pdf)\).
1.4.3.2. Con: Specific instances of discrimination within businesses should be handled on a case-by-case basis, rather than through a blanket policy.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: It will not always be easy to identify or prove that discrimination is taking place when there are no or few women in managerial positions. For this reason, it is better to implement a blanket policy that requires some level of gender parity.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: Men are [less likely](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/02/unconscious-bias-most-women-believe-sexism-still-exists-but-most-men-disagree) than women to acknowledge the existence of sexism and gender bias.
1.4.3.3. Pro: In the US, there is a growing recognition that [market forces](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-board-directors-really-think-of-gender-quotas) will not correct the lack of gender diversity in leadership roles. If the government doesn’t intervene then there is no guarantee that this problem will ever be resolved.
1.4.3.4. Pro: The government has always passed laws in order to protect people from discrimination. Protecting women from discrimination in the workplace should be treated no differently.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: The [Civil Rights Act](https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm) in the US was enacted to protect people primarily from discrimination based on race and colour. Gender quotas will similarly protect women from being discriminated based on their gender in the workplace.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Half of the world's nations have implemented some form of national legislation in order to ensure a reasonable representation of [women in politics](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas).
1.5. Pro: Quotas at the top level help address the gender imbalance in the workplace.
1.5.1. Pro: There is a direct correlation between women in senior roles and [positive gender representation](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/women-leaders-key-to-workplace-equality/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5177&zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick) across a company at all levels.
1.5.1.1. Pro: As they may have faced discrimination themselves, women are more likely than men to be [aware](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/how-do-female-leaders-hire-trends-challenges/) of diversity and inclusion requirements.
1.5.2. Con: Quotas that accommodate women specifically often [exclude](https://www.gendereconomy.org/working-beyond-the-gender-binary/)(Companies are taking bold actions to address gendered gaps in wages and workplace promotions like boardroom gender quotas and targeted recruiting. However, current efforts focus almost exclusively on the challenges cisgender \(meaning, individuals who identify with the biological sex assigned at birth\) women face.) transgender and non-binary individuals.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Quotas which include transwomen and non-binary individuals often face backlash.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: In 2018, around 300 members of the UK's [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(UK\)) resigned over the [inclusion of transwomen](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43962349) on all-women shortlists.
1.5.2.2. Con: This is an argument for expanding who these quotas include, rather than against the idea of quotas in these instances.
1.5.3. Con: There are preferable alternatives to the legislated quota system that can still help achieve gender equality in the workplace.
1.5.3.1. Pro: One option is to introduce [targets](http://www.computerweekly.com/blog/WITsend/Is-there-an-alternative-to-female-quotas-for-management-boards), to highlight the lack of diversity at board level and encourage organisations to boost gender equality.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Introducing diversity targets may encourage businesses to train more women for these positions from early in their careers. This would ultimately allow more women to step into positions they are qualified for, rather than just using them to fill a strict quota.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: The option of gender targets has been used as an alternative to quotas in a number of [places](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ontario-wants-at-least-40-per-cent-women-on-provincial-boards-by2019/article30327193/).
1.5.3.1.3. Con: Using targets as opposed to quotas allows for the application of [unconscious bias](https://uk.work180.co/blog/gender-diversity-quotas-vs-targets).
1.5.3.1.4. Con: Targets are set internally by companies \(rather than being mandated by an external body\) and so are often seen as '[nice to have](https://www.institutelm.com/resourceLibrary/quotas-v-targets-what-s-the-best-way-to-promote-diversity.html)', rather than necessary.
1.5.3.2. Pro: A "[comply or explain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comply_or_explain)" governance system - which requires companies to address corporate guidelines set out by government regulators on crucial issues or else explain the reason for their failure to do so - could be used to encourage gender inclusivity in the boardroom.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The UK Corporate Governance Code contains a mandatory "comply or explain" clause which allows corporate boards to implement their own gender diversity policies but also explicitly requires merit to be a consideration in candidate selection \([p. 12](https://www.frc.org.uk/getattachment/e322c20a-1181-4ac8-a3d3-1fcfbcea7914/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code-\(September-2012\).pdf)\).
1.5.3.2.2. Con: "Comply or explain" systems are sometimes criticised as being [perfunctory](https://boardagenda.com/2017/07/21/comply-or-explain-uk-corporate-governance/) due to their voluntary nature.
1.5.3.3. Con: The fact that - despite being shown to boost [financial performance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2020/01/15/diversity-confirmed-to-boost-innovation-and-financial-results/#397cb84fc4a6) - women are still grossly [underrepresented](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-mather/dear-white-men-seven-piec_b_7899084.html) in leadership roles suggests that legislated quotas may be the only way to incentivize businesses to ensure gender parity in the workplace.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: There are only [22 women](https://www.cio.com/article/3302376/women-still-underrepresented-in-fortune-500-leadership-roles.html) CEOs in the Fortune 500 index.
1.5.3.3.2. Pro: The use of targets has only increased women's presence in FTSE 100 boardrooms to 29%. Using quotas instead would increase this figure as well as prevent [backsliding](https://www.legalcheek.com/lc-careers-posts/why-quotas-are-the-only-solution-to-gender-equality-in-the-workplace/).
1.5.3.4. Pro: In 2010, the UK government introduced positive action provisions for employers in order to help address underrepresentation in the workplace \([p. 3](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85046/positive-action-recruitment.pdf)\), with companies who fail to promote a fairer deal for women liable to be "[named and shamed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8177872/Britain-embraces-positive-action-to-abolish-workplace-discrimination.html)".
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: [Reputation](https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/advice/why-reputation-management-is-so-important-in-a-business/) is important for any business to thrive. The potential to be exposed for failure to address the gender disparity in leadership roles puts pressure on businesses to not unfairly [disadvantage women](https://simply-sustainable.co.uk/insights/why-companies-need-to-act-now-to-protect-their-reputation-with-the-equal-equality-act-2010-gender-pay-gap-information-regulations-2016) without the need for gender quotas.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: When faced with male and female candidates of equal merit \([p. 4](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85046/positive-action-recruitment.pdf)\), positive action provisions give employers the option to choose the female candidate in order to address underrepresentation of women in the workforce.
1.5.4. Pro: The current work environment means that without quotas women often do not get selected for these roles, even if they are qualified.
1.5.4.1. Con: It is easy for quotas to be fulfilled by having the same set of qualified women, referred to as [golden skirts](http://sciencenordic.com/golden-skirts-fill-board-rooms), hold multiple board positions. This impedes the diversity intended by the introduction of quotas and undermines the women's ability to create meaningful change.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: The presence of 'golden skirts' on company boards reduces the chance of other women getting to the boardroom, as the pool of choice for large companies remains very narrow \([pp. 9-10](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=joseph_wharton_scholars)\).
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Being spread thin on multiple boards suggests that those women would not have the time or resources to influence and mentor up-and-coming women managers or potential board members \([p. 10](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=joseph_wharton_scholars)\).
1.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.3.1.
1.5.4.1.3. Con: In Norway, where a quota system was introduced in 2006, female board members are more likely to have a [college-level education](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/for-gender-parity-on-boards-look-to-norway/article24757691/)(In Norway, one study found that 36 per cent of female board members had six years or more of university education, while only 22 per cent of male board members did.) than male board members, yet male board members remain [twice as likely](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/for-gender-parity-on-boards-look-to-norway/article24757691/)(Again, it didn't happen. If anything, as The Economist pointed out, "Norway still has more 'golden trousers' – male directors are twice as likely to sit on more than one board.") to be on more than one board of directors than their female counterparts.
1.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: Similarly, female board members are more likely to hold relevant professional degrees or qualifications than their male predecessors \([p. 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/8/3205/pdf)\).
1.5.4.1.4. Con: [Over-boarding](https://evenlodeinvestment.com/news/the-risks-of-overboarding) is not a challenge applicable to only female board members. As such, it would be unfair to [link](https://insights.diligent.com/board-diversity/women-corporate-directors-overboarded-or-overlooked) this problem to the introduction of gender quotas.
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.2.4.3.1.1.
1.5.4.3. Con: It is already illegal in most first-world countries to discriminate based on gender.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: In the US it is illegal to discriminate in the workplace based on a person's [gender or sex](https://www.workplacefairness.org/sexual-gender-discrimination).
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: UK individuals have the right not to be discriminated against at [work](https://www.unison.org.uk/get-help/knowledge/discrimination/gender-discrimination/) because of their gender.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: Whilst illegal, companies can circumvent the law by citing other 'legitimate' reasons in order to prevent womens' selection for more senior roles.
1.5.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.2.1.
1.5.4.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.3.2.
1.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.5.2.
1.5.5. Con: Corporate gender quotas have produced only marginal changes in the countries that have adopted them.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.4.1.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Gender quotas in Norway did not produce significant results.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: The implementation of gender quotas in Norway was shown to [drastically alter](https://www.gendereconomy.org/the-debate-about-quotas/)(While directors in the Norwegian companies had initially strongly opposed quotas, once quotas were imposed by the government, the directors eventually changed their minds. According to these directors, their fears were unfounded, and, after a period of transition, they felt that the increased representation of women on boards actually improved overall governance and decision making.) the attitudes of company directors.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Pro: Directors of Norwegian companies admitted, after at first being skeptical, that increased representation of women on boards [improved](https://www.gendereconomy.org/the-debate-about-quotas/) overall governance and decision making.
1.5.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.1.3.
1.5.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.
1.5.5.3. Pro: The [highest](http://time.com/2861431/female-executives-gender-quotas/) proportions of women with senior roles in corporations are in territories that have not enacted any compulsory quotas.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: Spain, Germany, and Switzerland had some of the lowest proportions of women in [senior management and executive](https://mic.com/articles/84601/the-countries-with-the-highest-number-of-female-executives-are-not-the-ones-you-d-expect#.AsQ1BJ3qX) roles in the world, despite domestic policies designed to address the issue.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: [Russia](https://time.com/2861431/female-executives-gender-quotas/) has the highest proportion of women in senior management globally \(43%\) without any type of gender programming.
1.5.5.3.3. Pro: Between 2012 and 2013, [China](https://time.com/2861431/female-executives-gender-quotas/) doubled the number of senior management roles held by women from 25% to 51%.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Only [3%](https://time.com/2861431/female-executives-gender-quotas/) of 145 Nordic large-cap companies have a female chief executive.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: In Norway, even though 40.5% of board positions are occupied by women, less than 1% of CEOs are women \([p. 21](http://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1709500/2-KateStary-CorporateGovernanceandDirectorsDutiesPaper2.pdf)\). This indicates that women's contributions on boards are not valued such that they advance to CEO.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.6. Pro: Gender diversity at the top level of a company is an asset to businesses.
1.6.1. Con: Evidence suggests that there is no tangible link between gender quotas and boardroom performance.
1.6.1.1. Con: Even if the link between gender quotas and boardroom performance is not direct, there are many [benefits](https://www.boardeffect.com/blog/importance-diversity-boards/) to having diversity on company boards. These would naturally appear as a byproduct of any quotas that were implemented.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Analysis of a global survey of 21,980 firms from 91 countries found no impact of board gender quotas on firm performance \([pp. 3, 7](https://piie.com/publications/wp/wp16-3.pdf)\).
1.6.1.3. Pro: Positive outcomes of increased gender diversity in the boardrooms are likely due to the presence of a [third variable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2016/06/23/the-truth-about-womens-impact-on-corporate-boards-its-not-good-news/#57270f8e5ecb) \(i.e. suggesting that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation in this instance\).
1.6.2. Con: The application of gender quotas in [Norway](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41337208?seq=1) led to younger and less experienced boards, and a deterioration in operating performance.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The use of quite high quotas in the case of Norway may have resulted in there being a shortage of qualified women, meaning companies had to put younger, less experienced women on boards simply to comply with the law change.
1.6.2.2. Con: This is a transient problem that could be resolved over time by giving women the opportunities and training necessary for them to become qualified board members.
1.6.2.3. Con: There are [benefits](https://www.legal-island.com/articles/uk/features/hr/2018/july/age-diversity-the-new-gender-diversity/) to having a diverse range of ages in the boardroom.
1.6.3. Pro: Having women in senior positions allows them to bring a unique perspective.
1.6.3.1. Con: It is better to have a group of like-minded individuals with natural similarities and common interests - rather than to focus purely on diversity - as they will work better as a team and be able to communicate more effectively.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: A shared culture within the workplace creates passion [amongst employees](https://www.interact-intranet.com/blog/perfect-fit-company-culture/) and develops teamwork, cooperation, and trust between them.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: Having like-minded employees in a company increases [retention rates](https://www.interact-intranet.com/blog/perfect-fit-company-culture/).
1.6.3.1.3. Con: Companies that have experimented with diversifying by attracting more female employees have found that their output and employee [quality was not harmed](https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-rising-the-unseen-barriers) by increasing the diversity on their team of workers.
1.6.3.2. Con: Diversity in gender does not necessarily mean diversity in perspectives.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Analysis demonstrates that men and women are more alike in their [inclinations, attitudes, and skills](https://hbr.org/2018/05/what-most-people-get-wrong-about-men-and-women)(There is wide variation among women and among men, and meta-analyses show that, on average, the sexes are far more similar in their inclinations, attitudes, and skills than popular opinion would have us believe.) than is widely believed.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: Equal representation is more likely to lead to diversity in perspectives than the massively unequal representation currently experienced.
1.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: Managers and board members have been [unable to see value](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/lack-diversity-business-leaders-limit-innovation) in ideas that do not relate to them, an issue that costs their businesses given boards are dominated by white men, meaning they are often out of touch with ideas that serve female and non-white consumers.
1.6.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Apple famously failed to include a period tracker in its [Healthkit](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844021/apple-promised-an-expansive-health-app-so-why-cant-i-track) product. This was a feature at least half the population would consider obvious but the [male majority](https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5949453/no-surprise-apple-is-very-white-very-male) team overlooked.
1.6.3.3. Pro: [75%](https://thersagroup.com/rsa_views/glass-ceiling-addressing-the-boardroom-gender-gap/) of managers rate women higher than men for intuition and empathy.
1.6.3.4. Pro: When surveyed, nearly [two-thirds](https://thersagroup.com/glass-ceiling-addressing-the-boardroom-gender-gap/) \(62%\) of managers remarked that women contribute differently in the boardroom as compared to their male colleagues and possess a unique, valuable skillset.
1.6.4. Pro: Greater gender balance on company boards alters decision making processes \([p. 16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1057/emr.2009.27)\).
1.6.4.1. Pro: Women directors with different values are likely to question conventional ideas and to speak up in doubt over a particular managerial issue or decision \([p. 18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1057/emr.2009.27)\).
1.6.4.2. Pro: Women directors’ contributions to board decision-making was found to enhance strategic involvement amongst board members \([p. 25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1057/emr.2009.27)\).
1.6.4.3. Con: The impact of women members on boardroom decision-making depends more on their prior professional experience and values than on their gender \([pp. 22, 25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1057/emr.2009.27)\).
1.6.5. Pro: Gender imbalances result in ineffective product design.
