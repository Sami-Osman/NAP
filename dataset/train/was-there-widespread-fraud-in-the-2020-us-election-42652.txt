Discussion Name: Was there widespread fraud in the 2020 US Election?

1. There was widespread fraud in the 2020 US Election.
1.1. Pro: The widespread use of mail-in ballots led to voter fraud.
1.1.1. Pro: Many ballots that were improperly filled out ended up being counted.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Some Pennsylvania counties did not [notify](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/) voters when their ballots needed to be fixed, or 'cured'.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Democrats were [more likely](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kayleigh-mcenany-ronna-mcdaniel-press-conference-transcript-lawsuits-over-election-disputes) to be given a chance to fix their ballots than Republicans.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While it is true that Democrats were more likely to get a chance to cure their ballots, it was not done on specifically partisan lines. All counties received the same [legal guidance.](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/)
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Democrats were more likely to vote by mail, and so made up a [disproportionate](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/) number of votes to be cured.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: [Democratic counties](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pennsylvania-mail-ballots-republican-legal-challenge-naked-ballots-fixed-cured/) gave their voters a chance to cure their ballots, while many Republican counties did not.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: This occurred because counties simply [chose](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/) not to contact voters. This included both Republican and Democratic leaning counties.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Absentee voters are not allowed to cure their ballots after Election Day in [Pennsylvania](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/giuliani-presses-trump-election-challenge-case-in-fiery-news-conference).
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This was admitted and was the only Trump lawsuit that was accepted. However, the votes that were cancelled [did little to reverse Biden's lead in the state](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/13/trump-legal-team-cases-dropped-436492).
1.1.1.2. Con: Vote '[curing](https://apnews.com/article/ap-explains-cured-ballot-018369d11ec349472e95ee5b4053df27)' is a normal process which occurs across many states in every election.
1.1.1.3. Con: The amount of votes that are at issue are not enough to overcome the [lead](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/) Joe Biden has.
1.1.2. Pro: Mail-in ballots were manipulated before being sent in.
1.1.2.1. Pro: A man in Arizona has been [convicted or trying to vote twice](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?combine=&state=All&year=&case_type=All&fraud_type=24489&page=0), using absentee voting.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Irrelevant because it is not possible to successfully vote twice because each ballot has a unique identifying code. The fact that someone attempted to vote twice is not evidence of fraud. It is only evidence of attempted fraud.
1.1.2.2. Con: It is nearly impossible to make fake ballots.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The card ballots are printed on are [highly specific and hard to reproduce](https://theconversation.com/6-ways-mail-in-ballots-are-protected-from-fraud-145666).
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Committing widescale voter fraud would require [an incredible amount of information](https://www.cnet.com/news/mail-in-voting-fraud-is-nearly-impossible-to-commit/) that no individual or even political association has.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: With significant resources, the difficulties in making fake ballots could be overcome.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: The mere possibility of doing so is not evidence that anyone with the requisite resources actually produced any fake ballots, let alone on a large enough scale to impact the election results.
1.1.2.3. Pro: There was an attempt to deliver a truck full of [fake ballots](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/11/07/report-armed-qanon-supporter-drove-to-philadelphia-to-deliver-truck-full-of-fake-votes/) to the Philadelphia count centre.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: These ballots were brought by Trump supporters, and so any fraud that would have occurred would have been against Joe Biden, rather than for him as is the overall claim.
1.1.3. Pro: Votes in the 2020 election were counted after election day.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Ballots that arrive [after](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-mail-ballots-counted-deadline-supreme-court-20201111.html) election day are being counted in some states.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Ballots that arrive after election day [are being counted](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/30/fact-check-some-mail-ballots-arriving-post-election-day-count/6075311002/), but only if they are postmarked from before election day, and arrive before a given time.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Whistle-blower and US Postal Service worker [Richard Hopkins](https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-us-postal-service-worker-goes-public-alleges-voter-fraud) claimed that his supervisor was discussing tampering with ballots and backdating them in order to make them valid.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Hopkins later [recanted](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/11/11/erie-postal-worker-richard-hopkins-admits-making-up-pennsylvania-election-ballot-tampering-claims/) his allegations.
1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The question of whether Hopkins has recanted his allegations or not is unclear, as other sources [claim](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/nov/10/richard-hopkins-pennsylvania-postal-worker-recants/) that he has denied ever recanting his original statement.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: A right wing activist group, [Project Veritas](https://www.businessinsider.com/video-shows-usps-whistleblower-not-alone-when-making-affidavit-2020-11?r=US&IR=T), wrote the affidavit that Hopkins signed, and two men were present when the affidavit was sworn.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Project Veritas has a long, well-known history of using blatantly deceitful methods to advance its political agenda.
1.1.3.1.2.3. Con: The Erie [postmaster](https://eu.goerie.com/story/news/2020/11/09/erie-postmaster-calls-claims-mishandled-ballots-100-false/6221116002/) has denied the allegations fully.
1.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: The FBI have failed to protect Hopkins as a whistle-blower, and so he has faced [intimidation and harassment](https://nypost.com/2020/11/11/fbis-failures-to-protect-whistleblowers-then-and-now-devine/). This would not have happened had he been lying, and his claims would have been dismissed.
1.1.3.1.2.4.1. Con: The fact that he has not received whistle-blower protection indicates that his claims are baseless.
1.1.3.2. Con: Votes are regularly [counted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/02/votes-counted-after-election-day/) after election day, and so this is not evidence of fraud.
1.1.4. Con: It is unclear why Democrats would rig the ballots in favor of their presidential candidate, yet allow Republicans to win seats in the House and potentially maintain control over the Senate.
1.1.4.1. Con: If the Democrats were indeed committing voter fraud, then a win in every conceivable race would make this very obvious, and so winning only the presidential makes the most sense.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: The Democrats were [expected to win in a landslide](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-blowout-october-surprise). Therefore, it would not have been suspicious if they had won far more seats.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: They invested heavily in [down-ballot races to unseat prominent Republicans](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/republicans-fight-hold-control-senate-democrats-try-capitalize-anti-trump-n1245847). Winning at least a few of them would not have been suspicious.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Trump won by such a large margin that it would have been obvious if a Democratic landslide happens, as [Sidney Powell has said](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article247313859.html).
1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: There is [no evidence of this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwivwuaBypbtAhXR66QKHWSZAxkQFjAAegQIAhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2020%2F11%2F19%2Ffact-checking-craziest-news-conference-trump-presidency%2F&usg=AOvVaw1HBiqQq6DYMvy90dQQsxeD). It is simply being repeated by the Trump campaign.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Given how much attention alleged voter fraud in one presidential race is garnering, this would be multiplied for every additional race.
1.1.4.1.3. Con: The Democrats would not need to win every race for an attempt at fraud to be successful.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: All they would need to do is win the swing states they did as well as a few down-ballot races which were already close.
1.1.4.2. Pro: It is unlikely that, if Democrats had the ability to commit widespread voter fraud, why they would not also commit this in favour of their candidates down the ballot, as this would give them more control over political outcomes.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Winning the House and Senate is [important](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/17/senate-election-results-2020-us-who-won-house-representatives-congress/) to give the President the freedom to act.
1.1.4.3. Con: If the Democrats were trying to get away with voter fraud, then acting in a concentrated manner would make the most sense.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: When voter fraud does occur, there is often [evidence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-voterfraudcases.pdf). Similarly, the more fraud, the more evidence. Therefore, concentrating the fraud on one race alone gives cover to the Democrats.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: The Trump campaign is alleging fraud happened in multiple states. That would surely then make their fraud attempts more obvious and ultimately futile.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Given the resources required to carry out voter fraud, concentrating them on one race would be more efficient.
1.1.4.3.3. Con: Just winning the presidency would provide little benefit to the Democrats.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: They would have insufficient power to roll back many of Trump's actions without Senate approval.
1.1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Republicans will likely refuse to reverse [Trump's tax cuts](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/trumps-tax-cuts-were-a-disaster-naturally-republicans-want-even-more/) for the rich.
1.1.4.3.3.1.2. Con: There exists bipartisan support for policies that Trump opposed, like [Middle East interventions](https://www.worldatlarge.news/world-conflict/2020/5/1/the-bipartisan-foreign-policy-consensus-in-the-us-continually-calls-for-conflict-and-occupation) and [unrestricted free trade](https://www.cato.org/blog/bipartisan-consensus-destroy-us-trade-policy).
1.1.4.3.3.1.2.1. Con: Trump generally did not meaningfully oppose the status quo, and was steered by his staff and his party into adopting positions more closely aligned to the bipartisan Washington consensus on many occasions.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Con: Merely getting rid of Trump is the main goal of Democrats.
1.1.4.3.3.2.1. Pro: Democrats wish to return the [norms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/lifestyle/magazine/trump-presidential-norm-breaking-list/) which Trump dismantled while in office.
1.1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: Democrats oppose the changes Trump implemented in government agencies like [the EPA](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html).
1.1.4.3.3.2.3. Con: Biden has a [comprehensive](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/biden-has-an-ambitious-climate-policy-heres-what-it-means-for-alternative-energy-stocks.html) set of policy plans which require legislative approval.
1.1.4.3.3.3. Con: Democrats can use executive orders to get their way.
1.1.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: There has already been a large call for Biden to [eliminate student debt using an executive order](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/biden-student-loan-debt-cancel). This is a policy that most Republicans oppose.
1.1.4.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Biden's own statements and record on debt forgiveness, as well as his apparent desire act as a bipartisan unifier, suggest that he is unlikely to do so.
1.1.4.3.3.3.2. Con: Democrats would prefer not to have to rely on executive orders, as many can be reversed should they lose the White House in future elections.
1.1.4.3.3.4. Pro: The lackluster results for Democrats have set off [major internal fighting](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/13/httpscomposergutoolscoukcontent5fad6c2d8f08e0d6ec8180ed) between moderate and progressive wings of the party regarding who is responsible.
1.1.5. Con: There are [five states](https://ballotpedia.org/All-mail_voting#States_with_existing.2C_permanent_automatic_mail-in_ballot_systems), including heavily-Republican Utah, that use mail-in ballots exclusively.
1.1.5.1. Con: The link states that all of the states mentioned have in-person voting and automatic mail in ballots. Just click on the link and hover your cursor over the states on the map. At the end of the description you will see that in person voting is available.
1.2. Pro: The use of technology in the US election led to widespread voter fraud.
1.2.1. Pro: Many electronic votes were simply uncounted. During their recount by hand, Georgia [uncovered thousands of uncounted votes](https://www.news4jax.com/news/georgia/2020/11/18/4th-georgia-county-finds-uncounted-votes-as-hand-count-deadline-approaches/).
1.2.1.1. Con: The real number of uncounted votes in Georgia is in the [hundreds and will be unable to swing the state](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/vote2020/2020/11/18/Recount-finds-thousands-of-Georgia-votes-missing-from-initial-counts/stories/202011180178), even if Trump won all of those votes.
1.2.1.2. Con: The state of Georgia recounted all their votes by hand and came to [largely the same result](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/georgia-recount-election-results/index.html).
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Even if the technology had changed people's votes, counting every individual ballot by hand would uncover that. Since the count found no systematic irregularity, Biden legitimately won the state.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: The Georgia recount is still close enough to [warrant another recount](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-campaign-asks-another-georgia-recount-n1248538).
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Narrow victories are a staple of all elections. At some point someone must be declared a winner.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: There are types of fraud which would not necessarily be found by counting by hand.
1.2.1.3. Con: A [federal judge](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/19/federal-judge-rejects-trump-allys-bid-block-election-certification-georgia-438563), whom Trump himself appointed, refused to block the certification of votes in Georgia.
1.2.1.4. Pro: While the Georgia Governor certified the results, he called for an [audit](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-gov-brian-kemp-certifies-election-results-calls-for-audit) of the results.
1.2.2. Pro: Automatic voter registration caused people to be [erroneously registered](https://news.wttw.com/2020/01/22/spotlight-politics-hundreds-erroneously-registered-vote).
1.2.2.1. Con: These people were [found](https://news.wttw.com/2020/01/22/spotlight-politics-hundreds-erroneously-registered-vote) and removed from the voter rolls long before the election.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: We simply cannot rule out the possibly that there were people who were incorrectly registered who were not found before the elections.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Failure to rule out the possibility of erroneous registration is not positive evidence of erroneous registration, let alone on a great enough scale to influence the election results.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: The fact that AVR led to some people being erroneously registered, evidences this as a possibility, and there may be more people that we are unaware of who were registered.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The mere possibility of erroneous voter registration in other, yet-to-be-discovered instances is not evidence of such instances.
1.2.2.2. Pro: 100s of non-citizens were registered to vote in [Illinois](https://khqa.com/news/local/glitch-registers-hundreds-of-non-us-citizens-to-vote-in-illinois-01-22-2020) as a result of a glitch in the automatic voter registration system.
1.2.2.3. Con: An erroneous registration does not constitute voter fraud
1.2.3. Con: Many of the apparent failures of technology were actually the result of human error, and so were quickly [rectified](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/technology/biden-michigan-votes.html).
1.2.3.1. Con: Given the amount of election infrastructure that relied on technology, and how [easy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/22/us-elections-hacking-voting-machines-def-con) it is to hack election technology, we do not know if there were any mistakes that were left un-rectified.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Hacking voting machines in a real world scenario is not easy. It would require gaining access to storage facilities, bypassing armed guards, breaking the seals, altering the software/machines, then resealing the machines with a forged seal. Any alteration would also have to pass subsequent hand-count audits.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: The fact that we cannot rule out the possibility of un-rectified errors is not evidence that such errors actually exist, let alone on a scale that would alter the election results. There are lots of possibilities that cannot be ruled out, but that doesn't mean we need to accept them as true, or even plausible.
1.2.3.2. Pro: A chunk of votes that were miscalculated for Biden in a heavily Republican area, and they were [rerun](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1640_9150-544676--,00.html) to ensure they were correct.
1.2.3.3. Pro: A data glitch in Decision Desk HQ's software appeared to show that Biden received 100 percent of [138,000 votes](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/11/4/21549710/biden-michigan-votes-trump-retweet-election-map), but this was quickly fixed.
1.2.4. Con: There have not been any documented cases of technology being manipulated to achieve voter fraud, let alone widespread voter fraud.
1.2.5. Pro: Voting machines were subject to fraud in the US election.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The machines allowed employees to delete votes.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump claims as many as [2.7 million votes were changed nationwide](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1326926226888544256).
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: This claim was based off [a human error that only briefly led to incorrect information](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/13/politics/dominion-voting-false-claim-delete-trump-votes-fact-check/index.html) being sent off in just one Michigan county.
1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: The source from which Trump found this is a right-wing conspiracy website that [did not even conduct a proper statistical study](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/12/donald-trump/trumps-tweet-about-27-million-deleted-votes-basele/) to derive this number.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: There is [no evidence of this claim](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54959962) and the source from which Donald Trump got this figure has refused to follow up on questions asking for evidence.
1.2.5.2. Pro: The company behind these machines, Dominion, has a checkered history.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Many within the Trump campaign claim the Dominion technology was [developed and used](https://www.wbap.com/news/sidney-powell-to-newsmax-tv-dominion-designed-to-rig-elections/) to rig Venezuelan elections for Hugo Chavez
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: The only evidence that has been given to back this up just points that [the company's founders are Venezuelan](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9740535009). That is not sufficient.
1.2.5.2.1.2. Con: Most who supported this claim have [walked it back](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/21/fox-newsmax-walk-back-claims-in-face-of-legal-threat/) and no longer suggest it is true.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: Dominion is fairly non-partisan and [has donated to both Democrats and Republicans](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54959962).
1.2.5.2.2.1. Con: A company's donations has no bearing on whether its product was or wasn't used to commit election fraud.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: Dominion machines are [fairly widespread in Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ontarios-experiment-with-vote-counting-machines-could-change-elections-to-come/), and there have been no serious allegations of vote tampering.
1.2.5.2.3.1. Con: [Elections Canada](https://globalnews.ca/news/7468534/trump-elections-canada-tweet/) have since tweeted that they do not use Dominion machines.
1.2.5.2.3.1.1. Con: Elections Canada themselves have said that the fact that they do not use Dominion voting machines is [evidence](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-trump-points-to-elections-canadas-disavowal-of-voting-machines/) of nothing broader than the fact that they do not use those machines.
1.2.5.2.3.1.2. Pro: The fact that Canada does not use these machines is an indictment of the quality and safety of these machines.
1.2.5.2.4. Con: Dominion machines were used to count over [70 million votes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/toronto-firm-dominon-trump-voter-fraud-1.5806983) in 2016, across many states that Trump carried.
1.2.5.2.5. Pro: The machines that were widely used in the US elections were rejected on multiple occasions by [Texas officials](https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/hannity-a-deep-dive-into-the-voting-machines-at-center-of-controversy).
1.2.5.2.5.1. Con: Being rejected by Texas does not serve as evidence that the machines were used to commit widespread fraud, or that the company has a questionable history.
1.2.5.3. Con: From a technological perspective, this was actually the [safest US election in history](https://abc7news.com/election-results-2020-presidential-security/7906662/).
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: There exist [paper records for every vote](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/13/21563825/2020-elections-most-secure-dhs-cisa-krebs) in close states, that allow counters to double-check their overall counts.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Trump's own [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://apnews.com/article/top-officials-elections-most-secure-66f9361084ccbc461e3bbf42861057a5) have said the technology used in the election presents no threat.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: The head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency lost his job on account of these claims.
1.2.5.3.2.1.1. Con: It was Donald Trump who fired Christopher Krebs, head of the CISA. This move by Trump has been widely [condemned](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Krebs-firing-proves-Trump-can-t-15737201.php).
1.2.5.3.2.2. Pro: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency set up a large [operation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/30/dhs-is-planning-largest-ever-operation-secure-us-election-against-hacking/) to combat electoral fraud in advance of the election.
1.3. Pro: Voter fraud occurred with regards to voter registration.
1.3.1. Pro: A [man in Los Angeles](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-17/hawthorne-men-accused-in-voter-fraud-plot-to-attain-8-000-mail-ballots-for-nonexistent-or-deceased-persons) attempted to register 8,000 non-existent or deceased voters.
1.3.1.1. Con: The man was unsuccessful at registering such voters, which demonstrates how hard it is to commit voter fraud.
1.3.2. Pro: Voters who were no longer [resident](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/524749-nevada-republican-party-sends-criminal-referral-to-doj-alleging-thousands) in Nevada were able to vote there.
1.3.2.1. Pro: 3062 individuals voted in [Nevada](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/524749-nevada-republican-party-sends-criminal-referral-to-doj-alleging-thousands), after they moved out of the state.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: These votes may not be illegal, as the American Civil Liberties Union highlights that a person who moves less than [30 days](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/nevada-republican-party/fact-checking-republican-claim-illegal-votes-nevad/) before an election is allowed cast their ballot in either their old or new state of residence.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Since it is [states](https://americancenterjapan.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Election_in_Brief_ENG_10.pdf) who are in charge of voting, rather than the federal government, we do not know whether any of these people voted twice.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: Of the 3062 names, a [significant number are linked to military addresses](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/11/10/gop-list-of-alleged-voter-fraud-nevada-contains-hundreds-of-military-addresses.html): including Army Post Office \(APO\) addresses, Fleet Post Office \(FPO\) addresses, and Diplomatic Post Office \(DPO\) addresses. It also contains hundreds of addresses in cities known to have large military populations.
1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.3.2.3. Con: The margin of victory in Nevada is significantly greater than the number of votes alleged to be [fraudulent](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/07/932481031/ap-calls-nevada-for-joe-biden?t=1605889110720).
1.3.3. Con: Claims that Wisconsin turnout jumped 22 percent to 89 percent overall, were [misleading](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/05/fact-check-wisconsin-voter-turnout-line-past-elections/6176028002/).
1.3.3.1. Pro: The claim that 89 percent of eligible voters voted [ignores](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/05/fact-check-wisconsin-voter-turnout-line-past-elections/6176028002/) the fact that Wisconsin allows same day voter registration.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Breitbart, and other conservative outlets, were forced to print redactions, after erroneously posting the [misleading story](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/04/wisconsin-vote-turnout-indicates-7-in-10-voted/).
1.3.3.3. Con: Wisconsin saw almost [record high turnout](https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/madison/news/2020/11/06/five-takeaways-from-the-2020-election-in-wisconsin) in 2020, which, while not as high as 89 percent, is still suspicious.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The turnout rate of almost [73 percent](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/04/wisconsin-vote-turnout-indicates-7-in-10-voted/) is higher than every other year, except 2004, when there was a smaller electorate.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: Wisconsin voters were [mobilized](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/16/joe-biden-black-lives-matter-wisconsin-jacob-blake) in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, which helped lead to greater turnout.
1.3.4. Pro: [Dead people](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/12/true-the-vote-lawsuit-dead-people-felons-voted-illegally-in-michigan/) were registered to vote in the 2020 election.
1.3.4.1. Con: Just because dead people were registered to vote, does not mean that there was fraud. Often, this is simply a delay in removing the names of the [deceased](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/18/dead-voter-conspiracy-theory-debunked) from the rolls.
1.3.4.2. Con: Votes by dead people are often votes that are [misallocated](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/michigan-dead-voter-fact-debunking/index.html) from a dead parent to their child of the same name and address.
1.3.4.3. Pro: At least one vote is suspected to have been cast in the name of a dead person in [New York](https://nypost.com/2020/11/02/dead-people-caught-voting-in-nyc-elections-records-show/).
1.3.4.4. Con: Some of the people named as 'dead' voters by the Trump campaign are [actually alive](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54874120).
1.3.5. Con: While some outlets claimed that more people voted in [Wisconsin](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-wisconsin-vote-vs-voters-afs:Content:9672223878) than were registered, this claim was proven untrue.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The claim that there were more votes cast than voter registered stemmed from the use of the [2018](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-wisconsin-vote-vs-voters-afs:Content:9672223878) figures for how many voters were registered in Wisconsin.
1.3.6. Con: Claims were made that more people voted in some [Michigan](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55016029) counties than were registered, although these were later shown to be false.
1.3.6.1. Pro: The counties shown in the document used as proof were actually in [Minnesota](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55016029).
1.3.6.2. Pro: The [turnout figures](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55016029) on the reported affidavits are entirely incorrect.
1.4. Con: There have been numerous failed legal challenges to the results of the US election.
1.4.1. Pro: Many of these suits have been rejected as they make [outlandish, unsubstantiated claims](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201112/15314645697/trump-campaign-gets-laughed-out-court-claiming-bunch-unvetted-webform-submissions-is-evidence-voter-fraud.shtml).
1.4.1.1. Pro: Some courts, like [the Pennsylvania Supreme Court](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-bid-supreme-court-election-intervention-fails-materialize/story?id=74253542), have refused to consider the petition, deeming it too untenable.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: A Republican judge on a lower court in Pennsylvania delivered a [scathing](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-donald-trump-pennsylvania-elections-talk-radio-433b6efe72720d8648221f405c2111f9) ruling of the Trump administration's efforts in court.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Many of the lawsuits have been based on [rumors that could be immediately disproven](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/13/trump-legal-team-cases-dropped-436492).
1.4.1.3. Pro: The Trump campaign has [distanced](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/23/trump-campaign-cuts-ties-with-attorney-sidney-powell-after-bizarre-election-claims) itself from lawyer Sidney Powell over her claims of electoral fraud.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: The Trump campaign is still [making the same arguments that Sidney Powell made](https://www.wsj.com/articles/giuliani-says-sidney-powell-not-part-of-trumps-legal-team-11606088107). Their concern was with her behavior, not her arguments.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Indeed, Trump is reportedly worried that all of his legal team consists of ["fools that are making him look bad"](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/trump-fears-giuliani-and-other-biden-vote-challenge-lawyers-are-fools.html).
1.4.1.4. Pro: December has seen more [rulings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/07/another-weekend-another-batch-brutal-legal-filings-trump-backed-voter-fraud-effort/) go against the Trump administration, in Georgia and Michigan.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Despite its new conservative majority, the Supreme Court has [denied the request](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/09/politics/trump-election-fraud-claims-supreme-court-rebuke/index.html) to block the certification of Pennsylvania's results.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: [Texas sued](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/08/texas-lawsuit-donald-trump-election-georgia-michigan-pennsylvania-wisconsin) Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to challenge rule changes they made before the election.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: The lawsuit accuses these states' rule changes of making it [easier to commit fraud](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/08/texas-lawsuit-donald-trump-election-georgia-michigan-pennsylvania-wisconsin).
1.4.1.4.2.2. Con: Texas' suit essentially boiled down to disapproval of how other states run their elections. As such, the Supreme Court found that Texas lacked standing to bring the case, and it was thrown out.
1.4.2. Pro: The lawyers representing Trump have been oddly reluctant to present evidence of their claims of fraud.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Despite claims about major [centralized fraud coordinated with foreign powers](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-legal-team-false-claims-5abd64917ef8be9e9e2078180973e8b3), there has been little information given to the media.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: They have even been unwilling to give evidence to Trump-supporting commentators like [Tucker Carlson](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-rudy-giuliani-sidney-powell-election-fraud).
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Powell [stopped coordinating](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/trump-sidney-powell-tucker-carlson-tweet-b1759204.html) with Carlson after he became increasingly rude.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Rudeness is a very petty reason not to provide such earth-shattering evidence as Powell claims to have, especially regarding such an important matter.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Trump lawyer Sidney Powell has made [baseless allegations](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/19/fact-checking-the-trump-campaigns-wild-press-conference/) about the involvement of Venezuala and even George Soros.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: Given Trump's perception of the media is wholeheartedly [negative](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/internet-made-fake-news-thing-made-nothing/), it would not be expected that he would work with the media.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: If Trump's re-election is at stake and he had actual evidence of massive voter fraud, he might be willing to provide the details to the public in some form, even if it's just though Twitter.
1.4.2.2. Con: The campaign is [still in the progress of collecting all the evidence](https://www.wvlkam.com/news/sidney-powell-will-prove-case-within-next-two-weeks-in-court/). When it is ready, they can display it all.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: If the team still has too little evidence to show, then they should not be making these dangerous claims until all the evidence is gathered.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: The campaign has a responsibility to show their evidence in court, and nowhere else.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: The campaign knows that mainstream media will trash any evidence presented. If they want it to be taken seriously they must wait until it can be shown in its most complete form.
1.4.3. Con: Some of these cases, while they have failed, have not provided satisfactory explanations for the result, which could open the door for appeals.
1.4.3.1. Con: Many of the cases have been [dismissed with prejudice](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/arizona-pennsylvania-georgia-lawsuits-trump-biden/index.html), meaning they cannot be appealed to a higher court.
1.4.3.2. Pro: A judge in [Arizona](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-18c9a1eef016f2e7f2cda7e443620dc1) did not provide a reasoning while rejecting an application from the state GOP.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: The judge has since [provided reasoning](https://www.azmirror.com/2020/12/22/judge-shreds-state-gop-lawsuit-in-dismissal-ruling/) for rejecting the suit filed by the GOP. In his ruling, he points out that conducting the hand recount of ballots in Maricopa County in the manner requested by Republicans would have been illegal.
1.4.3.3. Con: An appeal to the Supreme Court is unlikely to occur [before](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-bid-supreme-court-election-intervention-fails-materialize/story?id=74253542) states certify their results.
1.4.4. Pro: Only Democrat wins are being challenged, and only the votes for the president, even though the Senate and the House votes were on the same ballots. This suggests that claims of fraud are not truly believed; otherwise, opponents would be challenging all votes for all offices.
1.4.5. Pro: Despite allegations of fraud, [very few of the Trump campaign's lawsuits](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/22/chris-christie-tells-trump-its-time-to-end-legal-fights-over-election.html) make reference to fraud.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Many of the lawsuits [do not even make claims that would invalidate votes](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-s-election-fight-includes-over-30-lawsuits-it-s-n1248289): instead, they challenge the proximity with which observers were allowed to stand to counters.
1.4.5.2. Pro: That Trump is alleging fraud publically, but refuses to do the same legally is an indication that he is lying and trying to steal the election.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: If he had any real evidence of fraud, surely that would be the central focus of his lawsuits.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: There is a high bar for proving fraud in court. There are pragmatic reasons for not wanting to tackle that burden, that don't necessarily indicate he's lying.
1.4.6. Con: Individual citizens believe in voter fraud to the extent that they have [challenged](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/case-by-case-trump-s-legal-challenges-to-us-election-outcome-1.4411730) the results of the elections across key states.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Several have signed [affidavits](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/526926-trump-lawyers-cited-minnesota-counties-in-affidavit-about-michigan-report) claiming they saw voter fraud occurring.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: These affidavits [fail to show](https://eu.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/11/trump-lawsuit-affidavits-allege-misconduct-do-not-show-widespread-fraud/6247949002/) widespread voter fraud.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: One even [confused Michigan with Minnesota](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/20/trump-lawsuit-mixes-up-red-flags-michigan-minnesota/6362056002/).
1.4.6.2. Con: Anecdotal evidence is insufficient to challenge the results of an election.
1.4.6.3. Pro: The time, money and resources required to launch a court case to challenge elections results is so considerable, that it demonstrates the ferocity with which people believe these claims.
1.4.7. Con: Many of Trump's legal challenges are still [awaiting results](https://whyy.org/articles/a-cheat-sheet-for-the-trump-election-lawsuits-still-alive-in-pa/).
1.4.7.1. Con: Even if Trump wins all the court cases he has filed, [they do not refer to enough votes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/trump-campaign-s-legal-blitz-isn-t-targeting-enough-votes-to-win) to change any of the results in any of the close states.
1.4.7.2. Pro: One big win could set a precedent to review other results.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: Considering [the large number](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/elections/trump-campaign-lawsuits.html) of rejected lawsuits, it is unlikely that any victory would be considered anything other than a problem within the specific state where the issue is being raised.
1.4.7.3. Pro: There are a number of cases that the [US Supreme Court](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/12/11/arizona-gop-chair-takes-voter-fraud-lawsuit-to-supreme-court/) is being asked to weigh in on.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: It is unlikely the Supreme Court will substantiate any of the claims of voter fraud, since, in the Arizona case, the state [Superior Court and Supreme Court](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/12/11/arizona-gop-chair-takes-voter-fraud-lawsuit-to-supreme-court/) both failed to find evidence of voter fraud.
1.5. Con: While there was fraud in the 2020 election, none of it was on a wide enough scale to have made a difference to the outcome of the election.
1.5.1. Pro: The examples of proven voter fraud in the 2020 elections amount to no more than isolated examples, rather than a concerted and widespread effort to undermine the election.
1.5.1.1. Pro: There were some instances of [double voting](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/11/21560269/election-virtually-no-evidence-voter-fraud-nyt) in the 2020 election, but on a small scale, as is usually seen in presidential elections.
1.5.1.2. Pro: A single individual voted on behalf of his [daughter](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/michigan-man-facing-felony-charges-for-voter-fraud-ag-says.html) in the 2020 election.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: This, while being voter fraud, does not amount to the widescale fraud that is being alleged by Donald Trump.
1.5.1.3. Con: What seem to be isolated instances of fraud could be part of a wider conspiracy.
1.5.1.4. Pro: Two men were caught committing voter fraud in Los Angeles County, however their intention was to win a [mayoral race](https://nypost.com/2020/11/17/la-duo-charged-with-voter-fraud-in-bid-to-win-mayoral-election/), and not impact the outcome of the presidential race.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: If people were willing and almost able to commit fraud in a mayoral election, it stands to reason that others tried the same, with the presidential election.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: Voter security around a mayoral election was likely less thorough than that around the presidential election.
1.5.2. Pro: Since 1988, there have only been a little over [1000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-voterfraudcases.pdf) proven cases of voter fraud. It is improbable that this number would rise significantly in 2020.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The extent of voter fraud has been widely exaggerated for many years \([p. 21](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/Report_Truth-About-Voter-Fraud.pdf)\).
1.5.2.2. Con: Some outlets have claimed that the Democrats have a [history](https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/political-insider-explains-voter-fraud-with-mail-in-ballots/) of voter fraud.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: The publisher of these claims, the New York Post, has a conservative [bias](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-post).
1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: They have been willing to publish false and salacious material to benefit Republicans, like with their controversial [Hunter Biden story](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/18/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden-reliable/index.html).
1.5.2.2.2. Con: The source for these claims remained [anonymous](https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/political-insider-explains-voter-fraud-with-mail-in-ballots/), so it is unclear how [reliable](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/public-editor/the-risk-of-unnamed-sources-unconvinced-readers.html) they are.
1.5.3. Con: Joe Biden admitted to creating a [vast voter fraud organization.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/27/kayleigh-mcenany/white-house-press-secretary-mcenany-takes-bidens-w/)
1.5.3.1. Con: Joe Biden simply misspoke, as the clip in question was him discussing an organization to [combat](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-fact-check-biden-voter-protection-not-idUSKBN27E2VH) voter fraud.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: This clip is only seen as evidence because conservative media refuses to play the rest of it.
1.5.4. Con: Rudy Giuliani has claimed there existed a [widescale fraud effort](https://www.wsj.com/articles/giuliani-joins-election-case-seeking-to-delay-pennsylvania-results-11605628941) in Pennsylvania.
1.5.4.1. Con: Rudy Giuliani is a pretty unreliable source and, therefore, should not be trusted.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: In his recent courtroom appearance, he seemed to have forgotten even [basic legal terminology](https://apnews.com/article/rudy-giuliani-returns-courtroom-trump-b81328c5a74ab348d8b7e21f93eed3f9).
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Rudy Giuliani has spent the last four years saying pretty [blatant falsehoods](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/list/?speaker=rudy-giuliani&ruling=false).
1.5.4.1.3. Pro: Rudy Giuliani, as Donald Trump's personal lawyer, is [biased](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384028-giuliani-joins-trump-legal-team).
1.5.4.1.4. Con: Rudy Giuliani won Time's [Person of the Year Award](https://web.archive.org/web/20110224024726/http://www.time.com/time/poy2001/poyprofile.html), and is considered 'America's Mayor' and so should be trusted.
1.5.4.1.4.1. Con: That had nothing to do with Giuliani's potential abilities as a lawyer.
1.5.4.1.5. Con: Rudy Giuliani has an impressive history as an attorney.
1.5.4.1.5.1. Pro: Giuliani rose to national prominence when he [prosecuted the mafia](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/us/rudy-giuliani-fast-facts/index.html) in New York in the 1980s.
1.5.4.1.5.2. Con: Many of Giuliani's former confidants say they have noticed a [marked change in his behavior](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/rudy-giuliani-new-york-trump-997712/) since his days as a prosecutor and mayor.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Giuliani has claimed these cases of fraud are part of a [centralized strategy](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/giuliani-presses-trump-election-challenge-case-in-fiery-news-conference).
1.5.4.2.1. Con: [Giuliani himself has admitted](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/11/23/giuliani-trump-voter-fraud-claim-exaggeration-sot-ac360-vpx.cnn) that his allegations are exaggerated.
1.5.4.3. Con: Most of Giuliani's witnesses to this have been problematic.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Melissa Carone had [extensive personal issues](https://www.thecut.com/2020/12/giulianis-star-witness-mellissa-carone-accused-of-it-crime.html) leading up to her testimony and harbored a clear animosity towards her former employer, Dominion Voting Systems.
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: One witness made [flagrantly racist comments](https://www.thewrap.com/trump-election-fraud-witness-says-we-need-voter-id-because-all-chinese-look-alike-video/) during her testimony.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: Many of them signed affidavits, meaning they are willing to go to face legal punishment for perjury if they are found lying.
1.5.4.3.3.1. Con: The courts which have been assessing these affidavits have not the individuals are lying. They say that witnesses' accounts are either [uninformed or untrustworthy](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/politics/2020/12/04/evidence-hearsay-voter-fraud-claims-in-affidavits-explained/).
1.5.4.3.3.2. Con: Due to the feverish rhetoric from the Trump camp, many witnesses simply [misinterpreted small mistakes](https://eu.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/12/03/trump-lawsuits-challenging-election-michigan-arizona-pennsylvania-georgia/6425725002/) they saw as attempts at fraud.
1.6. Con: Donald Trump already has a track record of lying about election results to generate support among his outraged base, so it stands to reason he would do the same thing again.
1.6.1. Pro: Following the 2016 election, Trump repeatedly claimed, without substantiating evidence, that [millions of votes](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-again-claims-massive-vote-fraud-massive-search-evidence-finds-n863096) were cast illegally and that he was the legitimate winner of the popular vote.
1.6.2. Con: Whether Trump makes false claims doesn't change whether or not there was fraud; the two are not mutually exclusive
1.6.2.1. Con: Because Trump wants to foster the belief among his supporters that the election results were fraudulent, he has a vested interest in making false claims about voter fraud specifically.
1.7. Con: There is no evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election.
1.7.1. Pro: Very few reputable sources have lent credence to allegations of voter fraud.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Texas’s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, promised to pay out $25,000 to each person who came forward with evidence of voter fraud. To date, he has paid [no one.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/04/trump-voter-fraud-america-false)
1.7.1.2. Pro: Several conservative news outlets including Fox News, Newsmax, OANN, and American Thinker issued lengthy [retractions of claims made on their programs regarding Dominion machines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/12/21/fox-news-newsmax-walk-back-election-fraud-claims-after-voting-machine-manufacturer-threatens-legal-action/?sh=5f8664eecfd2).
1.7.1.3. Con: Most mainstream news sources [openly supported Joe Biden](https://www.ft.com/content/3faf0f87-c9da-49ad-8a35-1538b3b683c4) over Donald Trump.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Major news sources in the US have [always been ideologically biased](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=637508&p=4462444). Despite this, they have not been unable to call and report on elections before.
1.7.1.3.1.1. Con: The people's trust in the media in the US has [fallen to dangerously low levels](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321116/americans-remain-distrustful-mass-media.aspx). Therefore, the media can no longer be seen as representing the people.
1.7.1.3.1.2. Pro: The same major news sites were able and willing to call senatorial and congressional victories for Republicans.
1.7.1.3.2. Pro: Therefore, they are predisposed to [distrust and deny](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/06/22/3-partisan-environments-views-of-political-conversations-and-disagreements/) the claims of their opponents.
1.7.1.4. Pro: Republican certifiers in Michigan who initially refused to certify the election results were [forced to certify them](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/18/republican-certifiers-in-michigan-back-down-after-refusing-to-approve-biden-win) when they could not provide sufficient evidence of their claims.
1.7.1.4.1. Con: Republican certifiers in Wayne County, Michigan, have asked to [rescind](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wayne-county-republican-canvassers-rescind-votes-certifying-election/story?id=74290114&__twitter_impression=true) their votes to certify the results.
