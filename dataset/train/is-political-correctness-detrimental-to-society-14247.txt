Discussion Name: Is political correctness detrimental to society?

1. Political correctness is detrimental to society.
1.1. Con: Political correctness encourages civility in society, and as such enables discourse.
1.1.1. Pro: A civilised society needs a political discourse where issues can be discussed on their merits, without discussions getting derailed by ad-hominem attacks.
1.1.1.1. Con: PC culture is not always up for discussion, for example, [chanting](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=10607) over the top of people with different views.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Political correctness encourages meaningful discourse by discouraging inflammatory language.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Inflammatory language/ideas are the reasons we debate in the first place. If no one felt it was inflammatory, no one would care to have a discourse.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Political correctness opens discourse and dialogue for members of society who don't feel they are allowed to speak or be heard.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: There are no studies that suggest that forcing others to discontinue the use of certain words will open up dialogue. More so the parent claim undermines years of hard work that currently gives these people a platform to talk on.
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In some toxic environments, creating a language protocol to ease tensions can help parties gain understanding. John Gottman discusses this in his research on marriage, ["...they will find ways to express their needs and concerns respectfully without criticizing or blaming their partner."](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-top-7-ways-to-improve-your-marriage/)
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Political correctness does not hinder communication or restrict arguments, only requires that they are framed respectfully. Instead of allowing exclusionary or insulting language against an individual or group, political correctness requires that ideas stand on their own merits.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: College students protested a speech by Charles Murray, saying ["This is not an issue of freedom of speech... \[I\]n this case we find the principle does not apply, due to not only the nature, but also the quality, of Dr. Murray’s scholarship"](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/03/middlebury-students-shout-down-lecture-charles-murray) because Murray's work is widely known to use ["pseudoscience and misleading statistics"](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/charles-murray) & [unscientifically](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/the-real-problem-with-charles-murray-and-the-bell-curve/)["ignores any data that contradicts its point of view"](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-14/news/mn-8926_1_bell-curve).
1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Murray himself is agnostic about the parts of his research people [find controversial](https://quillette.com/2017/06/11/no-voice-vox-sense-nonsense-discussing-iq-race/) and is careful, even in his book, to caution people about making any connections between his work and individuals.
1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Though Murray may superficially claim to caution against making connections between his work and individuals, he functionally encourages the opposite. Murray devotes [several chapters](https://www.intelltheory.com/bellcurve.shtml#part4) of the Bell Curve to recommending social policy based on his research. This constitutes a recommendation for how governments should treat individuals based on his research.
1.1.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: These policies are concerned with how society might address cognitive disparities in an information economy \( vs labor economy \) rather than race, sexual preference ...etc.
1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Murray's equivocations about his own work reflect a [Motte And Bailey](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey) tactic that further proves the point of the great-grandparent claim that he was deplatformed for acting in bad faith rather than for his research.
1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This may be true, but is difficult to say without telepathy. What is more clear is that some have higher IQs than others.
1.1.1.2.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: More evident than Murray's actual intentions is the idea that high IQs could result in a caste system in an information based economy. Murray could be dishonest as to his intentions, but this wouldn't change the truth value of these concerns.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: It may be true that harm and insult arise through the listener's interpretation. However, if both the speaker and listener engage in good faith, then insults may only occur when the speaker's words are vague enough to be open to interpretation. Thus, political correctness motivates people to word their ideas more clearly and precisely.
1.1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: A speaker might say "Men are better at sports than women," which they believe is an objective fact. A female listener may take this to mean "All men are better at sports than all women," which is demonstrably false. If the speaker had instead said, "The average man is able to perform better at most athletic feats than the average woman is," it would be more clear, demonstrable, and unlikely to insult someone operating in good faith.
1.1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Political correctness forces people to articulate their ideas more rigorously, without resorting to a lazy disparaging of downtrodden groups as a rhetorical strategy.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: Political correctness doesn't force people to articulate ideas more rigorously, it only forces people to attempt to articulate arguments in a manner deemed inoffensive. For any progress to be achieved in society, people have to risk offending someone.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: PC culture can never stop people from offending others if they insist on doing so. It just means the offense will be met with criticism.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Con: This implies that "brutal honesty" is the only way to advance society. Human psychology suggests otherwise. People tend to [not respond well](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2013/11/04/5-critical-steps-to-fearless-confrontation/#77cf10532b4d) to a confrontational discussion style.
1.1.1.2.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: A common complaint is that PC advocates are too aggressive and alienate others by criticizing their speech. Either one should be respectful and compassionate to reach people, or one should be completely straightforward.
1.1.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Political correctness also forces people to address the cause of stereotypes \(positive and negative\) rather than simply accepting them as given.
1.1.1.2.3.3.3. Con: If there is no respect and moderation in PC culture on both sides, only those who want to invest time in being disparaged, outcast, insulted, accused of being racist, bigoted, misogynist, etc. will learn the essential skills to articulate their ideas more effectively. Others will just stay quiet and fester their ideas in underground groups.
1.1.1.2.3.4. Con: Political correctness does not only restrict language, but [ideas](https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-71-americans-say-political-correctness-has-silenced-discussions-society-needs-have-58-have), [arguments](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/16/james-damore-google-memo-interview-autism-regrets), [facts](https://www.acsh.org/news/2016/08/11/political-correctness-prevents-advancement-of-science) and [beliefs](https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/03/christian-persecution-ignored-political-correctness-9400904/).
1.1.1.2.3.5. Con: A quick Google search with the word "Deplatforming" will reveal a tactic used by the some on the PC Left to "hinder communication or restrict arguments". [The center Left is not entirely comfortable with this either.](https://www.thestranger.com/features/2018/09/26/32884518/there-is-a-much-smarter-way-to-deal-with-controversial-speakers-than-deplatforming)
1.1.1.2.3.5.1. Con: When proponents of PC seek to deplatform someone, it is because they believe the person is operating in bad faith.
1.1.1.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: Many [protested](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/uc-berkely-protests-milo-yiannopoulos-publicly-name-undocumented-students-cancelled-talk-illegals-a7561321.html) Milo Yiannopoulos being invited to "free speech" events on campus because he publicly identifies private persons to make them [targets](http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/21/uc-berkeley-students-harassed-after-milo-yiannopoulos-publicly-identifies-them/) of ridicule and harassment.
1.1.1.2.3.5.2. Con: It is fair to say that there are those who, under the guise of PC, will attempt to stifle others. It is not reasonable to dismiss PC as a whole because of some people within it. The question is where the line between requiring respectful framing, and 'deplatforming' falls.
1.1.1.2.3.5.3. Pro: -> See discussion #1764: Social justice movements should abandon the use of [no-platforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUS_No_Platform_Policy) at universities
1.1.1.2.4. Con: Discourse can be carried out with inflammatory language. Trying to deny one's words because they are inflammatory rather than because factual inaccuracies does not help progress meaningful discourse.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: [Inflammatory language](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inflammatory) is inherently in opposition to meaningful dialogue.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: That is an irrelevant conclusion. Just because inflammatory language can incite anger does not mean that the dialogue at hand is unsubstantial.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Meaningful discourse rarely happens in the presence of inflammatory language. Inflammatory language communicates a lack of interest in the opposing side's argument and shuts down meaningful debate
1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Inflammatory language does not in and of itself convey a lack of interest.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: True statements, regardless of whether the language is inflammatory, are good and encourage development, no matter what is said. By being in conflict, there is mutual development as ideas and concerns are voiced at each other.
1.1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Inflammatory language make its harder to hear the truth in statements. Inflammatory language is not designed to engage people, it is designed to shut people down, make them less open to considering alternative viewpoints.
1.1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Refraining from inflammatory remarks is a a sign of [intellectual humility](https://cct.biola.edu/we-know-part-debunking-myths-about-intellectual-humility/). Intellectual humility is more likely to promote a spirit of collaboration instead of animosity and competition. Truth takes precedence over ego.
1.1.1.2.4.2.1.2. Con: To enforce this in others through rebuke, censorship and public scolding may be less effective long term than the method, often ascribed to Gandhi: "[Be the change you wish to see in the world](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/10/23/be-change/)".
1.1.1.2.5. Pro: Inflammatory language reduces 'dialogue' to 'argument' and decreases the chances of either side being willing to change their viewpoint. PC attempts to encourage meaningful, rational discourse rather than just shouting at each other.
1.1.1.2.5.1. Con: PC censorship inflames, arouses and foments bad feelings as may be observed here. If bad feelings are off the table then one may argue that this leaves little room for the PC movement.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: 'Bad feelings' are not off the table. The point is that inflammatory language prevents meaningful dialogue by inciting emotion at the expense of reason. The point of PC is to force people to use language which communicates the ideas, but prevents them from using language which will cause the people who disagree with them to react emotionally to an attack instead of attempting to understand and debate ideas.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: There is no consensus on what constitutes political correctness. Therefore, any speech could be considered potentially unacceptable.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a [slippery slope](https://www.thoughtco.com/slippery-slope-logical-fallacy-1692105) logical fallacy. Advocates of political correctness generally agree that politically incorrect statements are those that would offend a disadvantaged or discriminated against group in society.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Not only advocates of political correctness, there is an established [definition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) in this debate of "language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people considered disadvantaged or discriminated against" and that certainly can't be applied to "any speech".
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That definition also indicates that "political correctness" is generally used as a pejorative, implying excessive or unwarranted policies.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: What the general public and the media think about political correctness is unrelated with whether or not there is a consensus on what is unacceptable speech.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: What the general public and the media think is central to political correctness, as there is no consensus as to what is PC or unacceptable speech. In fact, the definition traces a history of shifting, largely political use of "political correctness", by different groups, and in different areas of society.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: "Taking offence" is something personal, and is thus subjective.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: People can't choose how they feel about words, even if it’s subjective you can’t make “any speech” offend you.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Nothing suggests that people are limited in how they can feel about something.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Subjectivity does not mean it can't be measured or analyzed by experts.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.3. Con: A slippery slope argument foretells future events, the parent claim is pointing out an existing problem in the present.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.2. Con: What constitutes political correctness is what we as a society agree on. It is a social construct. As such, it doesn't inherently possess hard criteria. It is our job to reach a consensus on these criteria by having a discussion about them. This is how most of our values and norms have been formed in the past.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: [Political polarization](https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) has only increased in the last decades, trying to reach a consensus with two or more groups who have sorted themselves out as being different from one another is a hard if not impossible task.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Public opinion can't have a hard criteria by its very nature. Public opinion will develop and change by the very passing of time while discussion propells it ever faster. Social norms and attitudes have to be challenged and norms have to changed if we are to move forwards as an intelligent, adaptable species.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: What is civilized and acceptable in public discourse is fluid and changes geographically, by group, by topic. There’s no way to have a universal “political correctness”.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Those affected by non-PC expression typically tell you, and have spoken for ages, about certain words, phrases, or images which inherently disparage them.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Political correctness in itself is always subject of public discourse and changing across regions and communities. There is no need for a "universal" political correctness.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.3.3. Con: The idea of political correctness is not a fixed set of rules, but a continuously developing consensus of what is offensive and what isn't. Although people might disagree on the details, most people in one country / culture could name something that is generally viewed as improper or hateful to say in their particular culture.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: Since there are no quantifiable metrics for 'injustice', 'oppression' and 'hate speech', those who fight for PC have no conditions by which they can win, and thus fight battles without end.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Once begun, as it cannot win without the conditions for victory, the movement will continue until it reshapes all of society in its image, regardless of whether other people want to adopt their views or not.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.5. Pro: PC language is vague, which can cause confusion in some situations. This might lead to incorrect accommodations.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: For example, it is [politically incorrect](https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/words-can-hurt/) to describe someone as “retarded,” with the accepted term usually being “disabled.” A disability could be severe, preventing someone from living on their own \(as it is often interpreted\), or minor \(just requiring lifestyle adjustment\). Sometimes this distinction is crucial, such as in a school or when making an event accessible to the attendees.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.6. Con: While it is true that there is no consensus, that is primarily a problem for those who want to use the pejorative, not for those who are being targeted by it. It enables the users to label anything they choose as politically incorrect and thereby dismiss it from conversation.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7. Pro: What one considers insulting is [subjective](https://www.aish.com/sp/dl/46119397.html). The issue that most people have with political correctness is that people's viewpoints can be considered insulting if they put something in a negative light, even if that viewpoint is based on valid facts.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1. Con: Even if it can not be done perfectly, avoiding insults is always a good idea. Enlightening people about their unintended insults is necessary. Banning or eliminating PC would also eliminate any way for a person to learn that they are being insulting.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.1. Con: Replacing the term "Political Correctness", which is saddled with an ambiguous and checkered definitional past, with less divisive terms, like "civility", "human dignity", "respect", puts the practice and policies of PC back on solid common ground.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: In the world of political correctness, the concepts of "respect" and "human dignity" seem only to extend to members of certain protected groups, while persons not claiming membership to these groups are frequently subjected to degrading and slanderous personal attacks based on miffed feelings rather than objective fact.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.2. Con: Some people might consider facts to be insulting, thus enlightening them about potential insults might be nearly impossible.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.3. Con: What is considered "enlightening people" to the speaker can be interpreted as ["scolding"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pride-and-joy/201203/criticism-part-i-the-harmfulness-criticism-0) to the listener. [Scolding has psychological impacts similar to insult.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stuck/201202/how-survive-being-scolded)
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.4. Pro: Given the [psychological effects of insults](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/28/what-microaggressions-small-slights-serious-consequences/362754002/), making an effort to avoid insulting language where possible is morally responsible.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.4.1. Pro: Free speech is predicated on the assumption that we have an [educated populace](https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2019/11/25/freedom_of_speech_and_liberal_education_110378.html).
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.2. Pro: Political correctness can [stop](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/6382/) someone from saying what is [necessary](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18262887).
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.3. Con: If we can agree that there is certain language which is so unnecessarily insulting that it has no place in civilized discourse, then we have moved from the necessity of political correctness to the necessary level of political correctness.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.3.1. Con: Someone's viewpoint being considered offensive does not mean that their viewpoint is worded in a non-PC way.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.3.2. Con: We already have this in the form of common courtesy.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.3.2.1. Con: Common courtesy becomes less common when members of an 'other' group are involved. While PC culture can go too far, it is often the thing that people complain about when you try to make them show 'common courtesy' to people who are in a group that they don't like, whether based upon sexual orientation, skin color, religion, or politics.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.3.2.1.1. Con: While the extent of common courtesy can be discussed, one would usually equate it with polite and showing manners. If one doesn't do this then one isn't showing common courtesy.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.4. Con: While there are people who use the banner of PC to prevent ideas from being communicated and examined, it is equally true that certain language is used to prevent ideas from being communicated and examined by replacing them with conflict.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.4.1. Con: This is a stalemate where neither side justifies the use of the opposite extreme. The problem that we have is that political correctness is not something that people equate with equality but instead equate with censorship. This might not be a valid assumption for people to make, but due to the fact that political correctness does not have a singular goal the opposite cannot be proven.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.5. Pro: It does not necessarily have to be "put in a negative light". The statement or action just has to be perceived as offensive.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.5.1. Pro: The term [microaggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) captures this idea. This concept makes it possible to say something in good faith, with no bad intent, but still be perceived as aggressive or offensive. The standard for offense is not external and societal, but could conceivably exist at the individual level.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8. Con: Even though there is no consensus on what constitutes political correctness, removing it could result in anything, no matter how outrageous, inflammatory and offensive, being considered perfectly reasonable.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8.1. Con: Social norms [change over time](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/) due to cultural or social pressures.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8.2. Con: It is certainly not clear how social pressures could be removed. Social pressures do not occur in a vacuum, but occur naturally and will remain after the movements and labels have died.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8.3. Con: Removing political correctness does not remove common decency. In fact it could help common decency, because people with certain conflicting views could be heard by others, and others could then help change their views.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8.4. Con: It makes no sense to suggest that we ought not to remove political correctness if we haven't even defined it yet.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.8.4.1. Pro: Without defining what PC is, we would not know what to ban, so we could not ban it.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9. Pro: The term "political correctness" encompasses two main urges -- one constructive, and one destructive. Using language to more accurately reflect the full dignity of historically marginalized people is good and right. Enforcing the idea that fixing our language will fix our injustices doesn't work and alienates potential allies who don't "know the lingo".
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9.1. Pro: Some people use PC terms as a form of [gatekeeping](https://medium.com/\@kyrianne/leftbook-we-need-to-talk-3991558e25d8), to bully or ban a speaker from online groups if the speaker uses a term without realizing it's a slur.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9.2. Con: It is the responsibility of allies to listen and learn from minority groups what they require. If one doesn't "know the lingo" then one's first reaction should be to inquire and learn, not lead the conversation.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9.2.1. Con: If you want someone else to help you, then your first action should be to inquire and learn about their life and motivations. If the person you want to help you isn't politically correct, then you should try to understand the meaning behind their words anyway. You don't want to demand more from those that would help you, than what you actually need.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9.3. Con: Fixing our language alone will not fix all the systemic injustices throughout our culture. However, correcting language can be an entrypoint for people to learn more about--and thus start to fix--those systemic injustices.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9.3.1. Con: Similarly, people might be aggravated and think of it as injustice that they have to change their speech.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10. Con: Many people know what political correctness is, it's just that anti-PC groups lie about [what](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness#False_accusations) political correctness is to deceive people who don't check for themselves into believing a fallacy.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.1. Pro: In recent years, there are often false or exaggerated claims of something PC attacking holidays.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.1.1. Pro: It is [claimed](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/christmas/santa-claus-should-be-female-or-gender-neutral-according-to-nearly-a-third-of-people-survey-reveals/news-story/41f2c58d69d4feadbf1e3834e1ce4233) that people want Santa to be female or gender neutral, when in fact a tabloid asked people a barely related question and interpreted so they could [lie](https://junkee.com/santa-gender-neutral-story/187123) [about](https://startsat60.com/discover/news/dont-worry-santa-claus-is-not-becoming-person-christmas) people wanting a female or gender neutral Santa.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.1.2. Pro: [Right wing](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/02/18/we-need-to-stop-calling-it-political-correctness/) groups keep falsely insisting that PC is trying to [rename](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/08/winterval-modern-myth-christmas) Christmas.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.2. Pro: Being anti-PC has become a form of [virtue-signaling](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/anti-pc-is-political-correctness-for-the-right.html) in conservative politics.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.2.1. Pro: In the [comments](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2019/09/south-africa-burger-king-drops-ham-from-names-of-burgers-to-avoid-offending-muslims) of Hungry Jacks removing "ham" from "hamburger" people complain about virtue signalling, even though the decision was business.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.3. Pro: Charlie Kirk recently tweeted that Texas State University had voted to ban a conservative student group in an attack on free speech. The University issued [various statements](https://www.chronicle.com/article/students-ban-of/246097) saying it had not banned the group and no intention of doing so. Still, Kirk has made no attempt to remove, edit, correct, or clarify his false tweet.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4. Con: "Political Correctness" was not adopted from within a particular group, but is a term coined from without. By its nature, PC is not meant to be complimentary. Contrast this with the "Black Panthers", whose name is adopted to represent their [beliefs](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Panther-Party).
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.1. Pro: A Venn diagram based on usage of the term would necessarily include bad behaviors and speech as well as good. Adherents can't lay exclusive claim to the term as they did not themselves invent or originally coin the term. A definitional stalemate.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.2. Pro: When the enemy chooses the term and the term is unclear from the outset, it is a fool's errand to try and correct the enemy on their definition. It is better to set a good example and let history be the judge.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.2.1. Pro: The optimal advance is to defend a specific practice, policy or behavior. Racist speech is a terrible and shameful practice and should be fiercely opposed based on values, and not by saying it is "not PC". This grossly demeans and detracts from equality, equity, liberty and other values civilized societies were founded upon.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.2.1.1. Pro: If one believes strongly in [Canada's Bill C16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Act_to_amend_the_Canadian_Human_Rights_Act_and_the_Criminal_Code), for instance, it should be defended on merit and association to commonly held values such as equality and respect.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.2.1.2. Pro: If someone hears a racist joke, and they condemn it, the other person might say, "You're just being politically correct!". The optimal response might be to condemn the joke based on common values of dignity, equality and illustrate the way it erodes a free society, rather than try to enter into a debate on how PC includes moral behavior around race and equality.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.3. Pro: It could be argued that the term was a strawman from the beginning, designed to malign forces against political foes or imply that a politician was dissembling or lying for political motives.
1.1.1.2.6. Pro: Anything worth saying can be said in a non-insulting and non-stereotypical way.
1.1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Open dialogue may result in [offense or hurt feelings](https://hbr.org/2016/03/how-to-disagree-with-someone-more-powerful-than-you) due to strong disagreement, which is part of the process. However, free speech was never intended to protect outright hate speech. The spirit of "Open dialogue" and the "Marketplace of Ideas" can be preserved without resorting to attacks on people or identity groups.
1.1.1.2.6.2. Pro: The only example of non PC speech being useful in this thread is in a work of fiction that aims to highlight injustices by minorities. The use of non-PC language shows why it is wrong. \(To Kill a Mockingbird.\)
1.1.1.2.6.3. Con: It is practically true that men and women are, on average, [biologically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270278/) [different](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161011-do-men-and-women-really-have-different-personalities) across numerous measurements. It is not necessarily true to the trans experience or simply to the gender experience of others, and might be considered non-PC from a practical standpoint to assert this.
1.1.1.2.7. Pro: Many of the statements political correctness derides are based on stereotypes or prejudice.
1.1.1.2.7.1. Con: Opinions are the basis of individuals' search of truth. Stereotypes and prejudice should be relentlessly uncovered and not choked.
1.1.2. Con: Some claim that only those in power call for "civil" discourse, because the rules of politeness/civility are defined by the powerful, and they have the power to enforce those rules. [Incivility/vulgarity is useful \[link is NSFW\]](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/05/the-necessity-of-political-vulgarity) in eliminating some of that power through demeaning the powerful or making their position laughable.
1.1.3. Pro: Political correctness fosters a mood of respect toward others. Being respectful to others is not detrimental to society, but rather beneficial.
1.1.3.1. Con: Political correctness can foster a mood of anger and resentment among those who feel their ability to speak freely is being unfairly curtailed.
1.1.4. Con: Political correctness is a barrier to social change.
1.1.4.1. Pro: PC advocates are fooled into thinking the way they use words and enforce the use of words lets them affect change when they haven't.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Listening to the complaints of others about certain words is valuable in itself, it shows empathy and it helps, even if by a very small amount, the quality of life of the people who thought that word was excluding them.
1.1.4.2. Con: Political Correctness is crucial to the development of humane social norms, progress, and cultural mores. Destabilizing the status quo through a strong PC movement allows society to integrate better moral ideas into its value system over time.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Deviance from current norms is required for social progress. If excessive in some respects, society will correct over time, synthesizing the virtues of the new behaviors into an optimized moral philosophy. Strong opening moves are required to destabilize a status quo that privileges the powerful few.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: By definition political correctness establishes a 'correct norm' and one way or another reinforces it. Reinforcing a norm stifles discussion that deviates from that norm, thus slowing other social reform.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: The development of humane social norms, progress, and cultural mores pre-existed PC, so therefore cannot be described as crucial to the process.
1.1.4.2.4. Pro: Most politically incorrect speech stems from irrational sources - intuition and emotion. Over time they become obsolete, after making a lot of damage.
1.1.4.2.4.1. Pro: Using the n-word towards African Americans was [politically incorrect in the 1950s in the US](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/should-blacks-collect-racist-memorabilia/). Acknowledging that led to better integration of black American people is key to driving further social change.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1. Con: The n-word is [often used between young black people and is seeing increased usage among young white people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger#Intragroup_versus_intergroup_usage). Due to the fact that societal standards that caused the word to be taboo in the first place have disappeared causes the word to not hold any power anymore, the only reason why people don't use it more often is because of the taboo that has persisted until now.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The n-word still has immense power in 2018. It is used as a term of abuse to [demean and scare](https://www.theroot.com/illinois-man-arrested-for-hate-crime-after-yelling-raci-1826222679) those it is aimed at.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Anything can be considered inflammatory with the right tone of voice. So can racial slurs be used in a normal conversation without a a negative connotation.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Racial slurs can be discussed in a normal conversation without a negative connotation, but they are rarely used without negative connotation.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: While tone can make anything inflammatory, using that as an argument that inflammatory language shouldn't be 'managed' is problematic in that it argues that, since any word can be used as a weapon, words that are used almost exclusively as weapons can't be singled out.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The root problem isn't solved however, it's akin to swiping half of the problem under the rug and seeing if it makes it go away.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If you're saying that the root problem is that people have those racist beliefs to start with, then you're half right. Requiring the conversation to be rational and non-inflammatory doesn't automatically change their beliefs. But it does allow people to have rational conversations without having the conversations descend into polarized shouting matches.
1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: It forces people who want to be in that conversation to figure out how to re-frame their arguments, which can cause them to reconsider the root of their argument.
1.1.4.2.4.2. Con: Racism stems from irrational sources, "politically Incorrect speech" stems from not being a progressive liberal. PC speech divides and blinds as this debate illustrates.
1.1.4.2.5. Con: Individuals may be less likely to talk about social issues for fear of not being politically correct.
1.1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Many well intentioned people avoid conversations about inequality for [fear of saying the wrong thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/how-to-thoughtfully-talk-about-racial-inequality-with-your-coworkers.html).
1.1.4.2.5.2. Pro: Fixation on language can obscure one's intentions.
1.1.4.2.5.3. Con: Using sensitive language is integral to social change, as words are powerful tools of change.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Some [argue](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/09/how-modern-addiction-identity-politics-has-fractured-left) that PC language weakens the bonds between the lower classes by focusing on identity issues rather than class struggles.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: This assumes people can't be focused on identity issues and class struggles at the same time. Focusing on both of them seems the most rational option, as both issues are important.
1.1.4.4. Con: By repeating politically incorrect things that are false and racist, people start and continue believing in those things; [kids get educated with such bias](https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/kids-learn-racism-prejudice-from-parents/). That can create and perpetuate social bias such as discrimination, bullying and can even facilitate ethnic cleansing.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: If everyone is nicer to each other and uses no offensive words, as PC-proponents suggest, people won't feel as attacked, meaning they won't fight as hard for social change.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Political correctness is a tool of the status quo that diffuses societal pressure by minority groups, and thus suppresses meaningful societal change.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: The more racist, sexists, or problematic statements one is exposed to, the more people are aware of endemic societal problems.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This implies that a person encountering these statements will immediately identify them as symptoms of a problem in society. However, they might just accept these statements as normal and true, which is often the case if biased views and insults go uncommented. The more you hear something, the more likely you are to believe it.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A perceived lack of open racism has led some to [claims that racism no longer exists.](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2008/11/racism_is_dead.html)
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no proof that these people did not see racism because PC culture caused the people around them to hide their racism. It is just as likely that they never had to experience the consequences of racism because they live in homogenous communities where their prejudices are never challenged, preventing them from noticing them as prejudices and therefore believing they don't exist / are harmless.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: No matter how obvious racism is, someone will deny it.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Because there are more of the societal problems. If it were so few that people didn't notice, it means it wouldn't be as big of a problem.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: People who are politically correct often feel that they have done their part. Thus, political correctness is problematic, because it can become a substitute for meaningful changes to systemic issues.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3. Pro: Political correctness is a [tool of those in power](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-019-00094-4). It keeps various groups in society fighting over small issues, such as how something should be worded. This distracts them from tackling larger issues that would create meaningful changes in society.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Merely removing offensive terms can cool off minority outrage that would otherwise lead to change.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: The motivation behind social change is important too. Outrage isn't the only feeling that should drive us to change things.
1.1.4.4.1.3. Con: Outrage is not the only thing that can trigger change.
1.1.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Outrage is a powerful force for change.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Saying "such ethnic group is dirty" because of their skin color, or "stupid" because of the differences in their historic, civilization, technological and social systems can lead to cultural bias and impoverishment of that ethnic group even when there is no problem with their qualities as individuals and no problem with their communities. A lack of political correctness actually creates and perpetuates the problem.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: False statements should not be banned, but should be countered by true statements.
1.1.4.4.3.1. Con: If there is no one there to counter the argument, such as only children and the racist adults being around, there is nothing there to stop the children learning the bad habits.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Con: For most speeches in the media, a large audience might never hear the true statement which will reinforce racist speech. Racist speech should thus be removed from the stem.
1.1.4.4.3.3. Con: Hateful people don't respond to [facts](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/01/how-to-respond-to-a-racist-comment/).
1.1.4.5. Con: Political correctness is a good thing as it protects society from nefarious social change.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: Political correctness dulls society's sensitivity to outrage. [When everything is outrageous, nothing is](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/defining-memories/201607/compassion-fatigue-in-globalized-society). It blurs the line between what is harmful and what is merely tasteless or pointless.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Incidents such as [a governor who in his youth dressed up as blackface to a costume party](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/10/blackface-shows-how-deeply-rooted-antiblack-racism-america/2816801002/) , [a Nobel laureate who argued his entire life that black people are genetically inferior](https://www.euronews.com/2019/01/13/nobel-prize-winning-scientist-stripped-of-last-honorary-titles-over-racist-comments) , government authorities who [separate young children from their illegal immigrant parents](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-donald-trumps-administration-kids-separated-border-originally/story?id=60447930) and [law enforcement agents who shot a "good guy" with a gun](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/black-man-killed-alabama-mall-shooting.html) just because he was black triggered just about the same level of outrage.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: The "level of outrage" something causes is hard to define and highly subjective. It depends on which news outlets you follow and which incidents you remember more clearly because they happened close to you / relate to a personal experience. That everything causes the same level of outrage is not necessarily an accurate observation and difficult to verify.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The word "violence" used to have a meaning that most equated to physical harm, [it is now sometimes being used in relation to speech](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/). The concern in the parent may be that definition boundaries have become so inclusive that it makes it difficult to discern the severity and may result in a "crying wolf" effect or [catastrophizing](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-catastrophizing/).
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [In the United States, hate speech enjoys substantial protection under the First Amendment](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/hate) and this is one contributing factor to the perception of speech as violence. While hate speech may not be the same as physical violence, [it certainly can cause harm to its targets.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/opinion/sunday/when-is-speech-violence.html)
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The sited opinion piece equates speech with actual violence due to the shortening of telomeres from stress induced by hateful speech, but [Conservatives](https://nypost.com/2018/07/22/when-colleges-say-inclusive-what-they-really-mean-is-no-conservatives/) on [college](https://mic.com/articles/1024/conservatism-under-attack-on-college-campuses#.8kAzE9YHq) [campuses](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/22/us/conservative-activist-assault-uc-berkeley/index.html) are routinely [marginalized](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/conservative-liberal-college-campus/story?id=23443117) and occasionally threatened with [physical violence](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/red-alert-politics/conservative-attacked-on-uc-berkeley-campus-for-protesting-jussie-smolletts-hate-crime-hoax).
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Hate speech in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States) is not regulated, in contrast to that of most [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_5_Public_Order_Act_1986#The_offence) liberal democracies. In 2017, US justices [unanimously reaffirmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States) that there is effectively no "hate speech" exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: In US [Supreme Court case Brown v Board of Education](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=87), the court declared that African American children were [harmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_and_Mamie_Clark#Doll_experiments) by segregated schooling because it "generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community", and that this harm was an inequality that violated their constitutional rights.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The parent claim did not talk about broadening of definitions, but about a perceived "equal" level of negative public attention to certain events.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: A news outlet can show the same amount of people getting angry at two different events where one has many more people angered than others.
1.1.4.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.1.
1.1.4.5.1.1.2. Con: The positive perspective on this is that the more issues get public attention, the more issues get a chance to be resolved, especially those that would previously have been deemed too minor.
1.1.4.5.1.1.3. Con: News coverage does not constitute the entirety of public outrage. Some coverage is greater for some news over others.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Con: Though media often shows people getting outraged at something. This doesn't mean the thing people getting outraged at has anything to do with PC.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.1.1.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: Political correctness has a negative impact on society because it furthers the conflict between social groups.
1.1.4.5.3. Pro: In the 1930's in Germany; [Nazi media](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda) used antisemitic and racist tropes to push for passivity or support for the Nazi government killing of [6 million Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), and [500,000 Romanis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_genocide). Political correctness protects minorities from such things from happening again.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Pro: German media, newspaper and film [started depicting Jews](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda) as "subhuman" creatures, as wandering cultural parasites, consumed by sex and money, and finally "dangerous enemies of the German Reich" to lead the population acceptance of economic laws against German Jews, the removal of German Jews from government and universities, and finally ethnic cleansing of German Jews and then European Jews.
1.1.4.5.3.2. Pro: Propaganda [encouraged](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/nazi-propaganda-in-the-holocaust/) passivity and acceptance of the impending measures against Jews, as these appeared to depict the Nazi government as stepping in and “restoring order.”
1.1.4.5.3.3. Con: Political correctness may protect certain groups, but which groups get that protection is decided arbitrarily by society at large. The government just needs to manipulate the society through propaganda, and they can easily make a group "undesirable" group. Political Correctness will not protect those minorities.
1.1.4.5.3.3.1. Con: Governments are already manipulating society. [America](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/03/06/after-locking-migrant-children-cages-dhs-chief-tells-congress-theyre-not-cages) is doing it with Mexicans and [Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-21/asylum-seeker-on-manus-island-injuries-self-harm/11236040) with muslims. PC attempts to protect them from the propaganda.
1.1.4.5.3.4. Pro: Propaganda campaigns that depicted racist tropes [created an atmosphere tolerant of violence against Germans of Jewish descent](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda), particularly in 1935 \(before the Nuremberg Race Laws of September\) and in 1938 \(prior to the barrage of antisemitic economic legislation following Kristallnacht\).
1.1.4.6. Con: Any commonly accepted practice can act as a barrier to social change. That doesn't mean laws, social customs or religion are detrimental to society.
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: The fight for gay marriage faces barriers by commonly accepted [social and religious practices](https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/Attachments/final_malta_corrected.pdf), even though they have [law in their favor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage).
1.1.4.7. Pro: Political Correctness is patronizing to minority groups and insulting. It makes them feel weak and in need of protection.
1.1.4.7.1. Con: This may be true to the degree that PC sometimes overreaches its intent. It is [certainly not the case, however, that all minorities are opposed to attention given to greater awareness and empathy as far as the minority experience.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/microaggressions-matter/406090/)
1.1.4.7.2. Pro: Those who compose majority groups seldom understand all the needs of minority people, and thus any effort led by majorities to represent a minority are often incomplete.
1.1.4.7.3. Con: Stopping insults and slurs is not patronizing. When a majority engages in insults and slurs it is bullying. PC is about stopping bullying.
1.1.4.7.3.1. Con: The majority does not bully minorities with insults and slurs. The media exposes everyone they find who openly make such comments, and even then, there just aren't that many examples of it.
1.1.4.7.4. Con: This is not a fault of the concept itself, rather than a fault of the individual, who might transport the concept in a patronizing or insulting way. People can do bad for good reasons, that hasn't stopped us from abandoning good causes altogether.
1.1.4.7.5. Pro: [80%](https://www.businessinsider.com/political-unpopular-with-americans-all-ages-races-2018-10) of Americans think that political correctness is a problem. Minority groups, like Asians \(82%\), Hispanics \(87%\), and American Indians \(88%\) are [more likely](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) to oppose political correctness than white Americans \(79%\).
1.1.4.7.5.1. Con: According to [the same source,](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) African Americans are more likely to support Political Correctness than white Americans. Thus, the idea that all minority groups are more opposed to PC is unsupported by this source.
1.1.4.7.5.1.1. Con: Even if African Americans support PC slightly more than whites, 75% still don't.
1.1.4.7.6. Con: This argument dismisses the agency of minority groups. Privileged identity groups don't lead the conversation on what is and isn't politically correct. Minority groups decide what is offensive towards them, not the "superior identity group" or "ally." It's not about moral superiority. The original argument in question is only focusing on the "superior identity group."
1.1.4.7.6.1. Con: It does not dismiss -- it asserts the agency of minority groups. [Large minorities dislike Political Correctness.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) Privileged groups are leading the charge and posturing as though they are not. PC is like patriarchy -- a father or mother figure who wants to shepherd the flocks.
1.1.4.7.7. Con: When empowered majorities endeavor to support the goals of subordinate groups by taking the lead in societal change, the effort of that majority isn't harmful to the minority.
1.1.4.7.7.1. Pro: People with political clout can cause [change to occur more quickly](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193199) than those without such clout.
1.1.4.7.7.2. Pro: Majority people rarely, if ever, take the lead in putting forth a serious and unapologetic effort to represent minorities. If majorities tried to help minorities without internal opposition, they could implement comprehensive change.
1.1.4.7.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.2.
1.1.4.7.7.4. Pro: Psychological research tells us that most people are more comfortable among those that are similar to them; thus, may be more likely to listen and be moved by someone with a similar background. Individuals from a majority group can aid the marginalized by [confronting](https://diverseeducation.com/article/89078/) individuals within their own group \(the majority\) who are engaging in hate rhetoric, violence, etc against the marginalized.
1.1.4.7.7.5. Con: Marginalized groups can effectively move the majority.
1.1.4.7.7.5.1. Con: That minority groups can and have had the most successful movements does not mean that majority groups who advocate for minority groups are harmful.
1.1.4.7.7.5.1.1. Pro: Generally, majority groups have made no united or self-actuated effort to support minorities in their countries in the past, so the effectiveness of such activity is unknown.
1.1.4.7.7.5.2. Pro: [MLK Jr. moved the meter on racism in the US during the Civil Rights Movement](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement). He argued on platforms everyone agreed upon, dignity and liberty, rather than using divisive and exclusionary language. He was part of a minority group.
1.1.4.7.8. Pro: Instead of [White Guilt as a motivating force for PC](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/24/atonement-as-activism/), it may be time to research positions and actions that actually improve things in a deeply divided world.
1.1.5. Con: Civilized societies are based on enlightenment values [such as tolerance and intelligence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/), which should facilitate discussion regardless of mode or method, thus rendering PC unnecessary.
1.1.5.1. Con: Society is [not](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-shouting-in-politics-when-anger-trumps-argument) fully civilised, otherwise we wouldn't need PC.
1.1.5.2. Con: Some methods of communication are inherently uncivilised, such as shouting and making threats, and thus make poor models of communication irrespective of the level of societal civilisation.
1.1.5.3. Con: It is impossible to ensure and maintain the plurality of political discourse if the debate is not welcoming to all experiences. The aim of "political correctness" is to limit the suppression of marginalised groups, not to suppress conversations.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: If homophobic language is used openly in a discussion about gay marriage, it will not be a welcome space for homosexual's viewpoints.
1.1.6. Pro: Agreeing to PC ascription of labels is a way of defining society as tolerant and accepting.
1.1.6.1. Con: PC makes discussion about using the "correct" use of language rather than ideas.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The James Damore [Memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber) is a case in point.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Several scientists addressed Damore's memo and [pointed out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber#On_the_science) that "Damore failed to understand the research he cited".
1.1.6.1.2. Con: PC demands that people in a conversation be respectful enough of each other to have a conversation. Expressing ideas in a way that doesn't insult the other person is important if either person is ever going to be willing to change their viewpoint.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.6.2. Con: What is or is not PC in context of this discussion forms organically within society. No one person or group of people \(except the people as a whole\) can be said to decide what is or is not PC.
1.1.7. Con: This is not an argument for political correctness because it is a condition that is already satisfied in civilized societies where individual freedoms are balanced by prohibitions that produce harm.
1.1.8. Con: PC tries to remove the symptoms, not the causes, of some bad beliefs.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Political correctness is self-defeating. It strengthens the bigotry it tries to combat by covering it up without addressing its root causes.
1.1.8.1.1. Pro: Political correctness damages the interaction between different societal groups leading to greater segregation and increasing the marginalization of the groups' political correctness is designed to protect.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Political correctness puts a [constant mental load](https://au.reachout.com/articles/whats-the-deal-with-political-correctness) on people to assess how they behave around members of the marginalized groups to which it pertains. This may lead to people avoiding interactions with marginalized people altogether.
1.1.8.2. Pro: PC culture is actually detrimental to the groups it is supposed to protect. If it is not possible to discuss lack of education or a high rate of illiteracy in a group, then it is impossible to identify the reasons and help this group.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: PC culture does not seek to eliminate valid and factual criticism. It is possible to talk about illiteracy or other social issues in a group without perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: While this is true in principle, the reality is not true. For example, a dean had to step down because she wanted to help those ["who don’t fit our CMC mold."](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-claremont-marches-20151112-story.html) Even though her intent was to help people, this email triggered protests and hunger strikes. This is not criticism, this is mob rule.
1.1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: News coverage of such events is often exaggerated. For example, while news coverage of this event focused on the Nov 2015 "CMC mold" comment, the students' hunger strike and call for the dean's resignation was a last straw after what many saw as ["a lot of empty apologies"](https://youtu.be/LkWk19hEXbc?t=101). Students had been attempting since [at least Feb 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115013906/https://cmcforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FINALMarginalizedStudentArticle.pdf) to engage college staff about valid, factual criticisms dating back to 2013.
1.1.8.2.1.1.2. Con: The "CMC mold" quote reflects a deep lack of self-awareness and insensitivity. Universities do not exist to produce sheep, but to pass on cognitive tools to the next generation.
1.1.8.2.1.2. Pro: PC conversation is even more important when discussing issues that disproportionately affect marginalized groups, because majorities usually have the power to change a situation that minorities cannot.
1.1.8.2.1.2.1. Pro: Getting input from minorities about what to change and how is critical. Demonstrating good faith by being PC can improve dialogue.
1.1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.1.2.
1.1.8.3. Con: This is a [false dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma), both issues are important and both should be given attention.
1.1.8.4. Pro: Pretending to be civil, while retaining uncivil views, is unlikely to lead to more positive relations, if the underlying views are of resentment, intolerance or hatred, as the motivations will remain unchanged.
1.1.8.5. Con: Removing the symptoms of bad beliefs is better than doing nothing.
1.1.8.5.1. Con: If someone is being hateful, they should be able to be responded to appropriately.
1.1.8.5.1.1. Pro: A broadly accepted PC culture won't eliminate hate speech, because instead of allowing those bad ideas out in the open, and combatting them with better ideas, you're simply driving hate speech underground and making it part of the counterculture.
1.1.8.5.1.1.1. Con: The argument that forbidding something will not eradicate it but will cause people to do it in secret can be made for everything that is illegal or frowned upon. Yet we obviously do not stop making laws and rules because they represent moral values and ideals and as such do not need to be concerned with the possibility of people not abiding by them.
1.1.8.5.1.1.2. Pro: Having bad ideas out in the open and allowing for peer pressure and normative culture to shape them helps change people's minds when they learn from others and come to realize that their beliefs are in the small minority.
1.1.8.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: A person cannot realize their beliefs are extreme when those views are never openly challenged. In fact, it is very easy to withdraw into a social bubble where you don't have to face criticism for your words and thoughts, even on public platforms like social media.
1.1.8.5.1.1.3. Con: Trying to "combat hate with better ideas" is a futile endeavour, because irrational, violent hate cannot be countered with reason, be it verbal or physical. Most of the time, any reaction to the hate will just further provoke or validate the attacker.
1.1.8.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: Only very few people possess the ability to de-escalate such a situation effectively. Therefore, it would be a danger to allow such hate out in the open.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4. Con: The Nazis' ideas got out in the open where they could be combated. However, they got elected after that.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: Populist statements and viewpoints appeal to people's emotions, which is in direct conflict with rational thought. You cannot beat fear- or anger-based propaganda with logic.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: There have been popular [false accusations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness#False_accusations) of PC causing changes.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.2. Con: Comparing Germany, which was in a [complete state of disarray after the stock market crash](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/german-economic-miracle.asp) and the [effects of the Treaty of Versailles](https://www.history.com/news/treaty-of-versailles-world-war-ii-german-guilt-effects), with modern day western countries is a false equivalence.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.2.1. Con: [Modern western countries have been unsettled due to perceived poor economic conditions and majority reactions to racial and ethnic issues.](http://harvardpolitics.com/world/rise-of-far-right/) As a consequence, ethnocentric politics are increasingly attractive to westerners. This parallels conditions that led to the rise of Nazi Germany.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3. Pro: Unfortunately, allowing bigots to say whatever they like doesn't mean they can be 'defeated in verbal combat'. Often, the opposite is more the case.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.1. Con: If society cannot defeat a bigot in a fair debate, then it is time to change its approach. Shooting down ideas as patently unintelligent and provably uninformed as bigotry should be like shooting "fish in a barrel".
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.2. Con: You probably can't convince the bigot they're wrong, but you can show that their arguments have no basis in reality, which is convincing to any intelligent observer. A bigot only "wins in verbal combat" if no intelligent observer is present.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3. Pro: The nature of extremist and fanatic views is that [they are not easily changed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6414414/) by civil discourse, because the premises of such discourse are denied in the first place by way of using insults, stating facts without providing evidence, outright denying other positions without crafting a counter-argument, evading questions by acting hurt etc.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: It is true that it is difficult to change the mind of a fanatic. It is not, however, difficult to allow the fanatic to sell the opposite point of view to others through the obvious stupidity of this self-same fanatic. The great thing about fanatics is their lack of self-awareness. Put another way, idiotic ideas on clear display will sell a saner alternative. Stupidity has very few selling points for the average person, same with bigotry.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: Unhindered free speech would allow for hate speech.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Demagogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue) gain popularity in a democracy by exploiting prejudice among the common people.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Exposure to hate speech [increases people's prejudices](https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-hate-speech-boosts-bigotry-and-intolerance).
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Exposure to angry, hostile content targeting specific groups [increases](https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-hate-speech-boosts-bigotry-and-intolerance) people's prejudices. Providing a platform for hate speech increases bigotry.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.2. Con: Denying the premises of civil discourse does not create a convincing argument. You might not convince an irrational fanatic, but you will show the weakness of their ideas. Dismissing them fails to show the weakness of their ideas.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.4. Pro: Fanatics do not care what you can prove or debate: [engaging with them is how their views are popularised](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/5/18125507/milo-yiannopoulos-debt-no-platform). The objective is to not let disenfranchised, vulnerable people be radicalized into what appears to other people as completely ludicrous ideas.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.4.1. Con: The article discusses how censoring people can prevent them from spreading their ideas, and expresses the unsupported opinion that two people deserved censorship for being reactionary. It does not address the claim that engaging in reasoned debate with fanatics popularizes their views. Censorship does not differentiate good ideas from bad ones: debate does.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.4. Con: The Nazis’ ideas could emphatically not be openly challenged - due to some of the most extreme [political censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Nazi_Germany) of [free speech](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda-and-censorship) in history. This is a compelling lesson to not censor speech if ever one existed.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.4.1. Con: Political censorship by Nazis took place [after](https://www.ushmm.org/propaganda/timeline/1918-1932/) they were elected. It was the freedom of speech that got them elected.
1.1.8.5.1.1.4.4.2. Con: This is an irrelevant equivocation. It's completely disingenuous to draw an equivalence between the book burning and media control policies of the Nazis, and encouraging the use of politically correct language. The parent comment observed that they were elected on a platform where they could say whatever fascist, bigoted things they wanted.
1.1.8.5.1.1.5. Con: If acts of hate speech are performed in smaller groups they cannot develop their agitating potential.
1.1.8.5.1.1.5.1. Con: Small insular groups which are based around hate speech have the potential to become violent \(Ex: criminal/terrorist acts by small extremist groups such as [Atomwaffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomwaffen_Division#Criminal_charges)\).
1.1.8.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.3.3.
1.1.8.6. Pro: Political correctness prevents the public from sharing their concerns. This can lead to such circles operating "underground", becoming more isolated, [fanatical](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/38949/13Dec_Hug_Erin.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) and [dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/02/social-isolation-behind-extremism-and-terrorism-police-told) than the common person expressing their non-PC views.
1.1.8.7. Con: The use of PC is generally to create an inclusive, fair and respectful dialog. It is not used to change opinions or views but rather to open constructive lines of communication for all people.
1.1.8.8. Con: PC tries to remove one of the causes of bad beliefs, that is teaching people falsehoods in the first place.
1.1.8.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.1.8.8.2. Pro: One of the types of bad beliefs is [subconscious](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/02/unconscious-bias-what-is-it-and-can-it-be-eliminated) [racism](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/09/is-there-effective-way-fight-implicit-bias/571399/), which using politically correct language may help to prevent newer generations being taught.
1.1.8.9. Con: Ideas spread through speech and the symptoms of the idea is speech. In this case, if you remove the symptoms you fight the cause.
1.1.8.9.1. Con: Banning particular words and phrases does not fight the root of a bad idea. It pushes those forbidden words and phrases underground and the same ideas may then be presented using either new words, phrases and changing the definitions of words, referred to as "[dog-whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics)."
1.1.8.10. Pro: Political correctness masks the fact that good intentions are more important than proper words.
1.1.8.10.1. Con: Action with good intention can still have harmful consequences; political correctness is a proposed framework for turning good intentions into harm reduction.
1.1.8.10.1.1. Pro: Harmful consequences are sometimes more important than the intention behind the action. The marginalization or oppression of those around us makes the intention behind our actions [irrelevant](https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/07/intentions-dont-really-matter/).
1.1.8.10.2. Con: PC culture concerns itself with intentions rather than words.
1.1.8.10.2.1. Pro: An opinion can still be expressed without it becoming an insult or attack on others.
1.1.8.10.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.6.
1.1.8.10.2.2. Con: Not only do people suffer consequences of non-PC things said on accident, but their associates or family suffer as well.
1.1.8.10.2.2.1. Pro: People not even associated with Covington are being [doxxed and threatened](https://www.dailywire.com/news/42442/leftist-mob-wrongly-identifies-student-covington-emily-zanotti) for the actions of the students in Washington.
1.1.8.10.2.2.2. Pro: Conor Daly [lost his NASCAR sponsorship](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/sports/autoracing/conor-daly-nascar-racial-slur.html) over a slur made by his father years before he was born. His father never even repeated the slur when he learned what it meant in America.
1.1.8.10.2.3. Con: The point at which PC Culture stops concerning itself with words and focuses on intentions, like everyone else, it will cease to exist.
1.1.8.10.3. Pro: PC is designed to steer society away from the real issues, usually by fringe and vocal groupings. To call a thing by a nicer sounding name does mot make it a different thing.
1.1.8.10.4. Con: Assuming good intentions by default is not always advisable. People tend to be selfish and want to confirm their preexisting opinions. Pointing this out may lead to a discourse that has the potential to go beyond personal feelings.
1.1.8.10.5. Pro: Coercing or shaming people into being politically correct only changes their behavior, not their beliefs.
1.1.8.10.5.1. Con: The change in behavior is sometimes not to mechanically change their language into being PC, but because they feel a change of spirit that it makes them want to behave differently.
1.1.8.10.5.2. Pro: This won't solve the underlying problems in society, but will merely hide them and allow us to forget them.
1.1.8.10.5.2.1. Pro: PC culture hid the [rise of overtly discriminatory behavior in the US after the election of Trump](https://psmag.com/social-justice/trumps-election-made-bigotry-more-acceptable), but did nothing to fix it.
1.1.8.10.5.2.2. Con: If hate speech is hidden and we forget, we are less likely to pass discriminatory behaviour to the next generation, which will make it easier to fix.
1.1.8.10.5.3. Pro: The only place to discuss these issues for the shamed is in echo chambers of like-minded individuals.
1.1.8.10.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.6.
1.1.8.10.5.4. Con: Their behaviour, such as being racist, is a bigger problem than if someone kept their, for example, white supremacy to themselves.
1.1.8.10.5.4.1. Con: Most acts that are politically incorrect are not as [overtly destructive as white supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_genocide_conspiracy_theory).
1.1.8.10.5.4.2. Pro: Civilized society is a lot about suppressing your urges for the sake of others and ultimately your own. Humans will always have violent and hateful thoughts, but most of use have learned to exercise restraint to not actually become aggressive or violent.
1.1.8.10.6. Pro: PC culture can negate heading towards something good, due to [misunderstandings](https://isaacnewtonfarris.com/when-being-politically-correct-is-humanly-incorrect/).
1.1.8.10.7. Pro: PC culture can get in the way of understanding the past in order to examine and move away from it by preventing access to it \([1](https://www.lawliberty.org/2019/04/03/permanence-progress-political-correctness/)\) out of fear of hearing 'improper' material.
1.1.8.10.8. Con: If a person's intentions are pure and they do not wish to offend, it should not be a problem for them to educate themselves on how to present their thoughts in a compassionate and respectful way.
1.1.8.10.8.1. Con: Not wanting to offend can show that more thought is put into how an argument is presented rather than the argument itself. What, however, isn't true is that 'genuine interest' is synonymous with how you phrase a sentence. The two have nothing in common with one another.
1.1.8.10.8.2. Con: The word womxn may be sexist and [racist](https://www.dailywire.com/news/38924/we-should-say-womxn-not-women-be-inclusive-wait-no-ashe-schow) according to some, and the term womyn excludes [biological woman](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/10/womxn-row-companies-worry-word-women-excludes-transgender-people/). Replacing either of the words with [female](https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/why-you-should-stop-addressing-and-referring-to-women-a-1819180317) is also derogatory when used offensively. Even when a person genuinely tries to educate themselves, and greatly desires not to cause offense, it may be easy to do so inadvertently.
1.1.8.10.8.2.1. Con: 'Womxn' is [used regularly in academic literature,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C15&q=womxn&btnG=) including studies conducted [in Africa by African women.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03031853.2018.1549115).
1.1.8.10.8.2.2. Con: One can use the word "women" or "female" to refer to women without offending someone by using them in non-offensive ways.
1.1.8.10.8.2.3. Con: A generally accepted and widely used term is "female-identifying" or "identifying as female".
1.1.8.10.8.2.3.1. Con: These terms are generally accepted by those who use these terms to describe themselves as well as those close to these issues. They are respectful and worthy of inclusion into the mainstream lexicon, but awareness and usage of these terms in broader society lags behind and may lead to tension between groups.
1.1.8.10.8.2.3.2. Pro: While these terms may take time to gain traction across large diverse societies, the generally brief, relative to the scope of history, awkward integration period is typical of social progress.
1.1.8.10.9. Pro: People at one point could stop trying to help those who need help most because they are afraid to offend them, but cannot be PC in handling their circumstances.
1.1.8.10.9.1. Con: Because only bigots need to worry about being called out on being PC, people aren't going to make their choice to help underprivileged groups based on if they have someone to offend in it, but rather if they don't like the group they'd avoid it.
1.1.8.10.10. Con: Intent is difficult to convey outside of conduct and the words one uses, so using proper words helps convey good intentions.
1.1.8.10.10.1. Con: One should be charitable and forgiving while interpreting the words of others, and save condemnation for a time such that conduct confirms malicious intent or intent to harm.
1.1.8.10.10.1.1. Con: Being pro-PC and favoring the use of certain terminology does not automatically make you unforgiving. It is possible to politely inform people about the possible negative consequences or unintended meaning of their words.
1.1.8.10.10.2. Con: "Proper words" with the number of quickly growing taboos has become a minefield for those who may not have the social awareness, cosmopolitan outlook or verbal skills of a techno-denizen surfing the bleeding edge of the latest PC zeitgeist.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1. Pro: This is a calamity for those who do not use progressive left "[newspeak](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7688758?ec_carp=4034094105350062066)" either through ignorance or conscious disagreement with progressive ideas. A person from rural America may have difficulty deciding how to address a trans person or whether or not to open a door for a young female.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1.1. Con: In the case of true ignorance, most people saying non-PC things "on accident" will not suffer harsh consequences, since their ignorance is usually evident.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.10.2.2.2.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1.2. Con: Conscious disagreement is still possible with PC culture. PC is not about disallowing counter-arguments.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1.2.1. Pro: Having guidelines on speech doesn't automatically mean than anyone not following them is not allowed to speak anymore, ever. It just means their choice of words might be criticized.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1.3. Pro: There is an unfortunate mob mentality on social media that can lead to honest mistakes permanently scarring an individual's reputation.
1.1.8.10.10.2.1.3.1. Con: This might get people off of social media, which is a positive thing.\([1](http://www.ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_5_No_10_September_2014/18.pdf)\) \([2](https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=engl_176)\)
1.1.8.10.10.2.2. Con: If you are not familiar with the "latest global zeitgeist", other people's reactions to your statements should point you in the right direction. From there, it takes five minutes of Google, which is not asking a lot.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.1. Con: This assumes all this is even a good idea in the first place - and - further, that once decoded it will be seen to be true. Neither proposition is universally accepted. PC Culture has taken on ideas and language that, though they may contain seeds of compassion and truth, are opaque to many and worse, disguise many controversial ideas not accepted by science, philosophy or even within it's own cultural milieu.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.1.1. Con: "Once decoded it will be seen to be true" was not a statement or implication made by this claim. The statement was "if you want to enter a discussion about X, even if you don't know what it means, it is easy to find out." Whether you agree or not is a whole different thing.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.1.2. Pro: Feminism -- 1st wave, 2nd wave ...3rd wave etc. contain mutually incompatible and sometimes incomprehensible ideas. See [Martha Nussbaum's critique of Butle](https://philpapers.org/rec/NUSTPO-3)r.[See also Paglia's critiques of Butler.](http://www.bookslut.com/features/2005_04_005030.php)
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.2. Con: This implies that people should blindly follow PC culture, research to decipher the jargon, re-calibrate their moral meters to match, and align themselves to the PC viewpoints.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.2.1. Con: This is not at all the implication. The implication is that everyone can easily stay up-to-date with the "zeitgeist". This does not state any obligation to re-align moral values accordingly, it is just about being able to participate in the discussion and actually understand what is being criticized. Asking someone to try and understand is not necessarily asking them to agree.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.3. Pro: Repeat usage of language that others clearly find offensive suggests that the speaker's intentions are not, in fact, good.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.3.1. Con: One has nothing to do with the other. People can use socially unacceptable words in normal conversations and mean nothing by it.
1.1.8.10.10.2.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.8.10.10.3. Pro: In courts of law, the words that people have used are often put into [evidence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence-legal/) to prove intent.
1.1.8.10.10.4. Pro: With an increasing digital culture that communicates significantly through text, it is more important than ever to ensure that there is proper terminology to convey intent through text.
1.1.8.10.10.4.1. Con: The way that most teens and some adults have adapted to this is with the use of emoticons, they semi-perfectly encapsulate the intent without having to change the phrasing.
1.1.8.10.10.4.1.1. Con: Emoticons or emojis may be used [sarcastically](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/21/2/105/4065362).
1.1.8.10.11. Pro: PC is put ahead of safety to protect people.
1.1.8.10.11.1. Pro: In 2016, an apology was demanded and the magazine [Wings of China](https://news.sky.com/story/air-china-under-fire-for-racist-warning-on-london-minority-areas-10568958) was banned for publishing an article warning passengers, "London is generally a safe place to travel, however precautions are needed when entering areas mainly populated by Indians, Pakistanis and black people. We advise tourists not to go out alone at night, and females always to be accompanied by another person when traveling."
1.1.8.10.11.1.1. Con: The most crime-ridden borough in London, especially if you're a tourist, is [Westminster](https://www.churchillsecurity.co.uk/2019/01/09/top-10-dangerous-london-boroughs-updated-2019/), which seems to suggest that the magazine was putting racial prejudice ahead of safety.
1.1.8.10.11.1.1.1. Pro: Westminster's [ethnic makeup](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/westminster-population) is predominately "White British" or "Other White", with only 3.3% Indian,1.1% Pakistani, and 4.2% Black African.
1.1.8.10.12. Pro: PC results in mental health problems due to its focus on the words and language of an individual.
1.1.8.10.12.1. Pro: Political correctness hides our dark traits, lulling us into an illusion that we are alike or agree.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1. Pro: PC culture can act as a mask for hateful ideologies if the speaker uses the accepted phrases.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.1. Con: It's hugely disingenuous to say that the proponents of hateful ideologies are impossible to identify in a world where the use of bigoted language is denounced.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.2. Con: Any hateful ideologues can mask their ideas with a bit of intelligence and eloquence. The existence of baseline standards for politically acceptable language is not a determining factor.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.2.1. Pro: Insults and hate speech can easily be masked by claiming they were supposed to be funny or ironic or by outright denying what you've said \(as can be seen in politics\). Banning PC culture does not stop people from lying.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.3. Con: [The language we learn and use often shapes our mind](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-biolinguistic-turn/201702/how-the-language-we-speak-affects-the-way-we-think)- so those who would spout hateful ideology could turn away from that ideology because they are using different language that reshapes their mind.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.4. Con: Hateful ideologies tend to rely on specific language to get across their message, so using PC terminology would be counter-intuitive for their messengers.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.5. Pro: PC culture leads to people afraid of backlash hiding their actual beliefs. That's bad, because truly hateful people cannot be identified in such a world.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.5.1. Con: [People have already done this for decades.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shy_Tory_Factor) It is thus disingenuous to say that this is a problem with political correctness.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.6. Pro: So long as Nazis are willing to march in the streets \(Charlottesville\), they can be seen, spotted, and challenged/ridiculed/whatever. However, PC culture camouflages Nazis by "social ban", chasing them into the shadows, making hate ultimately harder to confront.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.6.1. Con: Nazis in the shadows pose less of a threat than Nazis getting elected.
1.1.8.10.12.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: An Australian Senator, [Fraser Anning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Anning), was elected with just 19 votes and would still be unpopular except he used a term from the Nazi party, "Final solution", during a [speech](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/full-text-senator-fraser-anning-s-maiden-speech) that apparently praised the white Australia policy.
1.1.8.10.12.2. Pro: Political correctness, instead of generating positive debate that leads to better outcomes, attempts '[psychological manipulation](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/08/10737/)' to attack words to get their way instead of looking at the bigger picture.
1.1.8.10.12.3. Pro: Political correctness [promotes anxiety](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2015/02/11/anxious-sensitivity) in people who are too worried to speak about identity related issues for fear of being labeled a bigot.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1. Pro: PC is psychologically [traumatizing](https://psychologydictionary.org/trauma/) to those who want to freely think and collaborate with people benevolently \(they worry about accidentally offending and distressing the ones they're with\); they become [afraid to do anything](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-05-19/politically-correct-culture-doesnt-let-college-students-learn-from-pain), causing them to "freeze up" \(which leads to self-censorship\) instead of having positive thought and action.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.1. Con: There is hardly any free speech supressed by PC. The ideas can as easily expressed in a different way.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: There is hardly any free speech suppressed by PC because it is limited to offensive things like sexism, racism, etc. These things are never used by a lot of people, and of those who do, few revolve their life around being offensive.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.1.2. Pro: Instead of being offensive, people could quote statistics to support the claim they are making.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.1.2.1. Con: [Facts](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds) do not [change minds](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds).
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Presenting someone with facts will not only [not persuade them but will likely strengthen the very belief](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/) one hopes to disabuse them of.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Beliefs and convictions are [grounded in group identity](https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/cohen_chap_hanson.pdf), not facts. ["It Is Useless To Attempt To Reason A Man Out Of A Thing He Was Never Reasoned Into."](https://thinkprogress.org/todays-quote-via-jonathan-swift-it-is-useless-to-attempt-to-reason-a-man-out-of-a-thing-he-was-never-452cdec80502/) - J. Swift
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.2. Pro: Part of this is due to [hypersensitivity](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/24/the-state-of-the-campus-and-womens-self-censorship/) that leads to negative consequences, that react to by being afraid to speak because of its existence.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.3. Con: Only bigots need to be afraid, bigots are simply scared of being pointed out as such.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.3.1. Pro: It's hard to accidentally be offensive. If someone doesn't use derogatory terms away from someone they might offend, they have no reason to accidentally use it when near someone it might offend. And if they do use the term, then they are a bigot even if the people don't hear it.
1.1.8.10.12.3.1.3.2. Con: Whom is a bigot and whom is not is subjective and depends on one's viewpoint.
1.1.8.10.12.3.2. Pro: ["Uncertainty](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38092550_It_Does_Not_Have_To_Be_Uncomfortable_The_Role_of_Behavioral_Scripts_in_Black-White_Interracial_Interactions) often leads members of dominant social groups \(e.g., White Americans\) to fear making inappropriate remarks or revealing latent prejudice during encounters with outgroup members \(e.g., Black Americans\)."
1.1.8.10.12.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.10.12.3.1.3.
1.1.8.10.12.3.3. Con: [This kind of anxiety can happen with any "outgroup"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergroup_anxiety) -- any group whose norms one is not familiar with. It is not an effect of PC.
1.1.8.10.12.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.8.10.12.3.1.3.
1.1.8.11. Pro: Instead of genuinely educating people on discrimination or violence of any kind, PC institutions only [constrain people to stop using \(or rather use\) certain terms](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/455713.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A13585337ae69ef0b16874c85d6208d9f). Without understanding the root, the true meaning and the power of these words, historically privileged groups see this initiative rather as a diminution of their free speech.
1.1.8.12. Pro: Political correctness treats the symptoms of discrimination towards minorities, but doesn't deal with the underlying causes. It fails to create change while lending the appearance of change.
1.1.8.12.1. Con: Most proponents of PC assert that "bad" terminology helps to maintain cultural systems that oppress minorities. Thus, changing the language is one of many steps toward stopping these oppressive systems. Proponents of PC believe using PC is a "why" and a "how" in and of itself.
1.1.8.12.1.1. Con: If it reasserts something, then it fundamentally is something tangential to the actual issue. Changing the language before changing the system creating the issue will fail to create any true change.
1.1.8.12.2. Pro: It is self evident that actions preventing groups or individuals becoming outcast is more important than actions preventing feelings of being outcast. PC culture addresses the latter instead of or over the former.
1.1.8.12.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.3.
1.1.8.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.9.3.
1.1.8.12.3. Con: Making murder illegal doesn't deal with the underlying causes that influence people to murder others. But outlawing murder is certainly necessary if we want less people to be killed. This an example that sometimes treating the symptoms, and not underlying causes, is a protection in itself.
1.1.8.12.4. Pro: Phrasing it as "political correctness" is similar to "tolerance" campaigns that are arguing for a good result, but use terms that [reinforce harmful assumptions](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/tolerance-implies-youre-having-to-put-up-with-something-bad-8570534.html). If the argument was about kindness or [respect](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/book/export/html/8766), it would be a more unambiguous goal.
1.1.8.12.5. Pro: PC culture protects minorities and those who feel outcast in the public culture, but does nothing to help them move up from their disadvantaged place in society. This keeps them safe and in their place. It does nothing practical to help the disadvantaged.
1.1.8.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.12.1.
1.1.8.12.6. Pro: A society in which racist and prejudicial speech is either legislated against, or made taboo, fails to address the underlying causes or continued existence of racism and prejudice, and may conceivably impede or prevent necessary socio-cultural confrontations of the material conditions which propagate prejudices.
1.1.8.12.6.1. Pro: Germany [banned](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/16/16152088/nazi-swastikas-germany-charlottesville) the swastika and other Nazi imagery after WWII, yet Neo-Nazism perpetuated itself via the coding of symbolism. Inter-generational conversations about Nazism were so laden with shame that the topic was and is largely avoided within families.
1.1.8.12.7. Con: Change is created by education and rational conversation. Education and rational conversation are much more likely to occur in environments where polarizing and inflammatory language is minimized.
1.1.8.12.7.1. Con: One has to be in contact with polarizing and inflammatory speech to rationalize a statement with those things as center points.
1.1.9. Pro: Political correctness tries to provide us with a means of establishing more informed beliefs independent of cultural bias.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Political correctness informs us about the origin of the words we use when describing subordinate groups, especially that some words stem from the assumption that one group is superior to others.
1.1.9.2. Con: Modern PC culture already has inherent bias for certain groups and against others.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: Even if something is only considered not PC when it targets a disadvantaged group, if someone is being offensive, clearly the group they are offending is disadvantaged in that scenario. Therefore, even in a white dominated country, it is non-PC to be racist against whites.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: Modern PC culture is contextual. It's being implemented to try and create a safe place for minorities who have a history of being persecuted. For certain groups, which are not a minority and don't face systematic oppression, those same rules don't always apply.
1.1.9.2.3. Pro: It is currently more PC to say something like 'I hate white men' than if the gender and races were reversed, rather than it be simply unacceptable to say something like that about anyone.
1.1.9.3. Pro: One of the main points of PC is to listen to a group of people when they complain about systemic and cultural oppressions. Listening to a diversity of voices is a good strategy to avoid cultural biases.
1.1.9.4. Con: No amount of political correctness educates or informs a person; only a learning environment can provide that.
1.1.9.4.1. Con: Political correctness talks about concepts like discrimination, systemic oppression or cultural bias, concepts that usually cause informative discussions.
1.1.9.4.2. Con: Humans learn [constantly](http://www.personalitydevelopment.org/levels-of-human-learning.html). Having a designated learning environment may not be necessary.
1.1.9.4.3. Con: Society can become a learning environment through political correctness.
1.1.9.4.3.1. Pro: Without political correctness, people will learn the [wrong](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/tucker-carlson-ilhan-omar-immigration-racist-lies-debunked.html) things in society.
1.1.9.4.3.2. Pro: People learn from their [environment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40561-018-0075-9).
1.1.9.4.3.2.1. Pro: In a hostile speech environment, members of marginalized groups learn that society does not value them. If they internalize this negative speech, it may affect their not only their self-worth but their ability to function in society.
1.1.9.5. Pro: Granting access to marginalized voices and analyzing how arguments rely on cultural biasses challenges us to make more conscientious and rigorous arguments.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: In [Western countries](https://theconversation.com/political-correctness-its-origins-and-the-backlash-against-it-46862) where PC is quite prevalent, marginalized people [already have a platform to talk on](https://iknowpolitics.org/sites/default/files/overcoming-political-exclusion-strategies-for-marginalized-groups-to-successfully-engage-in-political-decision-making-pdf.pdf).
1.1.9.5.2. Con: As political correctness has swept much of society with the goal of 'protecting the marginalized', ironically it has marginalized those with dissenting views by imposing a de facto 'speech control' on them.
1.1.9.6. Con: PC culture is cultural bias in and of itself.
1.1.9.6.1. Con: Political correctness is the the attempt to mitigate already existing biases by limiting language to a more bias-free domain. If no biases existed, political correctness wouldn't need to do this.
1.1.9.6.1.1. Con: In practical terms, there is no historical or empirical basis for eliminating biases. Human psychology is biased by evolutionary necessity and there is no reason to anticipate eliminating them. A far better approach is to recognize biases but emphasize critical thinking and to accept and work through cultural differences.
1.1.9.6.1.1.1. Pro: It is not possible to think or speak without a cultural bias. Every one of us has their own unique cultural background, which is the framework within which our thoughts and ideas are formed. To claim one can think without a cultural bias is akin to saying one can speak without a language.
1.1.9.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Even an open-minded person, willing to step out of their original cultural upbringing, is unable to include cultural elements of cultures they are unacquainted with. Thus, everyone has a cultural bias based on what they experienced and what they did not.
1.1.9.6.2. Con: This is not a distinguishing feature of PC culture. Any group, or set of ideas could be criticized in this fashion and therefore, no group should be singled out for this.
1.1.9.6.3. Pro: We are all biased and culture further informs our biases. Biases are the interplay between natural individual personality and the environment in which we reside.
1.1.9.6.4. Pro: PC is a set of [beliefs which inform our values](http://www2.bakersfieldcollege.edu/jgiertz/many_beliefs_form_values_which_s.htm). Cultural biases come from values. Political Correctness values fairness or equity over other values in society and is thus biased based on which values are dominant in a given context.
1.1.9.6.5. Con: Having inherent biases \(which every idea or collection from ideas have\) is not a reason to claim that PC can’t be an attempt to mitigate these cultural biases.
1.1.9.6.6. Pro: There are ideas and seeds of truth as well as good people in the PC movement, but the overall progressive movement is defective and marred by the bad actors. They are unwittingly campaigning for Trump as [80% of the US think PC Culture is a problem.](https://reason.com/blog/2018/10/11/political-correctness-americans-vote-maj).
1.1.9.6.6.1. Con: We judge ideas, not people. Bad actors are on every side, but that does not invalidate the idea.
1.1.9.6.6.1.1. Con: PC culture is a combination of people and ideas. Decoupling these ideas and assessing them separately is a timely and important task because there are great ideas in PC Culture that are maimed by their expression within PC culture.
1.1.9.7. Pro: [The language](https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think?utm_campaign=social&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_content=talk&utm_term=social-science) we use helps to shape the way we view the world.
1.1.9.7.1. Pro: Language plays a key role in perception. Some terms and expressions are linked to emotions of hate or disgust that severely taint the objective perception of others, which can be tackled using a moderate amount of PC culture.
1.1.9.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.
1.1.9.7.1.2. Pro: Historically, these terms were used to [desensitize people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522002/) towards discrimination or aggression against marginalized groups. Thus the need to tackle such historical biases.
1.1.9.7.2. Con: This is true, but it could shape the world in a way that excludes honest thought or hard facts even though they are true yet unpleasant.
1.1.10. Pro: Political correctness is like many ideals in society has essentially positive goals, which can be taken to negative extremes. While these extremes must be avoided, this does not mean that the ideal itself should be done away with.
1.1.10.1. Pro: All societies have implicit and explicit norms bounding what kinds of behavior and speech are acceptable or favorable and which aren't. Politically correctness is an attempt to correct the role which prejudice has, and continues to have, in warping these norms, to make society more open and hospitable for all.
1.1.10.2. Pro: PC is only detrimental to society if it is enforced with such authority that it completely ignores and prohibits the original intention of the notion of free speech. Depending on certain environments, political correctness is needed for a civil and rational interaction, PC isn't minimising the original intention of free speech at the moment.
1.1.11. Con: In a civilised society, there will be a proper level of politeness, which is not the same as political correctness. Political correctness is a perverted substitution for politeness. One can dismiss another person vulgarly, or be just as confrontational using entirely polite expressions. Political correctness would prevent either mode of expression.
1.1.11.1. Con: This difference between politeness and political correctness is a value judgement. One could just as easily argue that political correctness is simply a contestation of what should be considered polite by a society. What is polite is not an inherent truth but a social construct/social norm, and social constructs/norms are subject to transformation over time.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: It is true that social norms change over time. "Political Correctness" is a term designed to capture the point at which the overall utility is lost and a movement forms. Tribal behaviors are observed and "out-groups" are defined. The point at which this happens is indeed up for grabs.
1.1.12. Con: A culture of political correctness paves the way for authoritarianism.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Authoritarianism begins with a small educated minority who believe they know what's best for everyone. PC culture is that minority.
1.1.12.1.1. Con: This is not a unique characteristic of authoritarianism. The same can be said for the beginnings of democracy in America with the “founding fathers”.
1.1.12.1.2. Con: Authoritarianism [does not depend on education](http://www.preservearticles.com/2014071933479/12-important-features-of-authoritarianism-explained.html).
1.1.12.1.2.1. Pro: [Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista) was the authoritarian ruler of Cuba from 1952 to 1959. He [had very little education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista#Early_life).
1.1.12.2. Con: Political correctness does not censor critique of the government.
1.1.12.2.1. Pro: Political Correctness is too busy trying to censor the speech of the bulk of regular citizens to concern itself with critiques of the government.
1.1.12.2.2. Con: Once a government is given power to restrict the speech of individuals that meet certain criteria, the ability to restrict speech falls to the hands of those evaluating these criteria. The people evaluating the criteria may not have sufficient oversight, and could then use the power to restrict speech in a way unintended by the original restriction.
1.1.12.2.2.1. Con: Laws can be made with specificity, defining criteria clearly enough that they may not be purposefully misinterpreted by bad actors.
1.1.12.2.3. Pro: Political correctness is not a movement in support of the government enforcing certain speech, though it may include official government documents using PC terms and supporting political candidates who use PC terms while adhering to the underlying point of PC culture.
1.1.12.2.3.1. Con: There are many instances where activists have called upon government to enforce PC speech.
1.1.12.2.3.1.1. Pro: [A bill](https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=8269852&Language=E&Mode=1) was passed in Canada that could potentially lead people to be charged for ''hate crime'' if they used the wrong [pronoun](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/questions-and-answers-about-gender-identity-and-pronouns).
1.1.12.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Bill C16 does not require people to use genderless \(or preferred\) pronouns. The Canadian Bar Association wrote a [detailed review](http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/856-e.htm) which noted that the bill does not pose any risk to freedom of expression. The sole misuse of pronouns is not enough; other conditions must be legally present in order to convict someone.
1.1.12.2.3.1.1.2. Con: According to the aforementioned [source](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/questions-and-answers-about-gender-identity-and-pronouns), this only applies "when it takes place in a social area covered by the Code, including employment, housing and services like education", and only cases of "purposely" misgendering people. This does not apply to private conversations nor to accidentally using the wrong pronoun, but to explicitly targeted misgendering, which could be classified as motivated by hate or intolerance.
1.1.12.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: It could be classified as such, but does not expressly mean that it is motivated by hate or intolerance in all cases.
1.1.12.2.3.1.2. Pro: School districts have [banned](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-banned-740145) classic books for containing the n-word.
1.1.12.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Schools are a special case for children, and children are often protected and do not enjoy the full rights and responsibilities of an adult. Freedom of speech is a right for adults, and unless the books are banned in the regular public, there is no limit of freedom of speech.
1.1.12.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been [banned](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-banned-740145) because of racist references towards Jim and other African American characters in the book.
1.1.12.2.3.1.2.3. Pro: Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, a book about racism in the United States, has been [banned from many schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/07/a-school-district-drops-to-kill-a-mockingbird-and-huckleberry-finn-over-use-of-the-n-word/).
1.1.12.2.3.1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.6.2.
1.1.12.3. Con: There are many contributors to authoritarianism; political correctness does not carry that full load.
1.1.12.3.1. Pro: Other factors are needed to bring about authoritarianism, such as "[freedom to create opposition political parties or other alternative political groupings with which to compete for power with the ruling group is either limited or nonexistent in authoritarian regimes.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/authoritarianism)."
1.1.12.3.2. Con: It is a branch on the tree of authoritarianism. [PC authoritarianism happens on both conservative and liberal sides and is associated with the agreeableness trait.](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/75755)
1.1.12.4. Con: A good law should not be prevented from being put in place for fear of bad ones. It being determined that 'speech causing harm \(such as mental or opportunistic\) should be minimized' does not set a precedent for limiting speech in other ways.
1.1.12.5. Pro: Whoever would have the authority to determine what is politically correct would have far too much power.
1.1.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.1.12.5.2. Con: Even those who rail against the idea of PC itself are in fact exerting their influence to shift general ideologies on what political expressions should be considered acceptable. If successful, this will not do away with the concept but instead simply redefine what is considered PC.
1.1.12.5.3. Con: Political correctness works by creating norms about what can and can't be said, rather than by a governing body that bans free speech. It's likened to taboo 'curse' words- legal, but socially and culturally admonished.
1.1.12.6. Con: Authoritarianism is not necessarily always bad, as some alternatives - such as lawlessness - may be worse.
1.1.12.6.1. Con: Even if this is true, it is not relevant to discussions of PC. PC does not lead to lawlessness.
1.1.12.6.2. Pro: According to Hobbes, the most tyrannical government is worth serving if the alternative is the suffering brought about through instability and a lack of government. Famously describing life in what he called 'the state of nature' as: [''...nasty, brutish, and short''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_\(Hobbes_book\))
1.1.12.6.3. Con: Authoritarianism can't be validated as a good option by the existence of a worse option. Such logic could lead to statements such as "racism today is not necessarily always bad because slavery was worse".
1.1.12.7. Pro: If the government becomes the arbiter of what's considered "correct speech", it will use that power for self-preservation, as authoritarian governments have throughout history.
1.1.12.7.1. Con: This is a ['slippery slope' argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) based on a non-sequitur fallacy. This has never come about as a result of widespread public demand for the normalisation of inoffensive language, which is what political correctness is.
1.1.12.7.2. Con: Neither is Political Correctness enforced by the government, nor should it be. It's nothing more than a social contract that is in itself subject to public discourse.
1.1.12.7.2.1. Con: A diplomatic government is still created and shaped by its citizens, the more those citizens are themselves shaped by an ideology \(such as political correctness\), the more said government will subsequently begin to be shaped by that same ideology.
1.1.12.7.2.1.1. Con: This is a quirk of democracy that is better framed by a discussion around [The tyranny of the majority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority). It is true of any dominant ideology and says nothing about political correctness.
1.1.12.7.2.1.2. Pro: It's not that political correctness is directly enforced by the government, it's more that we demand it of our government, which in turn begins to gradually demand it of us.
1.1.12.7.3. Pro: China is an example of speech policy where the government [monitors](https://www.dw.com/en/hello-big-brother-how-china-controls-its-citizens-through-social-media/a-38243388) Chinese social networks and [punishes](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-is-watching-its-citizens-in-a-modern-surveillance-state-2018-4?IR=T#9-tracking-peoples-social-media-posts-which-can-be-linked-to-the-users-family-and-location-10) people for not speaking in the official line.
1.1.12.7.3.1. Con: Authoritarian censorship seeks to maintain an already established authority. Authoritarian regimes do this after they are in power, meaning it does not apply to PC.
1.1.12.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.4.4.1.
1.1.12.8. Con: Unhindered free speech leads to the rising of popular [demagogues who feed on hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue), and start [censoring dissenting views once in power](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/01/04/in-its-first-year-the-trump-administration-has-reduced-public-information-online/). A mild PC culture can stop the propagation of hate.
1.1.12.8.1. Con: PC is a minority position which is mostly composed of the educated elite demographics. A minority trying to get the majority to submit to its unwanted ideology is authoritarian.
1.1.12.8.1.1. Con: More people would support political correctness if they had better resources and education.
1.1.12.8.1.1.1. Pro: Progressive Activists [have the highest education and resources](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a70a7c3010027736a22740f/t/5bbcea6b7817f7bf7342b718/1539107467397/hidden_tribes_report-2.pdf), which allows them to devote attention to social issues. As compared to this, other groups such as the politically disengaged, have both lower resources and education which reduces their capability to have a take on injustices around them. \(p. 14, 30, 42\)
1.1.12.8.1.1.1.1. Con: This may also correlate with the sense that this group, though well-meaning, may also be out-of-touch with the experiences, beliefs and desires of the poor, uneducated and minority groups they hope to reach.
1.1.12.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: They belong to a group which is [more likely](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/can_your_politics_predict_how_empathic_you_are) to be empathic.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2. Con: Political correctness distorts the social sciences by contributing to the erasure of inconvenient truths.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Conflict theory, or Marxism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-theory.asp), states that society is dominated by a class of bourgeois. In the opinion of many political correctness advocates, however, the source of social discord is a general disposition among white people to repress other races.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The failure of Marxism in [predicting a social revolution](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/02/05/marx-wrong-global-revolution/), as well as its [outdated structure](https://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2017/12/a-right-side-to-history-the-failure-of-marxs-predictions-about-capitalism-part-2/) describing the power of individual capitalists, signals the need to reconsider the theory. That white people are the cause of inequality is a more apt source of the conflict described by Marx.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [White people colonized many continents on Earth](https://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5835320/map-in-the-whole-world-only-these-five-countries-escaped-european) and subjected the natives of every inhabited land to capitalist domination.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: White people are not unique in colonial domination.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Arabs [colonized](http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/book/islam-9780195107999/islam-9780195107999-chapter-13) Africa and South East Asia.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: White people colonized Asia by setting up [trading companies](https://dailyhistory.org/Why_was_Britain_able_to_establish_an_Empire_in_India%3F) and government regimes that exploited people in what are now the nations of India, Vietnam, Indonesia, China, and others.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: White people [colonized Africa](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44741772). The British Empire [controlled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) much of that continent by the end of World War I.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: [Only white nations have staked colonial claims in Anartica.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_claims_in_Antarctica). These claims [might lead to future conflicts with non-white nations such as China.](https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/the-future-of-antarctica-conflict-or-consensus/)
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.2. Con: One does not need to be a professional sociologist to develop social theories.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.2.1. Con: One must follow the scientific method to [develop theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method).
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: An individual needs to understand the field of study to some extent to come up with at least plausible hypothesis.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.2.2. Con: With no professional competence, very few will be taken seriously.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.2.3. Con: Sociology [revolves around](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/sociology/the-sociological-perspective/three-major-perspectives-in-sociology) the perspectives of conflict, functionalism, and symbolic interactionism. Considerations outside these perspectives are generally not considered sociology. Therefore, homegrown hypotheses which are outside those accepted theories are not sociology.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.2.4. Pro: There is no reason one would need to be a trained sociology to research, for example, conflict in a scientific manner.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.3. Pro: Multiculturalism, which encompasses political correctness, [is a political philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/) and not a sociological theory.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.4. Con: There is [debate](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/humanities-arent-a-science-stop-treating-them-like-one/) over whether or not sociology and other related disciplines are [scientific](https://revisesociology.com/2017/01/15/is-sociology-a-science/).
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.5. Con: It is often scientists - not politicians or lay people - who advocate for a change in terminology to change how the general public perceives a certain group of people.
1.1.12.8.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Scientific communities advocate for the use of [person-first language](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/disability) to avoid marginalizing communities that have been victimized by bias and prejudice for centuries.
1.1.12.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.
1.1.12.8.3. Con: This conflates "traditional liberal values" with PC Culture and the Social Justice Movement. Traditional liberal values are fully up to the task of saving us from demagogues but these values require work and civil discourse to work properly. Censoring speech fans the flames of discontent, fear, distrust and suspicion --- which are far more fertile breeding grounds for demagogues.
1.1.12.9. Pro: Political correctness leads to a [backlash](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/30/politics/donald-trump-hate-speech-anti-semitism-steve-king-kevin-mccarthy/index.html) by authoritarians.
1.1.12.9.1. Con: There is nothing here to prove that PC causes authoritarian backlash. Instead, this is likely an example of [Demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue).
1.1.12.9.2. Pro: It is an opinion held by some that [populism in the West is the backlash to political correctness.](https://torontosun.com/2017/02/25/the-backlash-to-political-correctness-was-inevitable/wcm/af5a0334-273c-4d97-ae3e-58d4f0b976be) Examples often given in support are of the [Trump administration](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2018/02/28/how-a-cultural-revolt-against-political-correctness-helped-launch-trump-into-the-presidency/) and [Brexit](http://threeworlds.campaignstrategy.org/?p=2191).
1.1.12.9.3. Pro: The greater the taboo of offensive speech, the greater the public prominence, fame, and power available to those willing to exploit the notoriety gained by provoking outrage.
1.1.12.9.3.1. Pro: Incivility is sometimes seen as attractive by extremities of the public.
1.1.12.9.3.1.1. Pro: A study [showed](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/when-lying-demagogue-authentic-candidate) that if there is a crisis, subjects who identify with the aggrieved social category \(outsiders if it’s a representation crisis; former establishment if it’s a power-devaluation crisis\) will see a lying demagogue as authentically appealing.
1.1.12.9.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.12.9.3.1.3. Pro: While Americans tell pollsters they dislike outrageous and offensive speech, 47 million people tune in daily to [outrage-based media](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/angry-politics-americans-addicted-101735), which encourages hosts and bloggers to court controversy as a way of generating higher ratings.
1.1.12.9.4. Con: This is actually a good thing, as when authoritarians are marking themselves out as uncivil and unwilling to participate in political discussion by the rules, they make themselves unpalatable.
1.1.12.9.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.2.1.
1.1.12.9.4.2. Con: "Marking themselves out as uncivil and unwilling to participate in political discussion by the rules" happens on both sides. The social justice movement is guilty of this as is the milder PC crowd.
1.1.12.10. Con: This is a [slippery slope argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) - a known logical fallacy. It has not happened before.
1.1.12.11. Pro: Punishing people without a crime creates a dangerous society.
1.1.12.12. Con: While authoritarian regimes do censor communication which undermines their authority, their censorship is focused on maintaining power. Even if political correctness caused censorship, it could not lead to authoritarianism.
1.1.12.12.1. Pro: [Political correctness is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) "avoiding language... that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting... people considered disadvantaged…". Because political correctness serves the marginalized and disadvantaged, it cannot be a tool of authoritarian regimes which are in power.
1.1.12.12.1.1. Con: [Political Correctness is linked with authoritarian personality types.](https://bigthink.com/stephen-johnson/the-2-main-personality-types-of-the-politically-correct)
1.1.12.12.1.1.1. Con: 'Authoritiarian personality types' are a class of personality in sociology and psychology which relates to the acceptance of traditional values and the avoidance of new ideas, and is not related to authoritarian government.
1.1.12.13. Con: Insulting people based on race is the path to authoritarianism.
1.1.12.13.1. Pro: Antisemitism played a large [role](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/why-did-hitler-hate-jews/) in the development and execution of Nazi ideology.
1.1.12.13.2. Con: Conflating racism with views counter to PC is the path to a non sequitur sprinkled with straw-men. [Many minorities are, themselves, not PC](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/).
1.1.12.13.2.1. Con: This disregards individuality. Within minority groups, there is disagreement over whether PC terms should be used, over what PC terms should be used, and on what grounds the use of those PC terms is based.
1.1.12.13.3. Pro: Categorizing people using language which is racist or which otherwise descends from an ethnocentric world view helps prolong or increase the subjugation of minorities.
1.1.12.13.4. Con: It's the racist ideas that are despicable in themselves. By policing the speech, you only dissimulate their thoughts, not fix them.
1.1.13. Pro: Political Correctness provides a structure for polite discussion of incendiary topics in a manner that stretches across socially constructed boundaries.
1.1.13.1. Pro: In a toxic psychological environment, a bad marriage or, in the case of racism, policies enforcing politeness, whether sincere or not, may stabilize the relationships enough to enable communication.
1.1.14. Con: A civilized society wouldn't exclude a whole section of its population based on linguistic etiquette.
1.1.15. Con: Citizens aren't required to be polite, they are only required to obey the law.
1.1.15.1. Con: The law can require citizens to use or not use certain politically incorrect terms \(e.g., outdated terms used to refer to those with disabilities\).
1.1.15.2. Con: The law [often protects people from being harassed or discriminated against](https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/legislation-to-combat-racism-and-racial-discrimination)(\(The\)ECRI recommends state authorities to ensure that national criminal law punishes public incitement to violence, hatred or discrimination on the grounds of “race”, colour, language, religion, citizenship, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity.). What some people consider to be impolite or 'un-PC' might be considered to be rude harassment by the law.
1.1.16. Pro: Proponents of PC view it as an aspect of human [rights](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-5/8_udhr-abbr.htm). People who support [basic](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/universal-declaration-human-rights-human-rights-your-fingertips-human-rights-your-fingertips) human rights and champion their viewpoint are not detrimental to society.
1.1.16.1. Con: It is not the support of human rights that can be detrimental. It is possible for much [wrong](https://www.ethicssage.com/2018/04/do-the-ends-justify-the-means.html) to be done in the name of a [virtuous goal](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-provide-some-historical-examples-of-The-ends-justify-the-means).
1.1.16.2. Pro: Not being PC violates [Article 1 of UDHR](https://www.standup4humanrights.org/en/article.html), "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
1.1.16.2.1. Pro: Refusing PC language takes away a person's dignity.
1.1.16.2.1.1. Pro: The way to not be PC is to offend someone or to treat them differently, meaning non-PC people don't treat everyone with respect or don't find the person worthy of something, which takes away their [dignity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dignity).
1.1.16.2.2. Pro: If someone is not being politically correct, they are not acting towards another person in a spirit of brotherhood.
1.1.16.2.3. Pro: Non-PC language has been used to pretend other human beings do not have as good reasoning skills as them.
1.1.16.2.3.1. Pro: [Social Darwinism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-Darwinism) argued that white cultures were more powerful and prosperous than other cultures because of of “natural” inequalities among individuals.
1.1.16.2.3.2. Pro: Charles Murray's 1994 book, The Bell Curve, [argued](https://www.intelltheory.com/bellcurve.shtml#part4) that low IQ tests proved the inferiority of certain economic, ethnic, and racial groups. Meanwhile, it disregard research that pointed to other reasons for low IQ scores.
1.1.16.2.3.3. Pro: [Samuel George Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_George_Morton), the father of American physical anthropology, collected skulls and filled them with sawdust to determine brain volume. Morton believed that cranial capacity determined intellectual ability, and used his measurements to argue in favor of a racial hierarchy which put Caucasians on the top rung and Africans on the bottom.
1.1.16.3. Pro: Not being PC violates [Article 2 of UDHR](https://www.humanrights.com/course/lesson/articles-01-05/read-article-2.html), Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
1.1.16.3.1. Pro: If ones uses language that can be seen as excluding or marginalizing, then they are clearly discriminating against people and making them feel insecure.
1.1.16.4. Pro: Not being PC violates the [third generation of human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_generations_of_human_rights#Third-generation_human_rights): right to life, liberty and security of person.
1.1.16.5. Con: This definition does not capture what many on both the center left and right would deem "political correctness". Most people support basic human rights whether they think of themselves as "PC" or not.
1.1.16.5.1. Pro: Some in the left compare political correctness with [common decency](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taking-back-your-name-the-pros-and-cons-of-political_us_58e3f976e4b09dbd42f3db2a?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_cs=PtIMa4fim55mA-hVHllOvw). While this usually implies supporting basic rights, it could be argued that it's not an inherent aspect of human rights.
1.1.16.5.2. Pro: Some in the right compare political correctness as a tool of [censorship in disguise](http://katehon.com/article/falsehood-political-correctness-and-censorship-disguise), some [liberals](https://medium.com/\@ourania/john-stuart-mill-vs-political-correctness-and-censorship-987aa3979a8b) too. The right claims that being socially forced not to say some things is an "imposed value", that they don't want to have. Liberals think that people should be able to explore taboo ideas.
1.1.16.5.3. Con: Most people support the idea of 'basic human rights' but the common definition of what is a basic human right, or who deserves basic human rights, has changed over time. Political correctness serves to inform our ideas of what is a basic human right by pointing out when we treat others as though they are not people.
1.1.16.5.3.1. Pro: The non-PC term "illegal" is a good example. When one refers to an undocumented person as an "illegal," they are using the term as a noun. The crime is considered to render the individual – as opposed to the individual’s actions at one point in time – as being illegal. [It implies that a person’s existence is criminal](http://nohumanbeingisillegal.com/Home.html). This is a form of [dehumanization](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-web-violence/201806/what-is-dehumanization-anyway). Using PC terminology instead highlights that they are a person with the same human rights as the speaker.
1.1.16.5.3.1.1. Pro: Any time someone reduces a human being to a single characteristic, especially a [negative](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-web-violence/201806/what-is-dehumanization-anyway) one, they are [dehumanizing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/dehumanize) the human.
1.2. Pro: Political Correctness stokes division amongst the public.
1.2.1. Pro: Opposition to "political correctness" has been [used](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/12/09/donald-trump-says-were-all-too-politically-correct-but-is-that-also-a-way-to-limit-speech/?utm_term=.c30b0b1de4b1) by those who find themselves in a privileged position to silence critiques of their privilege and maintain oppressive structures, which are clearly not beneficial to societies.
1.2.1.1. Pro: A diversity of opinions and points of view is [beneficial to society](http://www.teenink.com/opinion/environment/article/465407/The-Importance-and-Benefits-of-Diversity/), and as such it should be encouraged.
1.2.1.2. Pro: In 2015, Donald Trump used rhetoric which blamed political correctness for disenfranchising the majority, [saying](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2015/09/03/the-economist-interviews-donald-trump) "\[The silent majority\] have been disenfranchised. Their country has been taken away from them... people are so worried about being politically correct that they are unable to function."
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.9.3.1.1.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.1.
1.2.4. Con: It shouldn't be divisive since people have nothing to fear about PC.
1.2.5. Con: There is no evidence that "avoiding language or behavior that can be seen as excluding, marginalizing, or insulting groups of people" is in any way divisive.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Use of the n-word is objective evidence that words and language can be used as powerful tools to divide, exclude, stigmatize, and marginalize. So-called political correctness can be a metric for understanding and respect when itself is not used as a tool to divide, exclude, stigmatize, and marginalize.
1.2.5.2. Con: There is evidence of class and intellectual disparagement: to include all people in a discussion the discourse needs to tolerate the limits of vocabulary and culture they are accustomed to. For example, people from a trailer park do not speak the same way as those from the high end of society, but should not be excluded on that basis.
1.2.5.3. Con: For evidence of the above claim, you can simply ask those who have felt excluded, marginalized, or insulted by speech that excludes, marginalizes, or insults them.
1.2.5.4. Con: 'Latinx' is a term society has pushed in an attempt to avoid 'Latino'. However, [90% of Hispanics and Latinos dislike it.](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Over-90-of-Hispanics-and-Latinos-don-t-like-to-15899232.php) This is an example.
1.2.6. Con: Political correctness is society acting upon itself. It's a form of distributed consciousness.
1.2.6.1. Pro: 'Political Correctness' is often used to describe change that rules and regulations have not yet caught up with. Society imposes unwritten rules in the form of PC. As such, PC is society working upon itself to enhance civilisation.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: The use of political correctness is appropriate when pushing a laggard community to stop 'normalising' old values even when those laggards still hold them.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: As an example, an old grand dad who fought 'the Jerry' in the war may be asked to suppress thoughts against Germans as a whole. Rather than change his attitudes he might just swallow his phrases and blame current political correctness. His viewpoints were deliberately fueled by propaganda designed to sustain support for a war but since then, without PC suppression, they could carry down to next generations.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: Any change has a vanguard, depending on the effect of any change it might be said that once a bar is reached \(e.g. the ['early adopters'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) position\) then it is non-PC to voice the opposite. For less important issues the bar may be the views of the 'late majority'.
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: 'Political Correctness' is a way of encouraging people to change their behaviour in a certain way and therefore supports progress.
1.2.6.2. Pro: PC should be viewed as a manifestation emerging from the complexity of social interaction as a consequence and a foundation of social coherence. PC is how we balance the need for change with the need for stability.
1.2.6.3. Con: Political correctness is highly contentious, suggesting it is not a collective action by society, but a selective action by a portion of society to stake control over others.
1.2.7. Con: The disproportionate backlash to PC is detrimental to society, not PC itself.
1.2.7.1. Con: The backlash may not be very destructive, given that the use of non-PC speech does not physically harm anyone.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: '[Jump Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_Jim_Crow)' has indirectly harmed a great number of black Americans by dehumanising them and legitimising violence and oppressive laws against them. It is because of political correctness that greatly physically harmful things like Jim Crow are no longer accepted.
1.2.7.1.1.1. Con: This was not due to political correctness, as the concept didn't exist at that time. PC groups now would still consider early civil rights language out-of-bounds. It is not accurate to conflate sane and good people standing for what is right with PC. People saw something wrong and they stood up for what was right. Historically, this is how things have improved.
1.2.7.1.2. Con: PC speech doesn't physically harm anyone and has a much lower chance of emotionally harming anyone. Thus, non-PC speech does more damage.
1.2.7.1.2.1. Con: No speech physically harms anyone.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1. Con: There are many examples of communication causing physical harm.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Rumors \(true or false\) may be [harmful to people](https://www.webmd.com/balance/health-rumors-gossip#1).
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The evidence for this is compelling and should be taken seriously, but the evidence covers [only certain types of speech and circumstances](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/opinion/sunday/when-is-speech-violence.html). An objection many have is in the overextending of the speech/violence analogy beyond speech that is clearly abusive \( Eg., racism \). Offensive speech has yet to be shown to cause the harm that abusive speech patterns directed at an individual show.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Speech does not have to emotionally harm someone for it to be damaging. Propaganda does not damage someone emotionally, yet most would agree that propaganda which tries to influence people into thinking something contradictory to reality is still damaging to society.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Propaganda can be said to emotionally harm people by manipulating their confidence-in and trust-for the institution putting out the propaganda.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Words can have a [powerful detrimental effect on your nervous system](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10010030).
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: Legally, a person may be deemed responsible for causing physical violence with their voice.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: Libel is the written expression of claims or opinions, which is [legally considered harmful](https://www.hg.org/defamation.html).
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Libel and rumours are deemed unacceptable due to the undue future impact it may have on the treatment of a person, rather than the words themselves being inherently wrong.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.2. Con: Blackmail and verbal threats are a communication of an intention to perform some form of future action, and it is the action which is deemed unacceptable, not the communication/speech.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: The US Supreme Court [ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) that speech which supports violence is protected by the Free Speech Amendment only until the speech directly encourages people to take immediate action.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.4. Pro: [Falsely yelling fire in a crowded theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater) is a well-known hypothetical example about when speech must be limited. [But for](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/but-for_test) the speech of the speaker, no one would be trampled to death.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.6. Pro: PC involves [physical trauma](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/24/the-state-of-the-campus-and-womens-self-censorship/) becoming the outcome of communication instead of respectful discourse.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.6.1. Pro: [Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying_and_suicide), especially [hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust#Genocidal_state) speech and [speeches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#Deaths_in_Jonestown,_Guyana), have [killed](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda) a lot of people.
1.2.7.1.2.1.1.6.1.1. Con: No one has ever died from a voice, but many people have died because they follow the ideas in someone's speech. The two are not the same.
1.2.7.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.1.2.1.1.3.
1.2.7.1.3. Pro: "Sticks and Stones can break my bones" is changed by PC culture to imply the following ending " ...and so can words". The idea of physical harm is conflated with emotional harm in such a way as to imply that words can "[harm](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind-is-speeding-up/570505/)" too.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Political correctness is merely conveying ideas in a way considerate to others. It does not prevent propagation of ideas.
1.2.7.3. Pro: The social backlash caused by non-PC speech is not a result of PC itself, but because the speech is an affront to the values of the listeners.
1.2.7.3.1. Pro: Given that PC is a cultural value and not an institutional policy, we can infer that those who argue against PC are, in effect, aiming to make the current culture of political correctness politically incorrect, thereby establishing a new political correctness. The oxymoron is resolved by realizing that this argument is not really about PC culture \(good/bad\) but rather which values our PC culture is built on.
1.2.7.3.2. Pro: PC is a social practice that has evolved organically around the predominant values in society that should not be confused or conflated with the values themselves nor taken as a value of it's own.
1.2.7.3.3. Pro: Because people don't think about what it's called, people would have been PC for a longer time than the name has been around, from [saving Jews from the Holocaust](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/lens/holocaust-jews-rescuers.html), to giving [rights to women](https://equitas.org/standing-rights-women-girls-religious-minorities-pakistan/) and [minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights).
1.2.7.3.3.1. Con: It was not called PC, because the term didn't apply or register to the people of the time. As such, the term should be considered on its own and for its applicability to contemporary social practice, not retconned into historical events.
1.2.7.3.4. Con: The social backlash towards political correctness is not a backlash against the values, rights or the dignity of human beings but against the current practice itself and its perceived threat to other values.
1.2.7.3.5. Con: The social backlash to critique against PC utilizes the conflation of PC practices with actual humans in order to avoid engaging with the critique. Thus, critics are referred to as "racists" or "fascists" as though simple disagreement with regards to tactics constitutes the hatred of other humans.
1.2.7.3.6. Con: Social backlash caused by non-PC speech is expected and a desired phenomena, which paves way for social discussion.
1.2.7.4. Pro: PC culture becoming mainstream has lead to the formation of a counter PC culture that seeks to undermine and refute PC culture by any means necessary regardless of possible impact to their local communities and the people within them.
1.2.7.4.1. Pro: PC is used by anti-PC people as a slanderous term for a noble action.
1.2.7.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.7.4.1.2. Pro: [Political Correctness is the name given to a set of political agendas by the enemy of those agendas](https://youtu.be/QkvdxS4d0yY?t=512).
1.2.7.4.1.3. Pro: Despite the heated debate surrounding it, political correctness is nothing more than a subset of politeness, which deals specifically with rudeness directed at marginalised groups by dominant groups. Insofar as politeness is not a societal detriment, nor is political correctness.
1.2.7.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.1.1.
1.2.7.4.1.3.2. Con: There are plenty of people opposed to PC viewpoints, such as [Stephen Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJQHakkViPo), who simply feel that PC culture's disproportionate focus on subtle forms oppression and microagressions actually has the opposite of its intended effect.
1.2.7.4.1.3.3. Con: Politeness can also be detrimental to authentic self-expression, which is why there are certain areas of life that are not held to standards of politeness \(e.g. humour, art, drama, science and political debate\), and yet these are the very areas in which political correctness is most pervasive.
1.2.7.4.1.4. Pro: PC is blamed for things it hasn't done.
1.2.7.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.2.1.
1.2.7.4.1.5. Pro: Political correctness is just a name for part of the system by which we value statements. It does not necessarily inhibit free speech and thus harm society, only helps us evaluate speech according to social values. By doing this, it aids social cohesion.
1.2.7.4.1.5.1. Pro: [All statements of fact are value-laden](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/821926-statements-of-fact-are-after-all-statements-which-presumes-a). Thus, even if a statement is true, the question of whether it is consistent with accepted social or moral values is a meaningful one.
1.2.7.4.1.6. Pro: 'Political correctness' has become a catch-all phrase used an as ad hominem to avoid a meaningful argument.
1.2.7.4.1.6.1. Con: Political correctness is a type of [language or behaviour.](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/political-correctness)
1.2.7.4.1.6.2. Con: Political correctness is a [practice.](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/political_correctness)
1.2.7.4.1.6.2.1. Pro: Political correctness is a [belief](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political%20correctness), but not a set of beliefs.
1.2.7.4.1.6.3. Con: Political correctness is [an attitude or policy.](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/political-correctness)
1.2.7.4.1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.2.
1.2.7.4.1.6.5. Pro: PC can be [used](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/political-correctness-how-the-right-invented-phantom-enemy-donald-trump\]) as a [pejorative](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-buzzword-of-the-year-takes-political-correctness-to-task/a-18972956\]) term, along with words like 'snowflake'.
1.2.7.4.1.6.6. Pro: "Political correctness" implies that the purpose for modifying one's speech is to comply with public or popular opinions. This entirely misses the point. Opponents of derogatory speech are intentionally trying to promote a society that is built for everyone, not just those in control.
1.2.7.4.2. Pro: Criticism of PC culture gets personal pretty quickly, sometimes even in the form of forecasting outbursts from "special [snowflakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_\(slang\)#Politicized_insult)" and "triggered SJWs" before any discourse has actually happened, discouraging people from entering discussions.
1.2.7.5. Pro: President Donald Trump is seen by many of his supporters as a direct counter to "PC Culture", and [most agree](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/07/562351087/president-trump-was-elected-a-year-ago-and-americans-are-feeling-aggrieved) that he is a destructive figure \(or at least is not good\).
1.2.7.5.1. Con: If PC is what put a destructive figure into office, then this is an argument against PC, not for.
1.2.7.5.2. Con: It can be argued that Trump's rise is due as much to the shortcomings of PC culture, which have reasonably frustrated many independents and moderate liberals, who choose to pursue 3rd party candidates, not to vote, or in some cases to embrace Trump. PC culture no longer represents them.
1.2.7.6. Con: The backlash was entirely predictable, which calls in to question the tactics of the PC crowd in the first place.
1.2.7.6.1. Con: Many social justice movements have been met with severe backlash in the past before ultimately being accepted and considered in lawmaking \(see slavery, women voting\). The fact that is a "normal" reaction and has been throughout history does not prove that the original idea or tactics are wrong.
1.2.7.6.1.1. Con: Just because something has worked in the past does not mean it will work in the future.
1.2.7.6.2. Pro: [Durkheim's concept of deviance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_\(sociology\)#Durkheim's_concept) predicts that any "serious form of deviance forces people to come together and react in the same way against it.". Deviance in this case, does not mean bad, just a deviation from a cultural norm. By forcing people, through policy and social pressure, to reconsider language, one can expect pressure in the opposite direction and a doubling-down potentially.
1.2.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.
1.2.7.8. Pro: PC is necessary for the progression of our society. We are constantly learning new things about new cultures, especially in our age of freedom of information and globalisation. Refusing this new level of standards is regressive and detrimental to society
1.2.7.9. Con: The fact that an idea is well-intentioned but has unexpected and undesired side effects does not mean that idea is separate from its side-effects. It may be those side-effects which cause the most harm, but that doesn't defend the idea.
1.2.7.9.1. Con: Following this line of reasoning, no change should ever be attempted or suggested because it could provoke backlash. This would mean sacrificing the possibility of long-term harm reduction in favor of short-term harm reduction, which does not guarantee a better outcome for everyone.
1.2.7.9.1.1. Con: This is a straw-man argument. They did NOT say that “no change should ever be attempted or suggested because it could provoke backlash”.
1.2.7.10. Pro: When marginalized people request someone use PC language and the speaker refuses to do so, it dehumanizes them. Thus, it becomes more likely that someone will commit violence against them.
1.2.7.10.1. Con: The harm in a word is the listener's internalization or interpretation of said word. One can say mean or nice things, and the other person can feel harmed.
1.2.7.10.1.1. Pro: If you say "I love you" to a new puppy in an angry way they will be sad, but say "I hate you" in a happy way and they will like it.
1.2.7.10.1.2. Con: Non-PC people are trying to make people feel harmed, otherwise they would just use PC language. That makes it perfectly rational to feel harmed. Non PC people may, on occasion, accidentally say something offensive, but are more likely to face backlash if they repeatedly do it on purpose.
1.2.7.10.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.2.
1.2.7.10.2. Pro: The use of PC language is comparatively innocuous. There is nothing harmful, for instance, in white people not using the n-word.
1.2.7.10.2.1. Con: Without a more comprehensive description of the scope and nature of "PC language" than "white people not using the n-word", the "comparatively innocuous" claim is unsupported and for practical purposes, meaningless.
1.2.7.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.5.3.1.1.
1.2.7.10.4. Pro: Dehumanization makes an 'us, better' and 'them, worse' and in history, purists have used violence to try to [minimise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/18/americans-see-muslims-as-less-than-human-no-wonder-ahmed-was-arrested/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fcdfe27396bc) the other group's rights.
1.2.7.10.5. Pro: Dehumanization allows a perpetrator to [morally justify doing violence](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1990JSI.pdf) to the dehumanized party. It follows that dehumanization is [associated with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/18/americans-see-muslims-as-less-than-human-no-wonder-ahmed-was-arrested/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f94afc2e444e) less sympathy and more aggression.
1.2.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.
1.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.10.4.
1.3. Con: A culture of political correctness protects minorities and those who feel outcast.
1.3.1. Pro: Political correctness is a necessary means to combat hate speech.
1.3.1.1. Con: Political correctness does not stop hate speech. At best it prompts the hateful to show fake politeness, and so encourages two faced behaviour rather than decent behaviour.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: [Overt politeness](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Abstract-illustration-of-the-relationship-between-overt-politeness-behaviors-and_fig1_254088714) \(even when insincere\) is more decent than overt hate speech.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: When segregation ended, whites who did not want to interact with blacks were pressured to at least be polite to them in daily life, which benefited society.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Some individuals opposed to political correctness use hate speech.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Comedian and anti-PC advocate Owen Benjamin [joked about re-instituting slavery to insult a black activist. He also called someone a child molester for allowing their child to identify as non-binary.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90275862/why-is-amazon-promoting-this-anti-trans-alt-right-trolls-comedy-special)
1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.
1.3.1.4. Con: Too many people might call something hate speech simply because they disagree with it.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Hate speech has some [clearly defined characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_hate_speech#Characteristics) and "disagreeing with someone's opinion" is not one of them.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: Hate speech needs to include [insults, personal attacks and/or threats of violence](https://rm.coe.int/factsheet-on-hate-speech-july2018-docx/16808c168d) to be considered hate speech.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.
1.3.1.4.1.1.2. Con: [Many people](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/yes-a-maga-hat-is-a-symbol-of-hate/) [consider](https://uproxx.com/news/maga-hat-hate-symbol/) the [MAGA hat](https://www.gq.com/story/maga-hat-march-for-life) to be [hate speech](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/06/06/you-can-read-white-rage-their-maga-hats/BTe3xOOf6M1UYwOnF07GXM/story.html), despite it containing no insult, personal attack, or threat of violence.
1.3.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: The MAGA can justifiably be considered hate speech because it identifies the wearer with ideas, policies, and cultures that personally attack large groups of protected classes and threaten violence. This identification is strong enough to constitute the spreading of these things by the wearer.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: Hate speech needs to include a [provocative statement](https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/) of outright falsehoods, conspiracy theories or stereotypes to be considered hate speech.
1.3.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Stereotypes can be [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_stereotype) thus not all stereotypes are hate speech.
1.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: Hate speech is often [reductive and aggressive](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1923&context=wmlr) and therefore easily distinguishable from a well thought out argument.
1.3.1.4.1.4. Pro: [Hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) involves speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: "Hate speech" is [loosely defined](https://www.cato.org/blog/hate-speech-laws-undermine-free-speech-equality), dependent on context, and not universally accepted. What one person may deem hate speech another may dispel as colloquialism, metaphor, or misinterpretation by the claimant.
1.3.1.4.3. Con: Hate speech has been defined by courts through case law.
1.3.1.4.3.1. Con: "Hate speech" laws are [lacking precision](https://www.ihrb.org/news-events/press-centre/the-challenge-of-criminalising-hate-speech) and are difficult to measure. This makes an already complicated system of law even more subjective.
1.3.1.4.3.2. Con: Different states and counties can have [different definitions of hate speech](https://www.npr.org/2011/03/03/134239713/France-Isnt-The-Only-Country-To-Prohibit-Hate-Speech).
1.3.1.4.3.3. Pro: The [European Court of Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf) ruled on dozens of cases whether something constitutes hate speech or is covered by freedom of expression.
1.3.1.4.3.3.1. Con: The European Court of Human Rights has no [jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_jurisdiction_\(United_States\)) over defining "Hate Speech" outside the EU.
1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.7.1.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Hate speech is an [Ad Hominem logical fallacy](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/6/18/986499/-), and often a sweeping generalisation and therefore are invalid and should not be in an argument.
1.3.1.7. Pro: Political correctness combats hate speech by demoting it.
1.3.1.7.1. Con: Hate speech is still speech.
1.3.1.7.2. Pro: The right to free [speech](https://www.humanrights.com/course/lesson/articles-19-25/read-article-19.html) does not mean that people are free to insult or harass other people on the basis of discrimination without people around them being horrified.
1.3.1.7.3. Pro: [Offensiveness is not bad for your body and brain.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/opinion/sunday/when-is-speech-violence.html) PC conflates abusive speech and offensive speech, the former of which is detrimental, the latter of which is not.
1.3.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.
1.3.1.8. Con: Avoiding the problem is not addressing the problem. PC only hides what is believed to be "bad", without addressing the "why's" and "how" of stopping it.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.12.1.
1.3.2. Con: PC culture protects no one from being accused of not being PC.
1.3.2.1. Pro: If majority groups can be accused, so can minority groups. Then no one feels protected from backlash or dwelling on whether they are being PC or not.
1.3.3. Pro: Political correctness enables free speech for those that would be attacked personally otherwise.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Oppressed groups have enough difficulties just to discuss difficult topics, and anything \(such as not being politically correct\) could hinder opportunities and chances for these discussions to reach their potential, or to happen at all. Political correctness creates opportunities that would not occur otherwise.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Political correctness blocks majority groups from reaching their potential in or even having discussions to the same effect that avoiding political correctness has on minority groups within discussions.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The opposite of political correctness is insensitive insults and bullying. When a majority group engages in regular marginalization of a minority, it has a profoundly chilling effect on that part of society. The harms of PC are far less than the harms of bullying.
1.3.3.3. Pro: Stating that women are more acting in the realm of emotions rather than logic, unlike men, discredits the ideas of women in a one-on-one debate. Using PC language means not discrediting the other person for what they are, but listening to what they say. This improves discourse.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The more emotionally-minded are still capable of logic; just as the more logically-minded are still capable of emotion.
1.3.3.4. Pro: A mindset that Black people are inferior will discredit ideas by African Americans.
1.3.3.4.1. Con: It will only discredit ideas among people who share that mindset. Censoring discussions does not keep racists from being dismissive. People would rather want to know who the racists are.
1.3.3.4.1.1. Con: Allowing people to insult, harass, and stereotype other people in the open helps the harassment spread.
1.3.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Engaging someone in a rational discussion of their views does more to challenge them than to just dismiss their argument by saying they're mean for expressing it. Harassment only spreads in an environment where spectators find insults convincing, which happens when they are unaccustomed to reasoned debate: it's the environment PC creates.
1.3.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.4.
1.3.3.4.2. Con: This is not a common mindset. This is called being a racist, and voicing opinions like these will get you stigmatized and scorned.
1.3.3.4.2.1. Con: Being stigmatized and scorned for unacceptable opinions is the whole point of political correctness.
1.3.3.4.2.1.1. Con: PC scorns people for expressing "bad" beliefs, but not for having them, or even acting in accordance with them.
1.3.3.4.2.2. Con: While it may be scorned, it doesn't follow that it isn't a common mindset.
1.3.3.4.3. Con: Free speech does not constitute that you have to believe what you hear.
1.3.3.4.3.1. Con: Not believing what you hear doesn't stop other people from believing what they hear.
1.3.3.4.3.2. Con: That seems like a fairly privileged stance to take. We must consider the [millions of people who receive substandard education](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/one-million-children-receiving-substandard-education-7198951.html), or [have intellectual deficits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability), or for whatever other reason are less equipped to discern what is true and what is prejudiced propaganda.
1.3.3.5. Con: Attacks are part of free speech. Using science and logic to debunk these attacks has more value than dismissing them on the basis that you don't like them.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: [Personal attacks \(ad hominem\)](https://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html) on the base of an individual's fundamental characteristic\(s\) are not part of free speech, and as such have no place in public discourse.
1.3.3.5.2. Con: [The harm principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle) applied to psychological harm is a good justification to ban personal attacks, it’s far from being just “because someone doesn’t like it”.
1.3.3.5.3. Con: This claim depends heavily on the priorities one has. If one values safety over freedom, then it’s more valuable to dismiss personal attacks than letting the responsibility of the verbal defense on the victim.
1.3.3.5.4. Con: Attacks are part of free speech, but they are meaningless in discourse and serve only to distract from the topic at hand. Political correctness dismisses them allowing for meaningful conversation to continue. It doesn't mean that it is illegal to attack another person, only that the attacks will not be allowed to take over the discourse.
1.3.3.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.
1.3.3.6. Pro: PC culture supports terminology designed to ensure groups typically deflected, discouraged, or emotionally and psychologically harmed by improper terminology are welcomed to discourse, thereby encouraging discourse by removing linguistic ad hominem.
1.3.3.6.1. Con: Because everyone has a different perception of what can be said, political correctness tends to silence people. People do not speak because they fear hurting someone's feelings.
1.3.3.6.1.1. Con: Promoting carefulness when talking about delicate topics and making people fear that they could hurt someone's feelings helps to ensure that marginalized groups are welcomed to discourse.
1.3.3.6.1.1.1. Con: This tactic fails where two marginalized groups are ideologically opposed to each other and one of them must be defended against the other.
1.3.3.6.1.1.2. Con: This "carefulness" can be seen as condescending and patronizing. To give full dignity to someone, one needs to consider honesty. It is insulting to gloss over someone's flaws to protect their feelings as one would with a child.
1.3.3.6.2. Con: Attempting to remove linguistic ad hominem across the board, for all people, in all situations and at all times, by creating a comprehensive set of acceptable and unacceptable words and phrases, and an enforcement mechanism \(presumably, legislation\), requires a totalitarian approach to curtail the freedom of speech.
1.3.3.7. Con: Free speech, where it is afforded uniformly, is [enshrined in law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country), not in an optional, subjective component of culture.
1.3.4. Con: If one can be fired for not using PC speech, it would be a detriment to society.
1.3.4.1. Con: Firing one person is bad for them, not for everyone else in society.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Firing an employee who uses non-PC speech is beneficial to members of society who are proponents of PC since they no longer have to tolerate non-PC speech at that location.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Segregation can lead to further conflict, such as the case during [the civil rights movement era](https://www.britannica.com/event/American-civil-rights-movement) in America.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Punishing people for hurting others \(which is what made their speech problematic\) is far from being segregation.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The end result is that one group segregates itself from another group of people because they think that their speech is problematic. Changing the context it would be akin to rich people segregating themselves from poor people because they don't like that their speech is less refined.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In that analogy there is no one hurting because of "less refined speech". It has nothing to do with PC, because now the core of the problem is gone.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: For someone who considers it important, "less refined speech" could be equated with problematic speech.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Applying the [harm principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle), rich people have no right to take actions to others just because of their “less refined speech.” There is no real evidence that this hurts or discriminates them in any sense.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: In that analogy, rich people are clearly discriminating poor people. The amount of money one has does not cause their speech to hurt others, which was the main justification to punish that person in the original argument.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: In the analogy, being rich or poor is irrelevant, as the focus was on the speech of one group compared to that of another.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: One of the [top five reasons](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-reasons-to-fire-an-employee-1917577) \(nowadays\) to fire people is "Code of conduct violation", doing what the employer thinks as unethical behaviour. Using speech that hurts a coworker or a customer without a good reason behind it is unethical, and falls under this category.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: We usually talk about segregation with this [meaning](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/segregation): "the institutional separation of an ethnic, racial, religious, or other minority group from the dominant majority". Firing people for actions that hurt others does not follow this definition.
1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Segregation for arbitrary reasons \(such as skin color\) is bad. However, segregation does not always lead to conflict.
1.3.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Students are [segregated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/segregation) into remedial or advanced classes, so that teachers can more accurately meet their needs.
1.3.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: While more needs are met, this does not necessarily mean that conflict is avoided.
1.3.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: What is bad is subjective.
1.3.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Separation from particular actions is done everyday on reasonable situations to solve issues, without adding worse issues/conflicts. Examples of this are prisons, harassment laws, [banning people from establishments](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/legal-rights-business-ban-person-property-65571.html), other reasons to fire people, etc.
1.3.4.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Harassment laws [protect people](https://communitylaw.org.nz/community-law-manual/chapter-27-harassment-and-bullying/harassment-in-the-community-getting-protection-under-the-harassment-act/) from being harassed again, banning people from establishments helps to make the business safer for the rest of the customers, and prisons help us to protect ourselves from dangerous criminals. All these examples do solve prevalent issues.
1.3.4.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Reporting and blocking people in webs and social networks can certainly escalate to further conflict, but it’s more valuable that people have the control of who can talk to them and their feeling of safety caused by having less probability to be harassed again by this accounts than the value of the possible future conflict.
1.3.4.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: It’s not clear how can we protect people from murderers or from harassers without separating them temporarily from possible victims.
1.3.4.1.1.1.3.4. Con: Prisoners can hurt one another or potentially guards, prisoners fight one another, [recidivism in America](https://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/Pages/welcome.aspx) totals 83% over the course of 9 years \(68% in the first 3 years\).
1.3.4.1.1.1.4. Con: Separation can reduce conflict by taking aggressors away from victims.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: People are part of society, what is bad for them has an impact on society. Unemployment is thus bad for society at large.
1.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: People have families. What negatively affects them might also affect their family.
1.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Firing one person can be bad for their individual family, but this is not a problem for other families in the society.
1.3.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: A society is merely an organized group of people, if a family is negatively impacted, then so might that society be.
1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: A certain level of unemployment is considered necessary in order to have a healthy economy. Workers are always coming and going, looking for better jobs. This jobless status, until they find that new job, is the "[natural rate](https://www.thebalance.com/natural-rate-of-unemployment-definition-and-trends-3305950)" of unemployment.
1.3.4.1.2.3. Con: It won't lead to unemployment because someone else would be hired.
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Many people would have to be [replaced after being fired](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-you-were-fired-would-you-rather-be-replaced-by-a-human-or-a-robot-these-workers-have-a-surprising-answer-2019-08-13), which negates the detrimental bit to society.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: Permanently removing people from specialized professions might cause a challenging deficit in the employment pool for that field.
1.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: If [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) were no longer able to find work in the public spectrum, there would as a consequence be far fewer celebrity science advocates \(as there are already very few such people\).
1.3.4.2. Pro: Unemployment has been linked with [child maltreatment](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2010-10-unemployment-linked-child-maltreatment.html).
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Firing particular people for particular reasons is not linked with an increase on unemployment rates.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: Strict firing restrictions \(such as "You can't fire people for not using politically correct speech"\) are linked with an [increase in umemployment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840701736131?journalCode=raec20) rates.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: Along the [causes of unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_unemployment_in_the_United_States#Overview) in the U.S., the most notable ones are economic conditions or demographic and techonology trends. It seems that changes on hiring or firing policy don't affect that much.
1.3.4.2.1.3. Con: While unemployment rates may not increase, the accumulated effects of people being fired will increase with each subsequent firing and rehiring.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: [The stresses of poverty have long been associated with child abuse and neglect](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2010-10-unemployment-linked-child-maltreatment.html). However, the longer one stays unemployed, the higher the risk of falling into \(or further into\) poverty. Therefore, "whether they are able to find work afterwards" is relevant.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Unemployment has been linked with [higher mortality rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677456/).
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: The economic crisis of 2008-10, and the rise in unemployment that accompanied it, was associated with more than [260,000](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/economic-downturn-excess-cancer-deaths-atun/) excess cancer-related deaths
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Unemployment has been associated with [50% higher risk of death](https://www.alphagalileo.org/en-gb/Item-Display/ItemId/149910?returnurl=https://www.alphagalileo.org/en-gb/Item-Display/ItemId/149910) in heart failure patients.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: Unemployment is related to an [increase in stress](https://jech.bmj.com/content/69/7/673).
1.3.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.1.
1.3.4.4. Con: There are numerous [reasons to fire people](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-reasons-to-fire-an-employee-1917577), and the possibility to fire people is not a detriment to society. This would be one example of that, it fits under a [Code of Conduct violation](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/happens-employee-violated-code-conduct-16118.html).
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.
1.3.4.5. Pro: There's a risk that this option to fire people for not being PC will be used in situations where that person didn't deserve a punishment.
1.3.4.5.1. Con: We live everyday with the risk of false accusations for every possible law. The solution is to improve the process of firing so this doesn’t happen, not to ignore it completely.
1.3.5. Con: Political correctness is making outcasts of those who hold unpopular opinions, and offers no protection for the type of outcasts it creates. It only protects the outcasts it deems to currently be trendy.
1.3.5.1. Con: PC protects innocent outcasts and tries to hold accountable those who are guilty of non-PC speech.
1.3.6. Pro: Political Correctness is about changing particular words and being careful about speech so others are not offended. This benefits visibility and social awareness of minority groups.
1.3.7. Pro: Ruthless governments use racist or antisemitic tropes to make the general population more passive to actions against ethnic and religious groups. Political correctness attempts to prevent such things from happening again by denouncing governments and political parties who do that.
1.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.3.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Racist tropes in media were used to justify [slavery](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/08/european-racism-africa-slavery) in Europe, US, Central and South America, as well as [segregation](https://isreview.org/issue/84/race-and-media-united-states) in the US. Racist tropes are now considered beyond political correctness but still reappear from conservative politicians.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: Political correctness now acts as a form of societal peer policing, ensuring that such racist tropes are not deemed acceptable in our societies anymore.
1.3.7.3. Pro: "Scientific" racism created the support for institutionalized racism. It lead to the rationalization of [US slavery,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Justification_of_slavery_in_the_US) [Nazi Eugenics and ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#Eugenics), and [South Africa Apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#South_African_apartheid). Scientific racism is now considered not politically correct.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: Eugenics being unpopular post-WW2 is an example of cultural learning. PC cannot be credited with its unpopularity, and it hasn't prevented more recent massacres. Stalin's [purges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge), Mao's [cultural revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) and [Pol Pot's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot#Leader_of_Kampuchea) [year zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Zero_\(political_notion\)) were not stopped by PC.
1.3.7.4. Con: Political correctness imposes a restriction on the people and their speech, not on the government.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: If people are united, that is they stand up for each other against discrimination even when it doesn't effect an individually personally, they may have the power to change the government, especially in a democracy.
1.3.7.4.2. Pro: Politically correct speech is what one can say without backlash from the others with power over them. Those who have the power decide what is politically correct.
1.3.7.5. Con: If political correctness only concerned itself with denouncing racist political parties, there wouldn't need to be a discussion about it. But PC goes far beyond that in our current political climate, which is the problem.
1.3.7.5.1. Pro: Speakers are regularly [deplatformed](https://intellectualdarkweb.site/speakers-who-have-been-deplatformed-on-college-campuses/) by protests on college campuses, even if they are invited and paid for by students.
1.3.7.5.2. Pro: PC public pressure can result in [livelihoods being ruined](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/justine-sacco-speaks-about-her-experience-one-year-after-the-tweet-that-ruined-her-life/news-story/993b0788fdbda58794abb7ee53be04ed).
1.3.7.5.3. Pro: -> See discussion #17165: Social Media sites disproportionately target conservative users.
1.3.7.5.4. Con: This is [question begging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question). It asserts that political correctness being utilized in contexts outside of political parties is a problem without establishing why this claim should be taken seriously or what the relevance of parties is to the normative/ethical claim.
1.3.7.6. Con: Blatantly racist/antisemitic speech is not simply politically incorrect; racism has always existed in a similar form, while political correctness is ever-changing and reflects the general public’s increasing sensitivity to various topics.
1.3.8. Pro: It makes more sense that the majority learns to be politically correct than small minorities learning to deal with suffering.
1.3.8.1. Pro: “Learning to deal with suffering” is an expression, but there is no easy method to learn that. From an “efficient” point of view, the conclusion is the same; people can’t change their feelings easily, but they can change what they say.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: Humans inherently [deal with suffering](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/meditation-modern-life/201410/the-three-ways-we-deal-or-not-suffering).
1.3.8.1.1.1. Con: "There are three options we can choose: we can suppress our feelings, we can feel them, or we can grow from them. " All the options involve feeling the pain, people don't learn to deal with constant suffering.
1.3.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: \(For the first option\) "It’s one reason there is so much suffering in the world, because when we suppress our suffering, it doesn’t go away; it just gets put aside for a little bit, and then we need to suppress it more and more."
1.3.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: "If we choose this second option of dealing with our pain and suffering, then the third option occurs."
1.3.8.1.1.1.3. Pro: The options are to suffer with it or to make it worse. Neither are good choice when having to repeatedly deal with the same source of suffering.
1.3.8.2. Pro: There doesn't seem to be any harm in someone choosing to be PC.
1.3.8.3. Pro: Changing your vocabulary needs only your intention to do it, while changing your emotions with coping methods or something like that usually needs time and other parties \(psychology, support comunities, etc\) to help you.
1.3.8.4. Con: It would be the opposite if one doesn't take morality into account. Making a smaller group learn something would be more efficient than making a larger group learn something.
1.3.8.5. Con: [Minorities themselves do not support political correctness.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) The politically correct themselves are a minority that seems primarily concerned with their own power, not the power of other minorities.
1.3.9. Pro: Even someone who is part of the majority can be considered disadvantaged, and therefore could be considered a victim of non PC language.
1.3.9.1. Con: If true, it certainly is [not](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/08/03/an-asian-american-womans-tweets-ignite-a-debate-is-it-okay-to-make-fun-of-white-people-online/?utm_term=.5f0b45b396e7) as true as PC being for minorities.
1.3.10. Pro: A lot of non-PC views are based on false premises - for example, white supremacy - and treating these views as if they are on par with evidence based discussions has legitimized dangerous and destructive movements.
1.3.10.1. Con: Arguing on the basis of evidence and thoughtful critique is exactly what should be done. Arguing on the basis of words used to express an idea is not useful, as it does not get to the route of the problem \(the idea itself\).
1.3.11. Pro: Anti-PC advocates draw an arbitrary line between a factual statement and one that is based on personal feelings.
1.3.11.1. Pro: Almost all strong opinions and moral values are based on personal experience and therefore, emotional reactions to certain situations and words. Separating "fact" from "emotion" is nearly impossible. The solution cannot be to deny any emotional component to one's views, but to acknowledge and address it.
1.3.11.2. Pro: Anti-PC people claim personal feelings should not matter in a debate and should not be taken into consideration, although their claims of being "silenced" and "censored" are also a result of their personal feelings being hurt.
1.3.11.3. Con: Although talking in a PC-manner can show respect, it becomes a huge problem when certain fact-based arguments are being trumped for non-factual reasons.
1.3.11.3.1. Con: Fact-based arguments, if they are actually fact-based, by definition do not need to include insults or biased wording, so they are not threatened by PC.
1.3.11.3.2. Con: PC actually tries to draw out the non-factual undertones of an argument by pointing out the part that gender/race/etc. biases can play in the interpretation of data and the search for facts. The goal is to encourage factual discussion, not stifle it.
1.3.11.3.3. Con: It is possible for people to use the mantle of PC to disrupt conversation, but the purpose of PC is to create meaningful dialogue by preventing parties from using inflammatory language and emotion based arguments. It does not invalidate facts, but requires facts over emotions.
1.3.12. Con: This does not apply to those who are outcast for holding what are deemed to be un-PC views, which can make these outcast groups feel silenced.
1.3.12.1. Con: This draws a false equivalence between two types of outcast. You should be condemned for being racist, not for being black.
1.3.12.2. Con: -> See 1.3.11.2.
1.3.12.3. Pro: Over time this can encourage such outcasts to take more drastic action in order to be heard.
1.3.13. Con: A culture of free and open expression allows everybody to speak, regardless of whether they're outcasts.
1.3.13.1. Con: Rejecting PC is not guaranteeing free and open expression, as it allows loud people with prejudices to shout down and over reasonable debate with hate filled rhetoric.
1.3.13.2. Con: A lack of political correctness can stifle individuals or groups unfairly, taking away their voice completely. Political correctness merely moderates speech while everyone remains involved.
1.3.14. Con: In the name of protecting marginalized groups, political correctness propagates myths and untruths.
1.3.14.1. Pro: People might form their [own perspectives](https://medium.com/the-dark-arts-of-genius/the-evil-of-political-correctness-30541e25f140) on how to be politically correct. So when they [display their political correctness](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/05/empathetically-correct-is-the-new-politically-correct/371442/), they may indirectly propagate stereotypes through it.
1.3.14.1.1. Con: PC-proponents [argue](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-08/shaw-put-your-gaydar-down/6758912) [against](https://www.voa.org/blog/charities-stop-stereotyping-people-of-color-as-needy) stereotyping. Dissolving stereotypes is at the heart of using PC terms.
1.3.14.1.1.1. Pro: Political correctness educates people about the meanings and context behind the words and terms they use. This makes them conscious of the impact their words and language can have on others.
1.3.14.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.10.1.
1.3.14.1.2. Pro: The [backlash](https://reason.com/2018/10/11/political-correctness-americans-vote-maj/) towards political correctness \(because PC culture exists and is hated\) or [using political correctness as a tool](https://freedomoutpost.com/the-use-of-racism-in-political-correctness/) pushes racism and hate through those too.
1.3.14.2. Pro: The use of neutral pronouns propagates the idea that gender is exclusively a social construct, when it is also [biological](https://qz.com/1190996/scientific-research-shows-gender-is-not-just-a-social-construct/).
1.3.14.2.1. Con: If a person's sex characteristics [changes at puberty](https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/people/the-village-where-girls-turn-into-boys.aspx) from female to male then we have been calling them "she" for a decade when they were always chromosomaly male. This means gender is based upon our perception and not actual sex.
1.3.14.2.2. Con: -> See discussion #1570: Gender is a social construct.
1.3.14.3. Con: Political correctness can't spread any lies since it is about using non-offensive terminology or behaviour.
1.3.14.3.1. Con: Political correctness incorporates much more than mere terminology. Political correctness includes ideas about social justice.
1.3.14.3.1.1. Pro: It asks that people stop [cultural appropriation](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/03/campus-email-white-girls-stop-wearing-hoop-earrings-cultural-appropriation/).
1.3.15. Con: Political correctness deals in a lot in ideals. A minority who holds a politically incorrect idea will be an outcast among outcasts.
1.3.15.1. Pro: The same holds true with someone from the majority who has a politically incorrect idea. Peer pressure exists in every society and it effects everyone.
1.3.16. Pro: Political correctness adds a societal power to the oppressed. When an oppressed group shows offense or disapproval to discourse, it is due to the context of how that opinion hurts them.
1.3.16.1. Con: Being offended is a reasonable trade-off for ensuring free speech.
1.3.16.1.1. Con: Free speech cannot be assumed to be inherently good. Total free speech does not exist in society, laws against slander and harassment exist exactly because sometimes free speech is not more valuable than its cost.
1.3.16.2. Pro: Taking offense to something is a useful feeling that alerts one to imbalances of power.
1.4. Pro: Political correctness limits free speech, and by extension free thought.
1.4.1. Con: PC language is an effort to alter social norms. It is not based in law/criminal sanction.
1.4.1.1. Con: The [existence of legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127) which imposes [criminal sanctions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-43816921) on those who [breach the standards](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/15/london-drill-rap-gang-banned-from-making-music-due-to-threat-of-violence) that political correctness seeks to establish, as well as the wilful use of legislation to [criminalise patterns of speech previously seen as acceptable](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6687123/Mother-arrested-children-calling-transgender-woman-man.html), proves that there is a legal arm to political correctness, and not just a social one.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Such [legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127) targets people who go out of their way to troll others. Political correctness alone is not enough to convict. It must be part of a larger action of harassment, stalking, or threat.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Chelsea Russell was likely trolling when she [publicly posted lyrics about killing on the memorial page of someone she didn’t know who’d just been killed](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/woman-who-posted-rap-lyrics-14543694), and [whose uncle was killed in a famous hate crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Anthony_Walker) using some of [the same words she used](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-killing-of-anthony-the-boy-who-died-because-of-the-colour-of-his-skin-517644.html).
1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that inferences have to be drawn and assumptions made in order to justify this prosecution show that it isn't in accordance with "innocence until proven guilty" but is rather an attempt to push an agenda.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: "[Innocent until proven guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence#Meaning)" is the idea that the prosecution has the obligation to prove each element of the offense "beyond a reasonable doubt" and that the accused bears no burden of proof. Judges deemed the facts to be enough to dispel reasonable doubt that her post indicated “[intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress... uses threatening, abusive or insulting words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_harassment,_alarm_or_distress)."
1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The intent of Chelsea Russell cannot be determined with absolute authority but it is commonly cited that she was doing it out of respect. Even if she was trolling, the option to delete her comment and block her from the page exists. Criminal prosecution is excessive, disproportionate, and requires the assumption of her mindset at the time, which is exactly what people are accusing Political Correctness of being; thought policing.
1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Intent is legally determined in court cases. Courts have been given this authority.
1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: By this logic, no one should ever be found guilty of intentional-murder, so long as they claim that they killed in self-defense.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The rap group 1011 was issued with a court order that bans them from making music without police review when it was discovered that 1011 and rival group 12 World were using [lyrics to threaten, and as a basis for carrying out, physical violence against rivals and relatives](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/15/london-drill-rap-gang-banned-from-making-music-due-to-threat-of-violence).
1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: Kate Scottow was arrested after using multiple twitter accounts to carry out a ["campaign of targeted harassment"](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6687123/Mother-arrested-children-calling-transgender-woman-man.html) against transwoman Stephanie Hayden, including publishing non-PC-related defamatory statements such as "stating she was... a crook and mocking her as a fake lawyer."
1.4.2. Con: An inhospitable environment to entirely free speech and free will is not necessarily detrimental to society.
1.4.2.1. Con: Political correctness stifles our ability to talk out problems through social discourse. This makes some problems unsolvable.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Given that non-PC viewpoints are really those whose underlying premises consist of feelings of supremacy based on characteristics such as faith, race, orientation, ethnicity, gender, ability, and national origin, or of misinformation or willful ignorance, legitimate debate is very easy to hold while being politically correct.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: All criticism that can be linked to an aspect of faith, race, orientation, ethnicity, gender, ability or national origin, can be considered by some to be non-PC. Assuming that all such criticism is based on a feeling of supremacy, it is itself a bigoted gross over-generalisation that can, and very often does, shut down legitimate debate.
1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: On the contrary, the above comment is not an assumption that all criticism linked to faith, race, orientation, ethnicity, gender, ability, or national origin is non-PC, but rather an explanation of what makes something non-PC.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.4.1.3.2.
1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: This claim does not coincide with everybody's view of what is or isn't PC.
1.4.2.1.1.4. Con: Political Correctness is a movement on the [progressive left](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-019-00094-4). Non-PC viewpoints are viewpoints that the majority of the rest of the globe holds.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: According to [The Cato 2017 Free Speech and Tolerance Survey](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america), a national poll of 2,300 U.S. adults, nearly three-fourths \(71%\) of Americans believe that political correctness has done more to silence important discussions our society needs to have.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Strong majorities](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america) of white Americans \(74%\), African Americans \(64%\), and Latinos \(58%\) agree that political correctness has silenced necessary conversations.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: PC culture stifles the "marketplace of ideas", wherein all ideas are welcome in public discourse, but the bad ones are weeded out, and only the best, most beneficial ideas become broadly accepted.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: PC limits politicians and people with power to discuss problems in society. Even when based on facts, these discussions could be found offensive to some people.
1.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: The best example is a discussion or study of migration. In [Europe](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/478763), a lot of countries suffer from migrants with totally different backgrounds and cultures who put pressure on the social security system. Anybody trying to discuss this issue is, in most cases, called a racist/xenophobe/fascist/nazi etc.
1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: PC culture on some campuses in the US and UK have a tendency to [censor](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/23/petition-urges-cardiff-university-to-cancel-germain-greer-lecture), [rather than addressing views they disagree with](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/the-authoritarian-left-reaches-rock-bottom-the-no-platforming-of-peter-tatchell-in-the-uk/). The "truths" of progressive viewpoints are seen as unquestionably true and license to demonize anyone who doesn't conform.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1. Con: The potential of people seeing the "truths" of their side of the political spectrum as "axiomatically true" exists regardless of political leaning.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: This stems from a desire for simple answers, mental shortcuts and easy solutions, which is something every human is prone to on some level. Human brains like patterns and predictability; nuanced views are harder to argue and harder to think about.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Proponents of PC culture have often already examined the arguments of those conservative viewpoints and found reasons they are wrong. It is not that they are not willing to address conservative viewpoints, its that those viewpoints have already been addressed and disproved, yet people repeat them.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: People who were [more likely than average to complete college](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a70a7c3010027736a22740f/t/5bbcea6b7817f7bf7342b718/1539107467397/hidden_tribes_report-2.pdf) \(pg 30\) were also more likely to endorse political correctness.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.8.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: This is an [Appeal to Accomplishment](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/19/Appeal-to-Accomplishment) logical fallacy. Ideas presented by the educated should be reinforced by sound arguments and facts.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.1.3. Con: The educated are better at defending their ideas, even bad ideas, but this does not mean they have greater access to "truth". Being able to overpower in debate is not the same as truth seeking. Some suggest that [smart people can believe weird things because they’re really good at rationalizing beliefs.](https://lifelessons.co/personal-development/skepticmichaelshermer2/)
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.1.4. Con: Education does not necessarily lead to morality. Troublemakers in many parts of the world are often quite well-educated, so it is not just education that we need. [- The Dalai Lama](https://twitter.com/DalaiLama/status/1098892705873022976?s=19)

1.4.2.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.1.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4. Con: Many proponents of PC have not [examined](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article54924950.html) the [arguments](https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-71-americans-say-political-correctness-has-silenced-discussions-society-needs-have-58-have) but simply follow the [lead of people](https://iea.org.uk/blog/the-economics-of-political-correctness) in [power](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2018/03/04/havard-bows-political-correctness/111088370/).
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: [Oriental](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-tsuchiyama-oriental-insult-20160601-snap-story.html) has become a non-PC word. It is not considered derogatory. At worst it generalized people from the east as a group much like all white [Europeans](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/is-the-word-occidental-a-derogatory-word.2160595/) are [Occidental](https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-77570.html) but that term is not restricted.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1.1. Con: [Oriental is a term that refers to objects.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oriental) [Occidentals, on the other hand, can refer to people.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/occidental)
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1.1.1. Con: [Oriental](http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/oriental) used to refer to [people.](http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/oriental)
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1.2. Con: [Oriental is an ethnocentric \("Eurocentric"\) term dating back to when people in Asia were subjugated by Europeans.](https://www.thoughtco.com/avoid-these-five-racial-terms-2834959)
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Europeans were never subjugated by Asians. Asians are not invoking old prejudices by calling Europeans 'occidental'.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: Occidental is a word Europeans \(and other English speakers\) use to describe other Europeans. "Oriental" is a term Europeans use to describe another culture.
1.4.2.1.3.2.2.4.1.3. Con: In the same vein as the word['Negro', 'Oriental' has fallen out of accepted speech because it is considered outdated.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/obama-signs-bill-eliminating-negro-spanish-speaking-oriental-from-federal-laws)
1.4.2.1.3.2.3. Con: Conservatives feel this way because they have [a stronger physiological response to threat and are more reactive to fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-in-the-machine/201612/fear-and-anxiety-drive-conservatives-political-attitudes). This increased sensitivity distorts their view of fairness and leads them to conclude they are [unfairly](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/08/24/do-immigrants-steal-jobs-from-american-workers/) treated.
1.4.2.1.3.2.3.1. Con: [It's not just conservatives who feel this way](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) about political correctness. So even if this claim is true, there are liberals who feel this way too.
1.4.2.1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Among traditional liberals, [61%](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) believe that political correctness is a problem.
1.4.2.1.3.2.4. Pro: For PC culture to make its mark on culture at large, it should allow for transparent discussion of issues it finds controversial. It should emulate debate strategies that self-perpetuate and self-style the civility it advocates through difficult discussions on cultural issues.
1.4.2.1.3.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.4.2.1.3.2.6. Con: PC culture criticizes conservative viewpoints. That is not the same as censorship.
1.4.2.1.3.2.6.1. Con: PC culture does not engage in intellectual criticism here in the US. They de-platform, chant and generally make nuisances of themselves as opposed to engagement with ideas they disagree with.
1.4.2.1.3.2.6.1.1. Con: If someone has the view that people from the other side of the political spectrum do nothing but "chant and generally make nuisances of themselves", this can be seen as a sign that they themselves don't engage with ideas they diasgree with either, effectively being guilty of the same behavior they accuse the other person of. Nothing would prevent them from taking the first step to understand the opposing viewpoint.
1.4.2.1.3.2.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.5.1.
1.4.2.1.3.2.6.1.3. Con: These behaviors are mostly isolated to the extreme Left, social justice and identity politics movements.
1.4.2.1.3.2.7. Con: PC culture is not closed off to counter-arguments in general, it just sets a standard on how these arguments should be worded \(without verbally discriminating others\). Suggesting that basic rules for what constitutes civil discourse could lead to censorship is a fallacious slippery slope argument.
1.4.2.1.3.3. Con: Ideas that are strong enough to represent legitimate arguments against ideas defended by PC culture are not shut down so much as are ideas not strong enough to represent legitimate arguments.
1.4.2.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.8.10.2.1.
1.4.2.1.3.5. Con: Without protections against hate speech for minorities, many would not feel comfortable themselves contributing to the free marketplace of ideas.
1.4.2.1.3.6. Pro: Instead of a censorship culture via preventing the use of certain words and ideas, we need a culture that encourages admitting one's former ignorance, and subsequent change of opinion.
1.4.2.1.3.7. Pro: Examples of this would be the changing of work by [Mark Twain](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jan/05/censoring-mark-twain-n-word-unacceptable); over-reaction to mistakes by innocent [presenters](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/11/bbc-dj-david-lowe-quits-racism-row-jeremy-clarkson); and [debate](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/fall-2011/straight-talk-about-the-nword) of the double standard of use of the word based on the colour of the speaker's skin.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Censorship of some speech is necessary for the free speech of others.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: Censorship is larger than a balancing of rights, but represents the [forfeit of speech to a governing body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Anti-Racism_Law).
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: We could also say that the "inconveniences" of a law against murder is not curbing of your actions, but the forfeit of actions to a governing body. This does not make this law unnecessary or unfair.
1.4.2.2.2.1.1. Con: That’s a false equivalence between laws prohibiting murder and laws prohibiting speech.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Con: We already manage to balance individual freedoms while forbidding words which ["by their very utterance, inflict injury"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fighting_words) or are [obscence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions#Obscenity).
1.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Political correctness has no end to its means. If a proponent of PC decides "obscene" is a term which might upset someone, conjuring visual images of obscene things, even the parent claim comment supporting PC can be considered politically incorrect.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: The [concept of free speech](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/two-concepts-of-freedom-of-speech/546791/) incorporates ideas about when and how speech must be [limited](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does).
1.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.3.
1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.1.2.1.1.5.4.
1.4.2.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.2.
1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Racist insults have often been used to call out minorities who try to exercise free speech. Political correctness allows everybody to exercise free speech.
1.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: Being offensive can make people feel like they can't speak up, similar to how PC makes offensive people feel like they can't share their views, except innocent people who have legitimate concerns are being targeted. Because of this, it seems likely that political correctness helps free speech more than it hinders.
1.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.1.4.3.3.1.1.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Most humans already restrict their own speech voluntarily because they have experienced the negative effects of sharing one's unfiltered thoughts when they were hurtful and not constructive. Complete honesty can prevent harmony and cooperation and ruin relationships.
1.4.2.5. Pro: Making Holocaust denial illegal, as [many nations do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial), is of greater benefit to society because of the [historical and cultural significance of the event](https://academic.oup.com/gh/article-abstract/31/1/61/624491?redirectedFrom=fulltext).
1.4.2.5.1. Con: PC encompasses a much broader dimension compared to the Holocaust.
1.4.2.5.2. Con: Comparing political correctness with Holocaust denial is a [false equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence), because PC is not as culturally significant and a lot less important than the Holocaust.
1.4.2.6. Pro: In a [defensive democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_democracy), members of a democracy believe it is necessary to limit some speech in order to protect and perpetuate a democratic government.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: The [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance), [expressed by Karl Popper](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/25998-the-so-called-paradox-of-freedom-is-the-argument-that-freedom), gives an example of how, if a society that is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.
1.4.2.6.1.1. Con: He was not, in general, in favor of suppressing intolerant speech.
1.4.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: For Popper, as long as no one is bringing "[fists and guns](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/liggio-literature-of-liberty-autumn-1980-vol-3-no-3/simple)", rational argument should be the preferred default.
1.4.2.6.1.1.2. Con: Abusive speech goes beyond what rational argument was intended to counter, and thus should not be tolerated. Those resorting to abusive speech are not participating in rational debate but attempting to galvanize the troops and gain support, which cannot be allowed in a civilized society.
1.4.2.6.1.1.3. Pro: Popper [claimed](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/25998-the-so-called-paradox-of-freedom-is-the-argument-that-freedom), “In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise."
1.4.2.7. Pro: Not all thought and expression are beneficial to society. Absolute freedom of speech would permit racism, hence some level of political correctness is beneficial to society.
1.4.2.7.1. Pro: And according to the [OHCHR](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx), "any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere".
1.4.2.7.2. Con: On the contrary, political correctness stimulates racism. If people are reluctant and afraid to express their thoughts, which may be ignorant, wrong, etc. nobody can correct or ridicule them [\(an echo chamber\)](https://ncase.me/crowds). The ability to do so is important in order to prevent bad ideas becoming bad actions.
1.4.2.7.3. Con: PC goes too far: subjects or points of view which the speaker thinks could potentially be offensive to the set audience at the set time is off the table.
1.4.2.8. Con: This is the driving force of [dictatorships and authoritarian regimes](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/05/dictatorship-defaults), because they often create an inhospitable environment for free speech.
1.4.2.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.7.3.1.
1.4.2.8.2. Pro: [Authoritarian regimes in the Middle East](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/05/dictatorship-defaults) frequently curtail free speech.
1.4.2.9. Pro: Political correctness only shuts down speech which insults, marginalises, or excludes people without a valid reason, which is a type of hate speech. If people cannot argue without using hate speech, they have nothing real to argue. If they can argue without hate speech, political correctness will not shut them down.
1.4.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.
1.4.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.6.
1.4.3. Con: Fighting against insulting speech is not attacking free speech.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Insulting and marginalizing stereotypes are not important aspects of free speech. Removing insults and stereotypes does not limit free speech in any way.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Whether something is important or not is not relevant when one asks if free speech is at all limited by something.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Political correctness does not limit thoughts or speech topics, it merely influences a way of speaking demanding that claims are done respectfully and avoid mental shortcuts \(a.k.a stereotypes\).
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: According to [the Cato 2017 Free Speech and Tolerance Survey](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america), nearly 6 in 10 Americans report that the “political climate” these days prevents them from saying what they believe “because others might find them offensive.”
1.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: America needs PC if 6/10 people aren't sure how to not offend people.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: Freedom of expression and respect for others are not mutually exclusive. Political correctness has been misunderstood as an attempt to censor our beliefs, but really, it is about the importance of respecting others regardless of differing views.
1.4.3.1.2.3. Con: Not all mental shortcuts are stereotypes. If someone looks like a woman, then you are right to assume that that person is a woman.
1.4.3.1.2.3.1. Con: All mental shortcuts based on perceptions/experiences are stereotypes. ["Stereotypes are not bugs in our cultural software but features of our biological hardware. This is because the ability to stereotype is often essential for efficient decision-making, which facilitates survival...you don’t ask a toddler for directions, you don’t ask a very old person to help you move a sofa, and that’s because you stereotype.”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201809/stereotype-accuracy-displeasing-truth) An assumption that a person is a woman is based on their looks is stereotyping.
1.4.3.1.2.3.2. Con: Demanding that people speak in a way that respectfully acknowledges that there are exceptions-to-the-average, or points out the errors in assumptions and shortcuts is not a limit. It points out limitations/inaccuracies.
1.4.3.1.2.3.2.1. Con: It limits how one 'should' speak.
1.4.3.1.2.3.3. Con: The person may be dressed in [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_\(clothing\)).
1.4.3.1.2.3.3.1. Con: Very few people are dressed like the opposite sex. An even smaller number also disguises other indicators like facial appearance.
1.4.3.2. Pro: PC doesn't limit any practical free speech.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.6.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: "Practical speech" can't be pinned down by a single group. This is why the plus exists at the end of LGBTQ+. There is no way to completely exhaust the possibilities. This is a practical compromise.
1.4.3.3. Pro: As long as there are PC alternatives, it doesn't restrict speech. It actually encourages people to [learn](https://hbr.org/2006/09/rethinking-political-correctness) vocabulary and behavior awareness.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.1.1.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Part of free thought constitutes the suggestions found in PC culture. To prohibit PC culture in society would be to close that area of deliberation, thereby threatening free speech even further.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: If people advocate banning PC culture because they want more free thought and open criticism, they should not have a problem with being criticized for their choice of words. Yet they do not wish to hear such criticism. This is a paradox.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: The idea here isn't about prohibition of PC culture, it asks if PC culture is detrimental. Suggesting something may be harmful, as it pertains to free speech is not suggesting the prohibition of PC culture. This may only pertain to an extremist subset of PC culture.
1.4.3.4.4. Pro: Being free to constructively criticize a speech that one believes to be harmful \(or not politically correct\) is also freedom of speech.
1.4.3.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.6.
1.4.3.5. Con: We should seek to protect all speech, including the distasteful, to protect individuality and the rights of the individual over the group. This ensures the freedom of expression and in the worst instances, helps identify those to whom we might prefer to distance ourselves.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.2.
1.4.3.6. Pro: Political Correctness is separate from the idea of free speech. Political Correctness takes place between citizens, while free speech [protects the individual from government censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties).
1.4.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.
1.4.3.8. Con: In order for speech to be unlimitedly free, it must be free to be insulting.
1.4.3.8.1. Con: If true and absolute free spech was the goal, then people should not take issue with PC viewpoints, as those would also be covered by "truly free" speech. Trying to invalidate certain viewpoints because they allegedly threaten free speech is also threatening free speech.
1.4.3.8.1.1. Con: One does not necessarily have to invalidate PC to call it detrimental.
1.4.3.8.1.2. Con: Similarly, one could call speech invalidating PC to be part of free speech.
1.4.3.8.2. Con: A maximum of personal freedom is not possible, because it always comes at the cost of restricting another person's freedom.
1.4.3.8.2.1. Pro: From the [ICCPR](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/background-paper-human-rights-cyberspace/4-permissible-limitations-iccpr-right-freedom), the concept of free speech may be limited to ensure the rights and reputation of others. Political correctness usually fights against insults that involve discrimination, which is [a specific example](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/background-paper-human-rights-cyberspace/4-permissible-limitations-iccpr-right-freedom#fnB46) of this limitation.
1.4.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: This is still called free speech by the two [main](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/) [online](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech) encyclopedias.
1.4.3.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [notes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#IntBouDeb) that "The first thing to note in any sensible discussion of freedom of speech is that it will have to be limited. Every society places some limits on the exercise of speech because it always takes place within a context of competing values."
1.4.3.8.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.8.2.1.1.1.
1.4.3.8.2.3. Pro: There are spaces such as [courtrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court) where speaking out of turn can land one in prison, yet this is not regarded as a limitation of freedom of speech.
1.4.3.8.2.3.1. Pro: When a person complains of free speech restrictions only when the person being insulted is a marginalized person or community and not when the receiver is a powerful entity \(e.g., a court of law\), their complaints can be disregarded as disingenuous.
1.4.3.8.3. Con: This is a misinterpretation of the concept of Freedom of Speech. As the [Stanford Encyclopedia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#IntBouDeb) states, "Free speech is simply a useful term to focus our attention on a particular form of human interaction and the phrase is not meant to suggest that speech should never be limited."
1.4.3.8.4. Pro: The concept of free speech includes the ability to [purposefully insult people or ideas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/16/free-speech-means-nothing-without-right-to-offend-paris-copenhagen).
1.4.3.8.4.1. Pro: Self-expression through scorn/derision/contempt [has its place against bad governments.](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/05/the-necessity-of-political-vulgarity)
1.4.3.8.4.1.1. Con: This concerns the individual's right to speak against a government, system, or institution-- conceptual bodies which do not have unalienable rights. It is different when an individual speaks to another individual, because both people have the same unalienable rights.
1.4.3.8.4.1.1.1. Con: US Supreme Court case Citizens United ruled that [corporate personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood) grants corporations [free speech protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC#Majority_opinion). Corporations are institutions which have the same unalienable rights as individuals.
1.4.3.8.4.2. Pro: Satire is [protected](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1015/satire) by the free expression clause of the US Constitution's First Amendment.
1.4.3.8.4.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.8.2.1.
1.4.3.8.5. Con: For speech to be unlimitedly free, people would be allowed to call for violence, defame people, harass people, get away with swearing and talking about sex and drugs in front of kids, and get away with scams that involve convincing people to give you money.
1.4.3.8.6. Con: Free speech is beneficial when it is meaningful and productive. Insulting another person for who they are does not advance a discussion in any meaningful way.
1.4.3.9. Con: An example would be talking about the crime rate in black communities. For someone \(especially a Caucasian\) to merely bring it up -- even in a polite and civil manner -- can be very triggering to people. Out of fear of offending these people and being seen as a bigot, all comments that may put blame on the minority or put them in a negative light are avoided.
1.4.3.9.1. Con: Talking factually about crime in a community is not triggering. Blaming the cause of the crime on simply "being black" would blatant racism. Tying the crime to a racial stereotype would be as well. Whoever it is that is triggering people with the hypothetical polite statements probably doesn't even know they are being racist.
1.4.3.9.2. Pro: It is vital that logical fallacies be aired and revealed and challenged and supported if need be. All apparent fallacies must be analyzed to determine if they are actually fallacious. The alternative is falling into the “fallacy fallacy”, deciding that because something appears fallacious that it is dismissed out of hand.
1.4.3.9.3. Con: Censoring oneself out of fear of criticism & censoring oneself in order to spare someone's feelings do not violate one's free speech.
1.4.3.9.4. Con: The intent of bringing up crime rates in black communities is rarely to try to address the inequalities leading to them and more often to dilute and minimize black communities' problems and support racist talking points.
1.4.3.9.4.1. Pro: This rarely goes hand in hand with a full understanding of the sociopolitical context or a critical assessment of the origin and accuracy of the data.
1.4.4. Pro: Political correctness inhibits some forms of artistic creativity.
1.4.4.1. Pro: PC culture makes it hard to distinguish between satire and insulting language, which inhibits satirical expression.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Political culture has no impact on this distinguishability whatsoever, only the ability of the speaker to properly express themselves does.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Satire often has a very clear context \(like a TV show format\) so that it is easily distinguishable from statements made in earnest.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: A person can always claim what they said was meant to be ironic, sarcastic or satirical, with or without PC culture. You can't stop people from lying.
1.4.4.1.4. Pro: PC occasionally limits comedy, even as it is meant neither as a threat, nor denigration.
1.4.4.1.4.1. Pro: A comedian was forced to pay a lot of money to someone after making a [joke](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjaykq/a-canadian-comedian-was-ordered-to-pay-42000-because-he-insulted-a-child-with-a-disability) about them on stage.
1.4.4.1.4.1.1. Con: The [joke](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjaykq/a-canadian-comedian-was-ordered-to-pay-42000-because-he-insulted-a-child-with-a-disability) was about how he was a make a wish foundation kid but still alive, when he wasn't terminally ill, he got to sing in front of the pope because of his talent, not because make a wish foundation organised it. This was an attack on the kid's credibility, and we can't legalise defamation.
1.4.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Saying that his condition was just being ugly is more bullying than a joke.
1.4.4.1.4.2. Con: PC has little effect on comedy, just on who is singled out to be mocked in comedy. Poor decision making, absurd behavior, and bad luck are all rife for comedic mockery, but attaching those things to someone based upon some aspect of their race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. is not.
1.4.4.1.4.2.1. Con: PC does indeed [have an effect on comedy](https://www.salon.com/2015/06/10/10_famous_comedians_on_how_political_correctness_is_killing_comedy_we_are_addicted_to_the_rush_of_being_offended/). Comedians like [Jerry Seinfeld](https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2015/06/08/jerry-seinfeld-says-comedians-avoid-college-gigs-students-are-so-pc/37403583/) and [Chris Rock](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-college-students-prudes-comics-perspec-0204-20150203-column.html) no longer play at colleges due to PC culture.
1.4.4.1.4.3. Con: Comedians will continue making jokes, if people laugh at them or not is independent of their ability to make a joke.
1.4.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: The apparent [top ten](https://www.facebook.com/JimmyCarr/videos/1084792608539705/) most offensive Jimmy Carr jokes aren't politically incorrect.
1.4.4.1.4.4. Con: Most comedians can be funny without breaking political correctness. Even [Achmed the Dead Terrorist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBvfiCdk-jc) \(it has jokes about presumably Muslim suicide bomber\), stays politically correct and very funny.
1.4.4.1.5. Con: Well crafted satire has a target and aims to convey a message by over-stating it's opposite. If the satire in question does more to strengthen the position of it's target or strays from its aim, then its not satire. PC culture cannot change that. People understand satire when it is done well, for example, the work of [Stewart Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyGND49CBYk).
1.4.4.2. Con: If your creative work is affected in any way by "political correctness" have artwork that is not based on harming minorities or historically oppressed groups.
1.4.4.3. Con: [Research suggests](https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1921&context=articles) the opposite is the case in mixed-sex environments.
1.4.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.4.1.3.3.
1.4.5. Pro: PC stifles discourse by social sanctions that encourage individuals and institutions to [self-censor speech](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Glenn_Loury/louryhomepage/papers/Loury_Political_Correctness.pdf) and thought.
1.4.5.1. Con: Anti-PC is also a form of policing speech and attacking the words rather than the ideas. It is just done in a different way.
1.4.5.2. Con: This claim represents a fear of being criticized. Freedom of speech \(earnest discussion\) does not guarantee freedom from being criticized \(yet more earnest discussion\). Political correctness is about removing insulting language from the earnest discussion, not the concepts or the criticism.
1.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.2.1.
1.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.6.1.
1.4.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.3.2.
1.4.5.6. Pro: Political correctness discourages individuals from saying what they really think. It is beneficial to let people say what they want to say, so one can easily identify people who hold ideas they disagree with, and try to persuade them as to why they should think otherwise.
1.4.5.7. Pro: The 'social conventions' voluntarily adhered to through PC leads to self-censorship \([pg 430](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Glenn_Loury/louryhomepage/papers/Loury_Political_Correctness.pdf)\) through [paranoia](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/paranoia).
1.4.5.8. Con: Freedom of speech does [not](https://www.holyrood.com/comment/view,freedom-of-speech-does-not-mean-freedom-from-consequences_13800.htm?) mean freedom from criticism or backlash. It means not being persecuted or punished by law for voicing your thoughts. A person's right to free speech is not threatened by other people criticizing the person's words.
1.4.5.8.1. Con: Merriam-Webster's first [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/law) of law is literally "a binding custom or practice of a community." Political correctness, when enforced by social consensus, pretty straightforwardly fits this definition. Essentially, there is extremely little difference between "restrictive social consensus" and "restrictive law".
1.4.5.8.2. Con: Political correctness encourages censorship instead of criticism and controversial debates.
1.4.5.8.2.1. Con: People are quick to assume "censorship" when they are being attacked verbally or excluded from a conversation. While certainly not pleasant or constructive, this does not fulfill the definition of censorship.
1.4.5.8.2.2. Con: Political correctness includes no statement about concrete measures taken to enforce or encourage politically correct speech. The concept itself cannot be said to encourage censorship instead of criticism, as both censorship and criticism are potential ways to express it.
1.4.5.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.12.2.3.1.1.
1.4.5.9. Con: The backlash against PC culture, ridiculing every criticism of language as being "SJW" and "triggered" is also a form of trying to silence people and not conducive to healthy discourse either.
1.4.5.9.1. Con: The backlash against PC culture is not trying to silence the PC activist so much as to inform observers that the PC crowd are working toward an agenda or are overreacting to a perceived [trigger](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Triggered).
1.4.5.9.2. Con: This does work in both ways, but this is most likely a result of PC culture 'criminalizing' opposing viewpoints irrespective of their validity.
1.4.5.9.2.1. Con: This is basically a "but they started it" argument, which is not an actual argument, let alone a logical or constructive way to solve a conflict.
1.4.5.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.10.12.3.
1.4.5.11. Pro: As once said by clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson: "[In order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive](https://jordanpetersonquotes.com/order-able-think-risk-offensive/)". Political correctness is a direct attack on free speech, and you should only get in trouble for saying something offensive if it's meant as a threat or a vast public denigration to the person or group in case.
1.4.5.11.1. Con: Peterson says we all risk being offensive, and when we do, we should apologize and find a better way to say it. It does not mean that you should persist in being offensive after you know about it. PC is about learning what is and is not offensive.
1.4.5.11.2. Con: People should get in [trouble](https://www.cps.gov.uk/verbal-abuse-and-harassment-public) for bullying and harassing people, even if it is only by words.
1.4.5.11.3. Con: Unless there is a reason behind risking being offensive, it is àn appeal to authority logical fallacy.
1.4.5.11.4. Con: There is a difference between ideas that are offensive, and language that is unnecessarily inflammatory.
1.4.5.11.5. Con: One does not need to speak everything one thinks. Tactful speech allows one to make points without insulting listeners.
1.4.5.11.5.1. Pro: The [value of free speech](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/01/26/why-free-speech-fundamental/aaAWVYFscrhFCC4ye9FVjN/story.html) lies in the ability to question accepted ideas/hypotheses so that progress can be made \(Ex: the discovery that the Earth revolves around the sun rather than vice-versa\). Ideas can be expressed, supported with evidence, heard, considered, and discussed while following [guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order) \(Ex: no use of profanity, ideas which concern sex/race groups must be accompanied by scientific evidence\).
1.4.5.11.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.4.5.11.5.2. Con: To say that non-PC things need never be said is to undermine the [value of free speech](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/01/26/why-free-speech-fundamental/aaAWVYFscrhFCC4ye9FVjN/story.html), which has been held up time and again as [foundational](https://fee.org/articles/three-reasons-free-speech-matters/) to [democracy](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-functions-of-the-five-foundations-of-democracy) in general and our society in particular. To attack a foundation of our society, [proves the initial point](https://www.britannica.com/topic/a-priori-knowledge) that PC is detrimental to society.
1.4.5.11.5.2.1. Con: "To attack a foundation of our society" is an exercise in free speech.
1.4.5.11.5.2.2. Con: Forcing PC doesn't undermine [free speech.](https://medium.com/humanist-voices/six-facts-free-speech-fundamentalists-love-to-ignore-8e0daa6fa78b)
1.4.5.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.7.2.
1.4.5.13. Pro: Political correctness sometimes sidelines the search for the truth.
1.4.5.13.1. Pro: Much like politicians, PC uses language for the sake of group solidarity.
1.4.5.13.2. Pro: PC resorts to what is perceived as [virtue signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling), posturing and condescension. It would seem to be an [appeal to character](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/eng207-td/Lines%20of%20Arg/ethos.htm) rather than an direct expression of moral virtue.
1.4.6. Pro: PC stifles and censors discourse.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Political correctness leads to the [banning of books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_commonly_challenged_books_in_the_United_States) and ideas that differ from our own. This damages growth in knowledge.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #26865: Banning or removing access to books is inherently wrong.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: "Ideas that differ from our own" in this case means ideas that condone racism in the five books that might have been banned because of political correctness.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.2.3.1.2.
1.4.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.4.1.
1.4.6.3. Con: [Political correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) is not a set of regulations, it is the action of avoiding language or behaviour that could be perceived as "excluding, marginalizing, or insulting" groups of people.
1.4.7. Con: PC should not be considered to harm free speech.
1.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.7.2. Con: Free speech is the basis to the freedom we enjoy in the west. Nothing is worth comprimising this.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.8.1.
1.4.7.2.2. Con: Abusive speech is a threat to free speech as its baseless hostility provokes a response. This backlash could compromise the spirit of Free Speech protections as collateral damage. Attacking abusive speech is not a compromise, to not attack abusive speech will compromise free speech.
1.4.7.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.3.
1.4.7.3. Pro: It's easy to use the free speech defence when [you're not the one paying for it](https://www.facebook.com/thefeedsbsviceland/posts/826992894301085?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA8GyMN4PQqmn_Z8CugJUV_xcnpSnVhuFV78FQXqjOGW3BmV6bxlQkKTVf61hdeTaqR31aMalA_4Bj9rlvlmszUyheJIdvz3D65-oEmbVqAuMfj7PV8YdGU9BiSW-1jtWQLKnJgG1J5eUkn3TM0fnDVae2I8W2w61pS5tom265uMud6QuZxHadAw1tzsvjcmS_P2W6fnIi9ZniFlR7B4p6_zRXOkBRo8wVGKst_ZyHUDhrwCsj-hCv9a_GAIn1-bDVRLILc_QL3WKScyg5NgQXJ2S7T-a5sE3WjrzlN6q1yiOjTeh-YIL-V1PvJPboGQAxGqmOsm9mvH3EqrDqh1kLOGvmRAZz7gn2RvQxZDIgy870RRkktUWuHWzcA&__tn__=C-R).
1.4.7.4. Con: [Liberty and equality](https://philosophynow.org/issues/110/Liberty_and_Equality) will always be in tension with each other and PC favors equality at the expense of liberty. The degree to which it does this varies by individual and the way PC is defined.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: PC advocates insist PC is creating equality. “Forced equality” is self-contradictory because the person being forced and the person doing the forcing plainly have unequal amounts of power. In the case of PC, much of its [power is derived from the public shaming](https://itself.blog/2015/07/03/public-shaming-as-a-political-strategy/) of it's targets.
1.4.7.4.2. Pro: Defending the rights of LGBT+ will necessarily run afoul of many cultures in which homophobia is entrenched in custom and religious values. Activists must be able to speak frankly and sometimes forcefully to assert the rights of LGBT+, which will necessarily require perceived insult to these cultures. PC and polite speech will slow moral progress.
1.4.7.4.2.1. Con: If some religion is oppressing some portion of the population, it's coherent with PC and with self-defense that the discriminated group of people should be able to label them as necessary.
1.4.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: One could argue that this religion is actively discriminating people, and PC people are against systemic oppressions like this one. There is a concept called ["axes of oppression"](https://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/139052/_PARENT/CC_layout_details/false) when talking about intersectionality, in which you can be oppressing some people while you're oppressed by others.
1.4.7.4.2.1.2. Pro: One could argue that labeling your oppressors as "people that discriminate against X" is not an insult, it's stating the truth. Insults have the goal of harming people, and this has the goal of self-defense, protecting yourself.
1.4.7.4.2.1.3. Con: In practice, the PC stance on speech isn't compatible with defending against the intolerance of minority oppressor groups.
1.4.7.4.2.1.4. Pro: Those individuals with a dislike of, or prejudice against homosexual people are labelled as [homophobes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia).
1.4.7.4.3. Pro: Speaking out cultures that endorse barbaric practices promotes equality for women at the expense of the traditional values and liberties of these cultures.
1.4.7.4.3.1. Pro: As a feminist, one must [oppose female genital mutilation, arranged/forced marriages](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jul/24/patriarchy-child-marriage-female-genital-mutilation-fgm-feminism), prohibition of females attending school and [draconian dress codes](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/school-dress-codes-are-problematic/410962/). Thus, PC must be trodden on in favor of equality for women.
1.4.7.5. Pro: Political correctness helps people in respecting the laws that govern free speech.
1.4.7.6. Pro: A [study showed](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/01/30/382475295/what-research-says-about-the-consequences-of-p-c-culture) that when a group of people trying to brainstorm ideas is primed with a "PC norm", the group went on to generate more ideas, and more novel ideas. By imposing a PC environment, the researchers made it easier for men and women to speak their minds in mixed company.
1.4.7.7. Pro: Anyone who doesn't use discriminatory language won't lose any speech from political correctness.
1.4.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.4.
1.4.7.8. Con: -> See 1.4.5.11.5.2.
1.4.8. Con: The narrative that people with opposing opinions are being silenced systematically, that certain thoughts and ideas are forbidden etc. is contradictory to the fact that anti-PC advocates have huge platforms for voicing their criticism, especially social media, sometimes even national television. Discourse is therefore not stifled.
1.4.9. Con: This depends on an extremely narrow understanding of freedom. If some groups feel marginalised by the prevalence of some forms of expression, this can inhibit the freedom of people in these groups to a greater extent than restricting the use of such speech in the first place.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Racist discourse, for example, contributes to the [economic and social disadvantage of minorities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915460/), thus restricting the freedom of these groups.
1.4.10. Pro: Freedom of speech and expression is constitutionally protected in [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country).
1.4.10.1. Pro: In the [United States](https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/freedom-of-speech), the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and guarantees the right to express ideas and information.
1.4.10.2. Pro: Under Article 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998, “everyone has the right to freedom of expression” in the [UK](https://www.theweek.co.uk/97552/hate-speech-vs-free-speech-the-uk-laws).
1.4.11. Pro: Terminology evolves and language is fluid, that is good. But many in the political arena use the changes to hijack an argument and redirect it away from the main point. e.g If you have a viewpoint about Israel and Palestine you have to select your words very carefully to avoid being lumped in with Hitler as anti-semite.
1.4.11.1. Pro: Often some countries 'adopt' a label more quickly than others. We should accept that as well-meant fashion rather than fundamental differences. For example we in the UK are often behind the US when describing people of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity \(or at least I am\) but that should not stop us sharing concerns about police killing Black people.
1.4.12. Pro: Political Correctness prevents diverging opinions from what is considered politically correct from being voiced through social pressure.
1.4.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1.
1.4.14. Con: It is our society's ["call out"](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/13/601971617/the-callout) or "cancel" culture that is responsible for the stifling of free thought.  It is possible to promote political correctness effectively and politely.
1.4.14.1. Pro: [Call-in culture](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-call-in-mean-when-call-out-culture-feels-toxic-this-method-can-be-used-instead-9056343) promotes PC without some of the pitfalls of call-out culture.
1.4.14.1.1. Con: Call-in is a great way to go but doesn't seem to have the same traction as call-out culture. The article mentions the "performative" nature of call-out, which attracts some looking for credibility and status in a community. Call-in doesn't have the same social payout.
1.4.14.2. Pro: The current culture of aggressively and vehemently calling out "PC violators" as opposed to offering constructive criticism is detrimental to allowing "offenders" to learn from mistakes and grow as people - and in some instances \(especially when the violation took place some length of time ago\), ignores the fact that the person in question has already done exactly that.
1.4.14.2.1. Con: This is victim blaming. It is not the job of minorities to educate people on how to express themselves in a respectful manner. It can be asked of every citizen to familiarize themselves with current social movements and issues, especially with so much information readily available. Ignorance is not an excuse.
1.4.14.3. Con: If someone made an honest mistake saying or doing something offensive, it shouldn't be hard to prove exactly that and give an earnest apology. However, what the person said or did is often indicative of their actual racist/sexist/classist views, so they will defend or even repeat what they said/did. Harsher criticism is entirely justified here.
1.4.14.3.1. Con: It depends on the situation. The act of calling-out is often itself an attempt to gain status or otherwise engage in rivalries. This manifests itself in in-group purity battles which are definitionally toxic. This is a use of "PC" to engage in identity warfare and doesn't help anyone.
