Discussion Name: Is Christianity Compatible With Feminism?

1. Christianity is compatible with feminism.
1.1. Con: All Abrahamic religions have a few verses that may venerate women, but the majority of their laws and suggestions are condemnations, vilifying everything that a woman is and does; this includes Christianity.
1.1.1. Pro: Multiple accounts in the Bible support this position.
1.1.1.1. Pro: There are a wide range of passages in the Bible that discourage gender equality, such as [Genesis 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-16.html), [Colossians 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18&version=NIV), [1 Corinthians 11:3-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A3-10&version=NIV), [1 Corinthians 14:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14%3A34-35&version=NIV), [Deuteronomy 21:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+21%3A11-14&version=NIV), [Deuteronomy 22:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A5&version=NIV), [Timothy 2:9-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A9-15&version=NIV), [Ephesians 5:22-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-24&version=NIV) and [Peter 3:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-6&version=NIV).
1.1.1.2. Con: [Genesis 3:16](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm) describes the woman's judgment in the Fall as less severe than the man's.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The woman only suffers social submission to the man and physical pain in childbirth, whereas the man condemns the entirety of his descendants, both male and female, to a physical life of labor and a spiritual life of separation from God.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The judgment of Genesis 3:16 is balanced by the redemption of [Genesis 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A15&version=NIV), where the woman is redeemed by "her seed". The man is not offered similar balance in his judgment.
1.1.1.3. Con: [Deuteronomy 21:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+21%3A11-14&version=NIV) protected women taken in warfare from abuse by limiting the authority their captors had over them, ascribing the same value to them, and the same responsibilities to the husband, as was ascribed to wives not taken in war.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Deuteronomy 21:11 describes a situation not dissimilar to sex slavery: during a war a woman is taken from her family and forced to marry her captor. This is not compatible with any idea of consent, respect or feminism.
1.1.1.4. Con: These verses do not encompass a majority of the Biblical commandments, so this is not evidence of the above claim.
1.1.1.5. Con: Biblical teachings are same for both men and women.
1.1.1.5.1. Pro: [Deuteronomy 22:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A5&version=NIV) does not single out women, but commands social adherence to the clothing customs of both men and women.
1.1.1.5.2. Pro: [1 Timothy 2:9-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A9-15&version=NIV) is a commandment to modesty, not singling out women but offered in conjunction to a similar commandment made to men.
1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: [1 Timothy 2:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A13-14&version=NIV) justifies this modesty by agreeing with [Genesis 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A16&version=NIV) regarding the greater weight of the Fall being on the man than on the woman.
1.1.1.5.3. Pro: The context for [Ephesians 5:22-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-25&version=NIV) is given immediately prior, in verse 21, which describes mutual submission of both men and women to each other in mutual submission to the Lord.
1.1.1.5.3.1. Con: If mutal submission to the Lord is the intended meaning, there should be no need for wives to submit to their husbands, since the Lord sees them as equals.
1.1.1.5.4. Pro: [1 Peter 3:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-6&version=NIV) is a commandment to modesty that, while applying specifically to women, is offered in conjunction to a similar commandment to modesty offered to men in [1 Peter 2:13-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A13-25&version=NIV), as indicated by the "Likewise" that starts the chapter.
1.1.1.5.4.1. Con: [1 Peter 2:13-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A13-25&version=NIV) does not comment on modesty, but rather submitting to earthly authorities, and explicitly for slaves to submit to their masters, even cruel ones who may beat you. If wives are to "likewise" submit in this fashion to their husbands, this is literally instructing wives to let their husbands beat them.
1.1.1.6. Con: These Biblical teachings were in reference to the situation during that time, and should also be contrasted with other verses.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: [1 Corinthians 11:3-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A3-10&version=NIV) must be considered not only in context of the order of Creation \(alluded to here and described in [Genesis 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2&version=NIV)\) but also in context of verses 11 and 12, describing an interdependent unity of man and woman under God.
1.1.1.6.2. Pro: [1 Corinthians 14:34-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14%3A34-35&version=NIV) was referencing a specific dynamic in the church at Corinth at that time, where the women of the church were being divisive both with their husbands and with the congregation, contrary to the interdependent unity with their husbands that they were called to \(referenced in [1 Corinthians 11:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A11-12&version=NIV)\).
1.1.1.6.2.1. Con: There are no matching instructions for men. Additionally, [Corinthians 11:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A13-16&version=NIV) literally advises the women should pray with their heads covered, that men with long hair are disgraceful and the church has no time for anyone who argues otherwise.
1.1.1.7. Pro: A just and loving God would not condemn and order the subjugation of half his creations.
1.1.1.7.1. Pro: Lilith was [exiled from Eden](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/neeqgw/praise-lilith-a-chill-demon-cast-from-eden-for-refusing-missionary-position) and left out of the Bible for being too strong willed.
1.1.1.7.1.1. Con: The story of Lilith is extra-biblical and not taught in most modern Christian churches, a selected story to present a narrow view of biblical teachings about women.
1.1.1.7.2. Pro: Lot's wife was turned to a [pillar of salt for looking back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot%27s_wife) at Sodom.
1.1.1.7.2.1. Con: Lot's wife is a cautionary tale on fixating on past events.
1.1.1.7.3. Pro: Eve's sin is allegedly the [Biblical 'curse'](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/bible-evangelicals-womanhood-marriage/508076/) on all of womankind.
1.1.2. Con: Christians literally believe that [Mary is the mother of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus). She is worshipped and loved as an example of perfection when it comes to womanhood and motherhood.
1.1.2.1. Con: This is a sectarian belief \(specifically Catholic\) which venerates a glorified presentation of Mary for the purpose of intercession, that is for the fact "[she has Jesus' ear](https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2017/03/the-conception-of-christ-through-ear-of.html)", rather than for her own personal teachings, virtues or intrinsic value. This is pedestalling at its finest and is contrary to the principles of feminist equality.
1.1.3. Con: St. Thomas [referred](http://courses.washington.edu/hsteu305/Aquinas%20and%20Aristotle%20on%20Women.htm), based on the Bible, that women and man have the same rights, since Eve was made of Adam's rib. Not his head \(it would make women more powerful than man\) and not his foot \(it would make her less important\). This goes exactly with feminism.
1.1.3.1. Con: That man was created by God, and women only fashioned from a part of man, makes men primary and women secondary, men fundamental and women derivative. This is directly contrary to feminism.
1.1.4. Pro: The divinely ordained female inferiority to men outlined in [1 Corinthians 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14&version=NIV) wasn't written to be applicable exclusively to a narrow context from antiquity, but was instead derived from the universal 'divine order' of [Genesis 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2&version=NIV) - an order that is binding upon every Church across every time and place. This worldview is inherently incompatible with feminism.
1.1.5. Con: The "condemnations" that Christianity offers women do not single women out but are offered in conjunction with similar -- and often greater -- condemnations of men.
1.1.6. Con: Women are empowered in Islam.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Women are given all of their rights and not exploited in Islam.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The most esteemed human in Islam, and the one given more rights than anyone else, is a mother.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: The famous story underpinning the famous Hadith goes: A person came to [Messenger of Allah](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:316) and asked, "Who among people is most deserving of my fine treatment?" He said, "Your mother".
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: In terms of the Arabic language, ‘mother’ means the origin of everything. The expression, "The Essence \(literally: the Mother\) of the Book" occurs in the Noble Quran in this sense \[[Quran 3:7](https://quran.com/3/7?translations=27,18,17,95,101,84,21,22,85,20,19) – [13:39](https://quran.com/13/39-43?translations=20) – [43:4](https://quran.com/43/4-10)\]
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: The mother solely deserves the ever-best of treatment. A narration about the Prophet says: A Muslim came to him and asked, "[Allah's Messenger, who amongst the people is most deserving of my good treatment? He said: Your mother, again your mother, again your mother, then your father, then your nearest relatives according to the order \(of nearness](https://sunnah.com/Muslim/45/2)\)."
1.1.7. Con: Women are respected in Islam.
1.1.8. Pro: The Bible has multiple references to the "[seductress](https://www.biblestudytools.com/msg/proverbs/passage/?q=proverbs+5:3-22)" and advises men to avoid such women, yet there is no mention of philandering men.
1.1.8.1. Pro: King David had [multiple wives](https://www.learnreligions.com/davids-many-wives-in-bible-117324) and [several concubines](https://margmowczko.com/davids-ten-concubines/), yet he was considered "[a man after God's own heart](https://mountaineagle.com/stories/was-david-really-a-man-after-gods-own-heart,24231)." This is sexist hypocrisy.
1.2. Con: The Christian faith is diametrically opposed to women being free to control their own lives or the lives of men.
1.2.1. Con: Christianity supports monogamy, which is highly compatible with feminism.
1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that a specific tenet is compatible with feminism does not make a religion as a whole compatible.
1.2.1.2. Con: Christianity also outlines when it is [morally justifiable to cut off your wife's hand](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+25%3A11-12&version=NIV).
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: True Christians believe that the Bible is literally true, and it says that women are the property of the men in their lives and should have no self agency. This is antithetical to feminism.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It is not true that Bible literalism is the one true form of Christianity. Nobody can say that people who consider the Bible to be metaphorical aren't really Christians.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The bible states in [Genesis 2:18-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A18-24&version=NIV) that Adam needed a helper, so Eve was created from Adam's rib. It can be inferred from this that a woman was created to help a man, and that she is a lesser being because she was merely formed from a small piece of man.
1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: There are other denominations of Christianity that believe that the first telling of the story of Adam and Eve \(in the King James Bible at least\) is the true telling, whereas the second version is included for comparison between the spiritual and material Man.
1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: The word for helper, "[ezer](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5828.htm)," does not imply inferiority. In several parts of the Bible, the same root word is used to describe God's role towards his people.
1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: [Ephesians 5:22-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV) does tell women to submit to their husbands, but also says that husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it, and husbands are to love their wives as himself for they are united as one body.
1.2.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: This reveals the impossibility of following the Bible perfectly because it contradicts itself. Therefore, Christians must look for the deeper meanings in the Bible that override specific passages. Feminism is part of a deeper meaning.
1.2.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Ephesians 5:22-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV) implores husbands to love their wives as themselves, and viewing someone as an equal is necessary to loving them as you would love yourself. This message of love and equality directly contradicts the passage telling women to submit to their husbands.
1.2.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There is no contradiction if we see submission in the light of Christ as the embodiment of submission. Christ by nature had authority and dominion overall yet chose sacrificial love. He laid himself down to put ahead of himself the betterment of others. This is the same image used to describe how husbands should behave.
1.2.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Both directives are the same message but worded differently however a patriarchal society used these versus to dominate women rather than to force themselves to submit in love.
1.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: The Christian Bible is full of comments which condemn women to a secondary state. For a Bible-following Christian, women wouldn't be equal to men and feminism would be anathema.
1.2.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Christ reaffirmed this definition of marriage in [Matthew 19:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A1-11&version=NIV). In Genesis we can see God Himself declaring that Adam shall rule over Eve, and so Christ did not repeal this law. Nor is this law under the Old Covenant, for the Old Covenant was not even made until Abraham. It's still applicable to all Christians.
1.2.1.2.1.4.2. Con: Non-evangelical New Testament [scholars generally believe](https://bible.org/seriespage/9-what-does-it-mean-not-teach-or-have-authority-over-men-1-timothy-211-15) that all [three pastoral epistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral_epistles) \(1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus\) were written by an unknown person in Paul’s name long after he was dead. While this unknown author admired Paul and wanted to use his authority, he also contradicted Paul.
1.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: The “true Paul” taught that in Christ there is neither male nor female \([Galatians 3:28](https://netbible.org/bible/Galatians+3:28?ref=nbt)\).
1.2.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: [Timothy 2:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A11-14&version=NIV): "A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. Do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner."
1.2.1.2.1.5. Pro: The Bible states that [a raped woman should marry her rapist and that the rapist should pay the girl's father fifty shekels of silver](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut+22%3A28-29&version=NASB).
1.2.1.2.1.5.1. Con: While it is horrible to expect the victim to be forced to marry her rapist, the purpose of this law is to make sure that if she is pregnant from the rape, that the man takes responsibility for his actions. In that culture, no one else would want a raped woman. This is to guarantee that someone at least takes care of her. The New Testament nullifies this law as well.
1.2.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Many of the Old Testament rules, \(detailed in books such as Deuteronomy\) are [no longer relevant to modern Christianity](https://jdgreear.com/blog/why-dont-we-follow-all-of-the-old-testament-laws/). For example the law forbidding eating shellfish.
1.2.1.2.1.6. Con: A 'true' Christian is debatable. If it means a follower of Christ, his words and actions, then many who would identify this way do not always agree with a literal translation and certainly do not believe women are the property of men.
1.2.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: To call only people that take the Bible absolutely literally 'true Christians' is discriminatory.
1.2.1.2.1.7. Con: To read the Bible literally is to make a mistake in genre. The Bible is not a science textbook, there is room for interpretation and substitutions. The proper genre the bible falls into is a collection of faith stories & histories. As such, it is fraught with contradictions and different viewpoints.
1.2.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: A simple read-through of the Bible shows that this is the case. These writings were not intended to coalesce with each other but rather are the record of different communities in different times giving witness to God's presence. Consider that there are two creation stories: which is correct? Consider the history laid out by 1 and 2 Kings versus 1 and 2 Chronicles versus Judges. There are differences in the text that come from the perspective of the compiler of the narrative.
1.2.1.2.1.7.2. Pro: Take for instance, the gospel of John which says "[I write these things so that you may believe](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A31&version=NIV)", or Mark who says "[this is the beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-1.html)." Statements like these clue us in to the genre of writing that makes up the bible.
1.2.1.2.1.7.3. Con: If it is true that the Bible is a genre of writing that contains many contradictions and different points of view, it is Procrustean to claim that the Bible supports or does not support feminism. It unfortunately does both. Often it leans sorely toward not supporting it.
1.2.1.2.1.7.4. Con: Large parts of the bible are clearly and explicitly prescriptive. Chapters of the old testament are a compendium of laws allegedly commanded by God, and these clearly command a non-feminist-compatible status of women in society.
1.2.1.2.1.8. Con: Its compatibility depends on whether Christianity takes the path that views the Bible as a never-ending story of progress towards greater love and compassion.
1.2.1.2.1.8.1. Con: Feminism isn't about greater love and compassion, so whether the Bible is or not is irrelevant to it's compatibility with feminism.
1.2.1.2.1.8.1.1. Pro: Feminism is about 'empowerment of women,' love and compassion have nothing to do with power.
1.2.1.2.1.8.1.2. Con: Feminism and Christianity do not need to have the exact same goals to be compatible. Their goals only needs to not contradict.
1.2.1.3. Con: Christianity advocates patriarchal possessive monogamy, where "the husband is the head of the wife as... wives should submit to their husbands in everything" \([Ephesians 5:22-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-24&version=NIV)\), which is fundamentally incompatible with feminism.
1.2.1.4. Con: Monogamy is not necessarily feminist. Some feminists support [polygamy](https://sputniknews.com/viral/201710061058009812-sweden-feminism-polygamy/) or [open relationships](https://jezebel.com/5339211/is-non-monogamy-a-feminist-relationship-choice).
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Monogamy is for both sexes. If men were to be able to have many wives or if women were to be able to have many husbands, the argument could be made that Christianity is against feminism, as it would be unequal. The fact that the teaching is that each should have the same amount \(one partner\) is what makes Christianity and feminism compatible.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: There are many forms of polygamy and the assumption that all polygamy is based on unfairness is a form of bigotry.
1.2.1.5. Con: A monogamous marriage is no insurance against misogyny, unfortunately.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: Nothing could insure against misogyny.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Just because a relationship is between only one woman and one man, it doesn't stop the man to think of himself as superior and to expect his wife to be submissive. Feminism is about gender equality, not about monogamous relationships.
1.2.1.6. Pro: Christianity supports monogamy for both men and women. It stops men from cheating on women which is good for women, and therefore compatible with feminism.
1.2.1.6.1. Con: In the given example men are in the more powerful position. So that would not be categorized as feminism.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: This suggests that feminism is somehow "about men cheating on women".
1.2.1.6.2. Con: Monogamy does not stop men from cheating on women, or vice versa.
1.2.1.6.3. Con: If a pair of individuals move from being strangers to being in a monogamous relationship, the monogamy creates an opportunity to cheat where before there was none. From this perspective, monogamy creates an opportunity to cheat where before there was none.
1.2.2. Con: This is due to a [patriarchal attitude that exists globally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) - in religious or non religious societies.
1.2.2.1. Con: Religious doctrines, dogma and texts are presented as above subjective influence. Religions suggest that human culture does not dictate their beliefs and practices contrary to the above assertion.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Paul's rejection of women preachers could have been with reference to the real limitations of the women of his time. Since the society Paul was writing about was sexist, and women has less opportunities, it's unlikely any of them would have been qualified to preach. However, now that more opportunities are open to women, women are just as capable as men and therefore should be able to preach.
1.2.3. Con: We need to delineate between Christian tradition and Christianity itself. The only teaching that is essential to being Christian is [belief in Christ](https://uri.org/kids/world-religions/christian-beliefs). Given that Christ himself taught a message of inclusion that often addressed women directly in ways that contradicted the cultural norms at the time, we can see that Christian teaching is absolutely compatible with feminism.
1.2.3.1. Con: Christ did not explicitly condemn those norms, and some continued to be practiced or were in some ways expanded upon by his followers.
1.2.3.2. Con: This misrepresents Christianity, it's history, doctrines and influence in the world, which are not so simple or meaningless so as to be thrown aside for one statement of faith.
1.2.3.3. Con: Jesus taught that all of the laws of Moses needed to be followed and not ignored \([Matthew 5:17-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-20&version=NIV)\). One of these laws mandates a permanent, forced marriage between a virgin who has been raped and her attacker \([Deuteronomy 22:28-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A28-29&version=NIV)\). Since Jesus chose not to abolish the "Law" but uphold it, he and both books of the Bible are not compatible with feminism.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Christianity in the words of Christ is very egalitarian in all ways.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: The New Testament [Domestic Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament_household_code) written by Peter and Paul highlighting the role of husband/wife and father/child were impositions by Roman law and tradition - agreed to garner acceptance, then legality, then official adoption of Christianity by the Roman Empire. It had nothing to do with the teachings of Christ.
1.2.4. Pro: In Christianity, [only men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_orders_in_the_Catholic_Church) can receive ordination to the [diaconate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon) \(which is the "right" to become priests\), according to the Catholic and Orthodox churches teachings.
1.2.5. Con: The historical context for verses about women being unable to teach could be interpreted as specifically [going against the practices of former pagan priestesses being carried into Christian services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Timothy_2:12#Socio-cultural).
1.2.6. Pro: The Bible does not allow women to own property or decide who they will marry.
1.2.6.1. Con: [Proverb 31:16](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-16.htm) states, "She considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard."
1.2.6.2. Con: The Bible is split into Old and New Testaments. The New Testament does not create a governmental structure that allows or restrains people from buying property or choosing their marriage partner. This is done by Government, not religion.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: In the New Testament, there are people like [Lydia](https://margmowczko.com/new-testament-working-women/) who own their own businesses.
1.2.6.3. Pro: [Deuteronomy 22:28-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A28-29&version=NIV) gives women no say in the matter of their marriage, "If a man finds a girl who is a virgin, who is not engaged, and seizes her and lies with her and they are discovered, then the man who lay with her shall give to the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall become his wife because he has violated her; he cannot divorce her all his days."
1.2.6.3.1. Con: This law may have been put in place to protect the woman so that they are not left without a husband.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: This law would have been put into place so men might think twice before raping a woman if he had to take responsibility for her.
1.2.6.4. Con: Women are given opportunity to reject a marriage in the Bible. In [Genesis 24:58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+24&version=LEB) with Rebekah: "they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”"
1.2.6.4.1. Con: The fact that she was ostensibly given a choice does not change that, in practise, she may have been pressured into accepting whether she wished to or not.
1.2.6.4.2. Con: It can be granted that their ability to choose is obviously far more limited than that of a man.
1.2.6.5. Con: “If a man die, and have no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter” \([Numbers 27:8](https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-8.htm)\) and “Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry” \([Numbers 36:6](https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-6.htm)\) indicate otherwise.
1.2.6.5.1. Con: If women are only allowed to marry within their father's tribal clan, it limits their decision of who to marry.
1.2.7. Pro: [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Middle_Ages) [confirms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_patristic_age) that this is the way the Christian faith has always been interpreted.
1.2.7.1. Con: Christianity has a long history of adjusting itself to the cultures it wants to convert. Christmas is a prime example of that. Christians ignore the things in the Bible they find distasteful. The same should be the case about teachings concerning women.
1.2.8. Pro: A vast majority of Christian establishments and by extension, Christians all over the world, call for women to not be able to teach or have any authority over men and in fact call for the [submission](https://els.org/beliefs/doctrinal-statements/roles-of-men-and-women-in-the-church/) to men in [all things](http://aejt.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/395682/AEJT_2.18_Henderson_Tradition_and_the_Status_of_Women.pdf).
1.2.9. Pro: If a woman wants to be a pastor or she wants to get out of an abusive marriage, she should be able to do so without feeling any guilt towards her community and/or religion.
1.2.10. Pro: Women are not allowed to do certain thing because they use are emotions in what they speak. \([Timothy 2:8-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202%3A8-15&version=NIV)\)
1.2.11. Pro: Christianity - like all other abrahamitic religions - requires the negation of autonomy in order to serve a God, hence cannot be compatible with any system of ideas supporting autonomy like feminism.
1.3. Pro: Varying interpretations of the Bible are compatible with feminism.
1.3.1. Pro: Christianity is only accommodating to feminism now because so much of its theology has been flattened out by time, strife, and wealth. Word for word, all religions are antithetical to equality; it is only when they are no longer the principal force in individuals' lives that they become more accepting.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Many interpretations of the Old Testament \(before Christ\) were adapted to our time.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Christians today won't have to follow many interpretations, such as the 500+ [laws of Moses](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/law-of-moses?lang=eng).
1.3.2. Con: People practice religion in various ways to best suit their various needs. So, a person can be a 'Christian Feminist' by ignoring the parts of their religion that conflict with and/or outright prevent equality.
1.3.2.1. Pro: There are Christian feminists.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Christian feminists range from people like Barack Obama to [Mariana Thomson Folsom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Thompson_Folsom).
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Just as you can be gay and Christian, you can also be a feminist and Christian. One does not mean it supports the other.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: According to the Catholic Church one [cannot be Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_homosexuality) if they are gay.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: People have [conflicting beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) all the time.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The existence of conflict does not necessarily preclude compatibility.
1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Political conflict within and between societies occurs within a general context of cooperation and co-existence.
1.3.2.1.4. Con: There are also Christians who are not feminists, so this proves nothing.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Con: It does prove that Christianity is compatible with feminism. If it wasn't, there couldn't be Christian feminists.
1.3.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Human beings do not always follow the 'rules', just because a Christian feminist exists does not mean that feminism and Christianity are compatible.
1.3.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Ideologies are not neatly and rigidly defined by a certain specific set of "rules." Interpretations within one ideology can differ and still be valid.
1.3.2.1.4.1.2. Con: People are not omniscient nor are they always stating the truth. The very fact that people can both lie as well as not fully grasp the consequences or meaning of their beliefs as well as actions makes it that this correlation holds no appreciable weight to it.
1.3.2.1.5. Con: That is not an argument. There are black Nazies and antisemitic Jews.
1.3.2.2. Con: But by that reasoning, all religions are compatible with feminism. Saying that no religion is compatible with feminism because you would have to ignore other parts of the religion doesn't make any sense, because religion is about the individual and how they live their lives, especially in relation to others.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: People rarely follow the doctrine of the religion that they believe in, most pick and choose which follows their needs and wants.
1.3.2.3. Con: Regardless of one's beliefs in feminism, anytime one has to reinterpret a religious doctrine to make it compatible, they are no longer dealing with the original belief, but altering it. This removes what most would call the authenticity from which its authority derives, and also be considered as blasphemous.
1.3.2.3.1. Con: People do not follow the Old Testament as closely as they would the New Testament because our modern day values conflict with the values of the Old Testament.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: Saying that any reinterpretation is blasphemous would eliminate most religious people from their faith while also not making so much sense as the Bible has been rewritten countless times.
1.3.2.4. Con: While some branches of Christianity have historically been used to justify certain sexist practices or beliefs, Christianity can be reformed or interpreted in such a way as to support feminism, so it is not inherently incompatible.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: This 'reinterpretation' would just be ignoring the parts that conflict with equality, just as the grandparent claims.
1.3.2.5. Pro: Politicians who flout their Christianity insist that [women are not allowed to make choices about their own body](https://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/abortion/florida-supreme-court-reminds-politicians-women-are-capable), such as whether or not to get an abortion. They say this decision to deny women the right to choose is because of their faith.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: That is a commentary on those individuals and not the faith system they 'flout'.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Women have been historically [oppressed in the name of faith](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24801355).
1.3.3. Pro: Christianity is the most oft '[cherry-picked](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-defense-of-cherry-pick_b_7305860)' Abrahamic religion. At its core \(fundamentals\), it is not.
1.3.4. Pro: Christianity is [morally neutral](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13803600701473489). One can fill its emptiness with any ethics they like.
1.3.5. Pro: Christianity and its many branches are based off varying interpretations of what is perceived as God's word. Among these interpretations can be the inclusiveness of feminism in the Christian agenda, as in principle, the definition of Christianity is [flexible](http://www.generationword.com/notes_for_notesbooks_pg/basics/Flexibility.htm).
1.3.6. Con: If you can laud some parts of the Bible as inspired, and reject other parts as "of its time," and you have no criteria for making these choices other than your own \(or your priest's\) moral sense, then there is no need for Christianity at all, because you are following your own moral compass, and not the Bible's.
1.3.7. Con: If the Bible is, at least selectively, a book "of its time," then Christianity, too, may also be considered "of its time," and therefore, not applicable to modern morality.
1.3.8. Con: The fact that some who identify as Christian selectively ignore parts of the bible does not prove that Christianity, as a doctrine, is compatible with feminism; it only demonstrates that some Christians can be feminists by selectively ignoring biblical teachings, which is already self evident.
1.3.8.1. Con: Christianity, as a religion, is supposed to be practised to better the lives of those around us. The fact that the Bible was written [2,000 years ago](http://www.generationword.com/notes_for_notesbooks_pg/basics/Flexibility.htm) needs to be taken into account. We live in a modern society, where the rules are different, but 'Christian values' are inherently the same.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: The values are not the same, the New Testament and Old Testament have [fundamentally different values](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1195183.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A0c22f2645128806d5ce4d7a00ee5f47c).
1.3.8.2. Con: Fundamentalism, Bible literalism or other dogmas are still just various factions within Christianity. Countless Christians have never subscribed to any such notion and those who do are often recognized as extremists by some other Christians.
1.3.8.3. Con: Doctrine by definition is "[a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a Church, political party, or other group](https://www.lexico.com/definition/doctrine)". Going by that definition, one must take modern popular practices and teachings into account rather than relying on literal interpretation which is practiced by very few.
1.3.8.3.1. Con: The common thread of Christians is that they practice the doctrine of Christianity to varying degrees and with differing interpretations. Popular practices \(many involving ignoring said doctrine\) not taught by every denomination paint an inaccurate picture of Christianity as a whole and at its core beliefs.
1.3.9. Pro: Christianity is practiced in [thousands of different ways](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity) and vast numbers of Christians understand that the Bible is both a divine inspiration and a book of its time.
1.4. Pro: Historically feminism evolved out of Christianity, rooted in the basic concept of the equality of all people.
1.4.1. Con: Feminism did not evolve out of Christianity. There are records of [Native American and African matriarchies prior to the introduction of Christianity](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-25-vw-60506-story.html).
1.4.1.1. Con: Feminism is the struggle to get equality between men and women. It could only evolve where there was inequality.
1.4.1.2. Con: Feminism [had roots in Medieval Europe and the Rennaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protofeminism), which were heavily Christian cultures.
1.4.2. Con: Christian colonizers demolished and converted many more egalitarian/matriarchal societies \(such as the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi)\), leaving behind much more patriarchal societies.
1.4.3. Pro: Christianity is compatible with feminism by its definition, not by how it is displayed in our society today.
1.4.3.1. Con: God's actions are antithetical to the feminist position. In the same book of Genesis, God uses magic to increase the suffering of females while forcing them to obey their husbands \([Genesis 3:16](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm)\).
1.4.3.1.1. Con: This is something that is presented as not being God's plan for the woman \(inbetween curses against the serpent and a curse on the ground against man, [Gn 3:14–17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gn+3%3A14-17&version=NRSV)\), but something that comes from sin. And Christianity is about being freed from sin by Jesus \([Rm 6:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rm+6%3A22&version=NRSV)\).
1.4.3.2. Pro: Feminism's [definition](https://www.lexico.com/definition/feminism) is the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. Compared to this, [Genesis 1:27](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/1/Genesis-1-27.html) says, "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." This is saying men and women were created equal.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Equal images does not imply equality in the feminist sense, which means, among other things, equal opportunities, equal pay, equal treatment by the law, and so forth.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Yet no where in the Bible are we commanded to deny women opportunity, except [by Paul](https://learn.gcs.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=4261&chapterid=13)(1 Tim. 2:11-12 says: “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.” We will begin with a few observations about these verses, noting areas in which we need further clarification:\n\n1\) Paul did not believe that “a woman…must be silent” at all times. He says that women can pray and prophesy in a worship service \(1 Cor. 11\). There may be a difference between prophecy, which Paul allowed, and teaching, which he did not—or a special situation in Ephesus may have called for silence.\n\n2\) The Bible does not teach that females can never have authority over males. Scripture allows women to have civil authority over men,\[2\] and to have authority over male children, male teenagers, and possibly others. Again, we must find out what situation Paul was dealing with, and whether it applies to the church today.) who states it is his own personal opinion that women are to remain silent in church. No where in the Bible does God deny women's rights, only men deny women's rights. Christianity is based on the teachings of what God says, not what man does.
1.4.4. Pro: Paul says in [1Co 7:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1co+7%3A4&version=NRSV) that "likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does", a notion that was still outlandish during most of the 20th century.
1.4.4.1. Con: In that [very same epistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle_and_women), he commands women to be silent, and never to teach. That chapter of the epistle also says that a wife doesn't have authority over her own body, because it is her husband's. Paul is decidedly anti-feminist.
1.4.5. Pro: Christianity directly supports [equal value of women and men](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11-12), while asserting exalting contributions and duties [unique to each](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&old=true).
1.4.5.1. Con: "Equal value" is meaningless if women are assigned "duties" of their own.
1.4.6. Pro: [Gal 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A28&version=NIV) states, "there is neither Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free, male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
1.4.6.1. Con: Verses like Galatians 3:28 contradict other verses authored by the same apostle, Paul. In [1 Timothy 2:12](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-12.htm), for example, he writes, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet."
1.4.7. Con: Christianity is not the progenitor of the concept of equality, and in fact is one of its worst proponents.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.6. Pro: The fact that [Christianity says to do unto others as you would have them do unto you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_7:12) is compatible with treating all people with equality. This is what feminism is all about.
1.6.1. Con: The "[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Ancient_Egypt)" \(the principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated\) which is often attributed to Christianity, is actually far older.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Just because the idea is older than the religion does not mean it is not a part of that religion.
1.6.2. Con: The Bible teaches many things that it does not, nor do the churches of Christianity, actually go on to practise. As a majority of Christian history is definitely not feminist, including a vast majority of Christians and churches to this day being anti-feminist in doctrine and practice, Christianity is very plainly not feminist and never has been.
1.6.3. Con: Multiple sources in the Christian bible appear to contradict this view. Genesis 3:16, Colossians 3:18 , 1 Corinthians 11:3-10, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, Deuteronomy 21:11-14 , Deuteronomy 22:5 Timothy 2:9-15 , Ephesians 5:22-24 and Peter 3:1-6 to name a few.
1.6.4. Con: Doing to others what you want them to do to you is a dangerous moral code \(e.g. a masochist would harm others\) that in no way supports feminism - it instead allows men to claim that if they were women, they would want to be ruled by men \(for whatever sexist reasons\).
1.6.5. Con: The Bible has many exceptions to this rule, including when it is morally just to kill people.
1.6.6. Pro: According to the Oxford dictionary, the [definition of feminism](https://www.fastcompany.com/90404656/this-is-why-feminism-needs-to-be-the-future) is "the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes." The [definition of Christianity](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095610483) is "the religion based on the person and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, or its beliefs and practices". Jesus supported equality of men and women, and so it follows that Christianity is compatible with feminism.
1.6.6.1. Pro: All instances of [Jesus Interacting with women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus%27_interactions_with_women) tend to show that he was a feminist.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: All instances of Jesus interacting with women show that he loved them as children in the image of God. To say that Jesus was a feminist is misleading because Christian doctrine is [complementarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism), not [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_egalitarianism).
1.6.6.2. Pro: There are many areas of the Bible that involve [sexist ideas](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_sexism), but the Bible is also full of strong independent women who, especially in that era, stood up for themselves and introduced feminist ideas \(women such as [Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_\(biblical_figure\)), [Naomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_\(biblical_figure\)), [Jesus's mother Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus), [Mary Magdalene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene), and even though she was awful, [Jezebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel)\).
1.6.6.3. Pro: Christianity is based on the teachings of Jesus. Although the Bible has a lot to offer in terms of religious guidance, \(many of the Psalms are uplifting and bring comfort in dark times\) it is not the sole basis of Christianity.
1.6.6.4. Pro: When Jesus went up to heaven many women came to be the first evangelical Christians. And came out to teach others and prophesy. There are some pretty strong and courageous women in the bible. [mylordkatie.wordpress.com](https://mylordkatie.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/early-women-disciples-in-acts-part-1/)
1.6.6.5. Con: People may mistakenly take certain female characters in Bible and equality in belief to be aligning with feminism. However, for most parts, Bible goes against what feminism believe in. Women in Bible never had same rights as men. Also, women characters portrayed as "strong/independent" is yet still depended on men by the end. Christianity grants grace/eternity to all people who believe in God, but does not record that they have same rights as human on earth. \([Learn Religions](https://www.learnreligions.com/influential-women-of-the-bible-4023025)\) \([vision.org](https://www.vision.org/bible-anti-woman-318)\)
1.6.6.6. Pro: Feminism is about freedom from male power over women and is not only compatible, but key, to Jesus's teachings as he is highly anti-power.
1.6.6.6.1. Pro: Christianity is centered around the teaching and calling of Jesus, by placing him as the most important source of knowledge. Jesus' teachings are to be assumed to be supreme above others in the Bible. This trumps the Old Testament's subjugating statements on women.
1.6.6.6.2. Pro: Mary Baker Eddy [wrote](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Science_and_Health_with_Key_to_the_Scriptures_\(1906\)/04_Christian_Science_versus_Spiritualism), "God is Divine Spirit, and man, the whole man, the male and the female of Spirit's creating, is not defined by gender, class, upbringing or nationality, but is spiritual."
1.6.6.6.3. Pro: There are a wide range of passages in the Bible that clearly encourage gender equality \([Gen 1.27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=NIV) and [Gal. 3.28](http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm)\).
1.6.6.6.3.1. Pro: Paul wrote in [Galatians 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A28&version=NIV), "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
1.6.6.6.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.6.6.6.3.3. Pro: Christ himself was [funded and followed](https://apnews.com/5202d49371294451acfed0d760d3fd30/Correction:-Israel-Mary-Magdalene-story) by strong, financially independent female backers such as Mary Magdalene who had chosen that life. The fact they have mention, in name in several cases, including Mary, is relevant. Christianity is modeled by its namesake and those who follow should by definition acknowledge female agency.
1.6.6.6.3.3.1. Pro: Though the disciples \(his twelve best friends/students\) followed Jesus regularly, they also mention the [women who formed the group](http://www.crivoice.org/WT-apostle.html) and were also a part the mission.
1.6.6.6.4. Con: The true core message of the Christian and all of the Judeo faiths is to always give glory to God. Social justice is virtually irrelevant.
1.6.6.6.4.1. Pro: The primary Christian text also calls for [women](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV) to be [submissive to men](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-7&version=NIV) repeatedly from it's inception and goes out of it's way to [ensure](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A16&version=NIV) women [do not speak](https://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/historian-looks-1-timothy-211-14) in public or teach anything.
1.6.6.6.4.1.1. Con: The idea of woman's submission to man is misunderstood. Christian teaching is not that of a master/slave relationship between a husband and wife. The[relationship between a man and his wife](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A25-33&version=ESV) is to reflect the model of [Christ&Church](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A25-33&version=ESV). Christ's sacrificial love for the church, complemented by the church's willing submission to Christ's leadership, is the model of leadership in marriage.
1.6.6.6.4.1.1.1. Con: This is not compatible with feminism.
1.6.6.6.4.2. Pro: It [encourages](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A11-3%3A9&version=NIV) [slavery](https://www.bibledingers.com/post/wvw-does-the-bible-support-slavery-leviticus-25-44-46) even from Jesus himself let alone other New testament and Old Testament authors.
1.6.6.6.4.3. Con: The core message of Christian teaching is Christ's summary of "the Law": "Love God with your whole heart, and love your neighbor as yourself". Feminism falls under loving your neighbor as yourself, and Christian faith is perfected in Feminism.
1.6.6.6.4.3.1. Con: When women stop facing persecution because of Christian doctrine, dogma and textual interpretations the argument of reduction above may carry weight. Chrsitianity is much more than a few little rules and words of wisdom.
1.6.6.6.5. Pro: Christianity is feminism because Christianity honors women, such as the Virgin Mary. If Christianity followed the original will, the head of the church would always be a woman. Christianity values woman as essential to society. [calvary.edu](https://www.calvary.edu/christianity-true-feminism/); [religionnews.com](https://religionnews.com/2017/04/06/how-feminists-have-failed-christian-women/); If anything is true, feminism has failed Christian women with lies and assumptions.
1.6.6.6.6. Con: Feminism is not about ''freedom from male power over women''. [Feminism](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/feminism) is about the equal rights between men and women.
1.6.6.6.7. Pro: Christianity is defined as being "[Christ like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians)": Christ, on earth accepted women as equals in His dealings with them, including bringing them in to his inner circle.
1.6.6.6.7.1. Pro: The core message of Christian faith is one of [social justice and liberation for all](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230374447_6). A world where the least in society are given preference. Where the stranger is welcome, enemies are welcome, and the powerless, the poor and the sinner are welcome. You can't read Jesus' teachings without that.
1.6.6.6.7.2. Pro: Christ did indeed help [sinful women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus%27_interactions_with_women), but they repented and with the incident of the woman condemned to stoning, He told her to sin no more.
1.6.6.6.7.2.1. Pro: Jesus was also a feminist, essentially - he didn't care that [Mary Magdelan](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-mary-magdalene-119565482/) was a prostitute, or that she had 'fallen'. He redeemed her and many Christians believe that she was the one referred to in the Bible as 'the beloved disciple'.
1.6.6.6.7.2.1.1. Con: A feminist wouldn't "redeem" a prostitute, as feminism would see nothing wrong on the part of the disadvantaged woman. Rather a feminist would likely encourage safe, consensual and regulated sex work.
1.6.6.6.7.3. Con: Although some teachings indicate this, the overall message is perverted into one of anti-feminism. God and Jesus are one, therefore Jesus agrees to the teachings \(of God\) that women may not speak, or teach over men, they must submit, can be bought and sold by family and anyone who owns them.
1.6.6.6.7.3.1. Con: Christianity is, first and foremost, adherence to Christ Himself, not to the church who claims adherence to Christ. If a message is perverted, the condemnation falls to the one who perverted the message, not to the one who gave it.
1.6.6.6.7.4. Pro: When Jesus rose from the dead, He first [trusted women](https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2014/women-of-the-resurrection) \(whose word held no weight in court\) to spread the news of His resurrection, rather than sending men in order to give the miraculous claim more credibility.
1.7. Pro: Women always had a central role in Christianity. The fact that they don't cover the same roles as men doesn't mean that they have a less important role.
1.7.1. Pro: [Virgin Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus), the central figure in Christianity, was asked by God for permission to [realize His plans](https://answersingenesis.org/jesus/did-mary-know-what-was-to-come/).
1.7.1.1. Con: If feminism has concluded that a corporate [power imbalance nullifies consent](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018-12/power_dynamics_Final508.pdf), the divine power imbalance between Mary and God makes the issue of consent comically moot.
1.7.2. Pro: In God's eyes, each individual is different from another. Independently from the gender, each one could find sense in their life if they recognize their functions. In this regard, not only is Christianity is compatible with feminism, it is also compatible with humanity in general.
1.7.2.1. Con: Sense is found in life by recognising \(and following\) [the functions prescribed to men and women across gendered lines](https://www.gotquestions.org/complementarianism-vs-egalitarianism.html). The suggestion that individual uniqueness means that gendered roles no longer exist is not only illogical, but totally wrong according to Christian teaching.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Paul was clear that it was [his personal opinion](https://learn.gcs.edu/mod/book/view.php?id=4261&chapterid=13)(1\) Paul did not believe that “a woman…must be silent” at all times. He says that women can pray and prophesy in a worship service \(1 Cor. 11\). There may be a difference between prophecy, which Paul allowed, and teaching, which he did not—or a special situation in Ephesus may have called for silence.\n\n2\) The Bible does not teach that females can never have authority over males. Scripture allows women to have civil authority over men,\[2\] and to have authority over male children, male teenagers, and possibly others. Again, we must find out what situation Paul was dealing with, and whether it applies to the church today.\n\n3\) When Paul says, “I do not permit…,” he is stating his policy for churches in his jurisdiction. This may imply that all churches in subsequent centuries should have a similar policy—or it may not.), and not necessarily that of God. Paul said "*I* would have it that women remain silent in church." Paul did not say "God would have it..."
1.7.3. Con: Women may have had roles of some sorts, but they have been consistently denied leadership roles in churches, and even votes in church leadership. No matter the role women have played in Christianity, they have been disenfranchised. In fact, one could reasonably interpret feminism itself as a response to the disempowerment of women at the hands of Christianity.
1.7.4. Con: Just because something is in the "center" of something, doesnt mean they have any power.
1.7.5. Con: Relative importance isn't the principle concern of feminism; equality is. The fact that women don't cover the same roles as men absolutely indicates an inherent inequality.
1.7.5.1. Con: Women do not cover the same roles of men because men wish it this way, not God. Saying something is right because they is the way it is is faulty logic, akin to saying we should not cure cancer because people have always died from cancer.
1.8. Con: Women are barred from attaining positions of authority. [\[1\]](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2018/06/pope-reaffirms-women-cant-be-priests-says-church-has-woken-up-on-sex-abuse/)
1.8.1. Pro: Because of Eve, we [can't preach or do certain things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Timothy_2:12) that men can do because Eve was deceived and deceived Adam.
1.8.1.1. Con: [According to the Bible, Eve came from the ribs of Adam](https://www.gotquestions.org/Adams-rib.html), therefore being a women was already limiting even before Eve was deceived.
1.8.2. Pro: Women are not allowed to [become pastors](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+14%3A32-35&version=KJV).
1.8.3. Con: The most respected person under the Orthodox Church is [The Holy Virgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus).
1.8.4. Con: In Christianity, there are female prophets such as [Miriam](https://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/priscilla-papers-academic-journal/women-prophets-old-testament), Moses' sister.
1.8.5. Pro: Catholics [religious women can only become nuns](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/why-cant-women-be-priests), while catholic religious men can become priests and even the Pope.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Women can't become the Pope because because the person chosen for the position would have to be ordained, [however women are barred from becoming priests](https://www.livescience.com/27751-why-women-cant-be-pope.html).
1.9. Con: The Bible does not consider men and women as equals.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.9.2. Pro: To be a true feminist, you have to stand up for all women including lesbian women. The Bible [condemns lesbian women](https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-homosexuality), and therefore is not feminist.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The Bible's stance on transgender individuals is also broadly supported by many Christians; as such, it is not feminist.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Sub-sets of feminism condemn certain types of [transgenderism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_feminism#Views_on_transgender_topics)
1.9.2.1.2. Con: If we take Christianity to mean the teachings of Christ then the words of Christ speak of love primarily. We can assume that his actions \(proclaimed in the Bible as a guiding principal\) ought to be the authority of the faith system. Addressing transgenderism, he went into the homes of people not accepted by the larger religious society, made friends, without judging or asking for conversion.
1.9.2.1.3. Pro: The Bible has much to say about the conduct of men as opposed to women \([Titus 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2&version=NIV), [Corinthians 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11&version=NIV)\). It says that men and women need to dress according to their sex \([Duet 22:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A5&version=KJV)\). Transgenderism is thus not compatible from a Biblical or Christian perspective.
1.9.2.1.3.1. Con: Transgenderism has only really been recognised in the last century or so. [Many Christians now support LGBT+ people](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/18/most-u-s-christian-groups-grow-more-accepting-of-homosexuality/), as they don't take everything in the Bible completely literally.
1.9.2.1.3.2. Con: One can be transgender and Christian. Talking about how the Old Testament discriminates against transgender people shows a problem with Judaism, as [Jewish people are the ones that follow the Old Testament](https://time.com/5606942/jewish-christian-bible/), not Christians.
1.9.2.1.3.3. Con: The Bible was write by different people with their own thoughts about what Christianity is, that is subjective. When we analyze Jesus Christ and his deeds, that is objective and the real Christianity. We should separate the subjective Christianity from the objective Christianity.
1.9.2.2. Con: Technically, the Bible doesn't condemn lesbians - only homosexual men. One should still not persecute homosexuality, but technically, the Bible is fine with homosexual women.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: Christianity being against homosexuality comes from the fact that the Son of God was the one speaking to Adam and Eve. In [John 5:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A37&version=NIV), Christ says that no one has heard the Father. We also see in [John 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NIV) that Christ is the Word of God. The Son was the One who defined marriage to be only between man and woman with the woman having the lower role in Genesis.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: Lesbianism is described in the Bible, and condemned as a sin. It doesn't make sense that the Bible would be okay with homosexual women, and not okay with homosexual men.
1.9.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Romans 1:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A26-27&version=NIV) states, "For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were."
1.9.2.2.2.1.1. Con: All this passage says is that their relations were "contrary to nature," which is unclear and could be a reference to bestiality, pedophilia, or any number of other acts. Only in verse 27 is \(male\) homosexuality clearly described.
1.9.2.2.3. Pro: [Leviticus 20:13](https://www.biblestudytools.com/leviticus/20-13-compare.html) sates, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act."
1.9.2.2.4. Con: If the Bible condemns male homosexuality, it would stand to reason it would also be against female homosexuality, as there is no relevant difference between them, with respect to the condemnation.
1.9.2.2.5. Con: If feminism is defined as equality of men and women \(as it is in this debate\), then this argument is a distinction without a difference; it actually supports the idea of Christian/feminist incompatibility while trying to defend against it.
1.9.2.3. Con: Feminists are not required to stand up for all women at all times.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Feminists can readily condemn women guilty of crimes or evil acts. If one believes in sin, and that homosexuality is a sin, it's consistent for a Christian feminist to condemn a lesbian the same way a secular feminist might condemn a female criminal.
1.9.2.4. Pro: Marriage is defined as between man and woman, with the woman taking a submissive role. All sexual relations outside of marriage are also not allowed. Christ both defined marriage this way, and did not allow sexual relations outside of marriage.
1.9.2.5. Con: Condemning actions is not equivalent to condemning people. The Bible condemns homosexual acts, but it does not condemn people who have a desire they cannot control: it merely advises them not to pursue that desire.
1.9.2.5.1. Con: To say that an act is condemned is a mere figure of speech - a metonymy. What is meant is that the person is condemned.
1.9.2.6. Con: A person can be a feminist and not "stand up" for women who commit criminal acts.
1.9.2.7. Con: The Bible says that everyone is equal, no matter what sins they have committed. Just because the Bible states that committing homosexual actions is a sin does not mean that the Bible doesn't also state that everyone regardless of gender, sexuality, religion, or race and should be treated equally.
1.9.3. Con: The Bible notes women used by God to carry out his purpose, showing that God himself views men and women as equals.
1.9.3.1. Pro: In [Judges 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%204%3A4&version=NIV), Deborah acts as a prophet for Israel.
1.9.4. Con: As it says in [Galatians 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A28&version=ESV), there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. This means that men and women are equal in the eyes of God.
1.9.4.1. Con: If women were equal in the eyes of God, Biblical teachings would not instruct wives to be "subject to their husbands". \([Titus 2:3-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202%3A3-5&version=NIV)\)
1.9.4.1.1. Con: No longer having unique and different positions in society does not follow from being considered of equal value.
