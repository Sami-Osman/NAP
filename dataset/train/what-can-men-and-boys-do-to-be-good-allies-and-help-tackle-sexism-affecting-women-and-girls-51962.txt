1. What can men and boys do to be good allies and help tackle sexism affecting women and girls?
1.1. By treating women better.
1.1.1. Pro: Both men and boys must demonstrate the most important trait of all: respect.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The desire to be respected is a [basic human need](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/esteem-maslow-s-hierarchy-of-needs). Boys and men who do not respect girls and women deprive women of this fundamental need.
1.1.1.2. Con: It is difficult to determine when one respects or disrespects another person. For example, a compliment may be perceived as respectful by the sender of the message, but not by the receiver of the message.
1.1.2. Con: By empowering women financially
1.1.2.1. Con: On average, women are [hypergamous](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a32743030/what-is-hypergamy/). Improved financial status for women may increase the pressure men face when finding a mate.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Men already find it very difficult to [find suitable mates](https://thebolditalic.com/the-two-worlds-of-tinder-f1c34e800db4) on dating platforms like Tinder. A higher financial status for women would exacerbate this crisis.
1.1.3. Pro: Boys and men can be better allies by [listening](https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-men-can-become-better-allies-to-women) to the girls and women in their lives
1.1.3.1. Pro: Listening to women [empowers](https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-men-can-become-better-allies-to-women)(Consultant Chuck Shelton reminds men that listening to women’s voices in a way that inspires trust and respect is a fundamental relationship promise you must make, and then keep, with women who invite you to participate around equity. Generous, world-class listening requires focus, sincerity, empathy, refusal to interrupt, and genuine valuing of both her experience and her willingness to share it with you.) them because it lets them know what their voices are heard and that their viewpoints are worth paying attention to.
1.1.3.2. Pro: It is common for men to interrupt women and "[mansplain](https://scroll.in/article/948195/to-shut-down-mansplaining-we-need-to-change-how-we-talk-about-it)(Studies show that in meetings, men speak more, and more powerful men speak even more. Men interrupt more, and are less likely than women to cede the floor when they are interrupted. Women worry, correctly, that if they fight to get their voices heard, they will experience backlash.)" issues, including women's issues, to women. To change this image - that they know better - men must actively try to be better listeners to women.
1.1.4. Pro: By ensuring that women get credit for the work they do
1.1.4.1. Pro: Women are [less likely to receive credit](https://hbr.org/2016/02/proof-that-women-get-less-credit-for-teamwork) for the work that they do. By speaking up and acknowledging their contributions, men can be good allies to women.
1.2. By advocating for government-level changes.
1.2.1. Pro: Sexism can be tackled through supporting legislative change to level the playing field
1.2.1.1. Con: Other than once every four years or so at a general election, most men are not in a position to drive through legislative change.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Men, by virtue of their privilege, are more likely to be in positions of power such as in government and as employers and managers. Using their privilege to dismantle it is important both materially and symbolically.
1.2.1.3. Con: In many liberal democracies, gender equality rights are often already codified in law. It is everyday sexism that holds women and girls back.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The UK's [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) protects girls and women from discrimination.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Taking positive steps to increase the representation of women and minorities in areas of employment, education, and culture from which they have been historically excluded would benefit everyone
1.2.1.5. Con: Legislation such as [gender quotas](https://environmental-conscience.com/gender-quotas-pros-cons/) in business pose a number of potential problems for both women and men.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Instead of doing justice, preferential treatment might violate rights, e.g.: in the job sphere it might violate the right of an applicant “to equal consideration”, the right of the maximally competent to an open position, or the right of everyone to equal opportunity
1.2.1.5.2. Con: In a context of entrenched gender discrimination, gender preferences might improve the “overall fairness” of job selections.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: [If individual men’s careers are temporarily set back because of…\[job preferences given to women\], the odds are good that these same men will have benefited in the past and/or will benefit in the future—not necessarily in the job competition, but in some ways—from sexist discrimination against women. Conversely, if individual women receive apparently unearned bonuses, it is highly likely that these same women will have suffered in the past and/or will suffer in the future from…sexist attitudes.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/)(Warren, Mary Anne, 1977, “Secondary Sexism and Quota Hiring,” Philosophy & Public Affairs, 6 \(Spring\): 256.)
1.2.2. Pro: Sexism can be tackled by helping to lobby the government on issues which have a disproportionate effect on women and girls
1.2.2.1. Pro: The safety of women in public spaces is a political issue and can be solved through government policies
1.2.3. Pro: Sexism can be tackled through attending peaceful protests
1.2.3.1. Pro: If more sympathetic men were visibly supportive, it would reduce the us versus them mentality
1.2.3.2. Con: Protests are one-time events, usually only lasting a few hours. Change requires concerted, long-term effort.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Protests can be over time and can have the effect of bringing about a change in laws or government policies, which have long-term effects. For peaceful means of social change to be effective, they must be coordinated and organized, and the power of nonviolence is linked to its ability to motivate and move large numbers of people. It requires a coordinated social effort.
1.3. By making real-world and offline spaces less misogynistic.
1.3.1. Pro: Men should actively help women with tackling online sprawling involuntary celibate communities
1.3.1.1. Con: "Tackling" incel communities would only draw more attention to such communities. Depriving them of any attention would be more effective in making such communities go extinct.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Experts are warning that a dangerous online subculture known as the “incel” movement is gaining traction. Laura Bates, who researched incel culture while researching her book Men Who Hate Women, argues “[they see women as completely commodified and dehumanised sex objects \[that\] are there purely for male sexual pleasure. And they blame women for the fact that they’re not having sex](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/13/plymouth-shootings-may-be-a-sign-the-incel-culture-is-spreading).”
1.3.1.3. Pro: There is evidence that this is now a [counter terrorist issue](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/police-urged-to-clamp-down-on-incel-movement-after-plymouth-shooting-0nppjxhj8). In the 2010s, there's been a huge and growing backlash from young men who have been radicalised online - this sense that feminism is a vast conspiracy; man-hating smuggled into the public sphere. It's a form of grooming, but we don't label it that.
1.3.1.4. Con: Men trying to help women tackle these issues would reinforce the notion that women are damsels in distress who need rescuing.
1.3.2. Pro: By tackling objectifying discourse in single gender spaces, which allows sexism to mature.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Locker room talk can ignore the agency of women and treat them as interchangeable like other objects.
1.3.3. Pro: Men and boys can practice zero tolerance to sexism amongst peers.
1.3.3.1. Con: Some girls and women may interpret a man's zero tolerance towards sexism as paternalistic, implying that they cannot defend themselves.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Tackling sexism is not just about how men treat women and girls directly, but how they speak about them when they're not present. Men and boys are uniquely placed to address this.
1.3.3.3. Con: Regardless of what they can do, men and boys are unlikely to practice zero tolerance, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly hostile reaction [Gillette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Men_Can_Be) faced in response to their advertisement showing that men and boys can help fight against sexual harassment.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Boys and men should do what is right on ethicomoral grounds, regardless of the consequences.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: Courage is typically considered a sign of [masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity). Standing up to male peers would be a demonstration of such courage, whereas compliance would indicate timidity.
1.4. By increasing awareness about gender inequality through various mediums.
1.4.1. Pro: Sexism can be tackled through education on the situation of women and the ideal of equality
1.4.1.1. Pro: Teaching about women's experiences in public places can activate empathy
1.4.2. Pro: Sexism needs to be talked about in discourse more as a problem to be solved.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Sexism is an invisible problem which needs to be made visible.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Usually the only witnesses are the victim and perpetrator.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Any flagging of the problem is met with denial, accusations of lying, or exxageration to maintain comfortable states of ignorance.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: It is difficult for men to speak up In the same way as it is for other women because they are heavily outnumbered and risk being ostracised from the social group.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: If they don't speak up, women bear the brunt of the consequences.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: There are regular occurrences that hide in plain sight within a society that has normalised sexism and allowed it to become so ingrained that we no longer notice or object to it.
1.4.2.1.5. Pro: Women are [silenced both by the invisibility and the acceptability of the problem](http://worldcat.org/title/everyday-sexism/oclc/1098181560&referer=brief_results#reviews)(One woman from the Everyday Sexism project said "It's amazing that many of us feel so resigned to something which if directed at any other group of people would be considered very offensive." Bates, Laura. 2016. Everyday sexism.).
1.4.2.1.5.1. Pro: The most powerful evidence of all for the public acceptance of sexism is the ever-growing number of major daytime television programmes taking issues around women's safety and assault as topics for 'debate'. [The very fact that it is necessary in 2013 to explain why it's not OK to publicly debate whether or not women are 'asking' for sexual assault is mindboggling](http://worldcat.org/title/everyday-sexism/oclc/1098181560&referer=brief_results#reviews)(In February 2013 the ITV morning show Daybreak, with an average of 800,000 viewers, ran a segment asking 'Are women who get drunk and flirt to blame if they get attacked?' The discussion was introduced with: 'Some of you think so others vehemently disagree. ' Then: 'Keep your thoughts coming in — it's really interesting to hear what you think.' The words 'horrifying', 'depressing' or 'painful' would have better described what it was actually like to hear what some of the Daybreak viewers thought. Comments were aired from interviewees on both sides of the debate, including one young man who said that 'if you want to be treated with respect, you’ve got to dress with\nrespect’ and a studio panellist who – when discussing sexual assault!\n– used the phrase ‘It takes two to make a decision about something’.).
1.4.2.1.6. Con: Sexism is not invisible; instead, it is very much visible, but people refuse to acknowledge that they see it. Thus, more visibility may not necessarily translate into reduced sexism.
1.4.2.1.6.1. Pro: It is hard to make people talk about it because people don't want to be the one to admit they see it if everyone is pretends not to.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Sexism is a socially acceptable prejudice in public discourse and everyone has some responsibility to combat it. Active effort is needed to work against sexism being normalised.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Women regularly get judged for their looks rather than their abilities, which is an additional pressure not faced by men to nearly the same extent.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Women regularly [get belittled about unevidenced limits to their ability](https://www.worldcat.org/title/everyday-sexism/oclc/1098181560&referer=brief_results)(Meanwhile London Mayor Boris Johnson 'joked' that women only go to university because 'they've got to find men to marry' \(hilarious, no?\) and the Canadian literature professor and author David Gilmour blithely revealed that he's simply 'not interested in teaching books by women'. In November 2012 Labour MP Austin Mitchell directed a sexist tirade at his former colleague Louise Mensch after she disagreed in an interview with something her husband had said. In a message that appeared on his Facebook and Twitter pages as well as his official website, Mitchell wrote: 'Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn't lie about why she quit politics.' ...Clearly none of these men feared repercussions. Bates, Laura. 2016. Everyday sexism.).
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: There is sometimes an [intersectionality](https://www.worldcat.org/title/everyday-sexism/oclc/1098181560&referer=brief_results#reviews)(Against such a backdrop it's little wonder other politicians feel so confident wearing their bigotry like a badge of honour. From highbrow to lowbrow these attitudes are rife across the board of celebrity. In the same week as Mitchell's outburst, and with the earnest air of a Radio 4 consumer phone-in about synthetic versus feather duvets, BBC Radio Cumbria produced a segment that cleverly managed to combine both sexism and racism, asking: 'If you could have a Filipino woman, why would you want a Cumbrian one?' Bates, Laura. 2016. Everyday sexism.) between sexism and other prejudices which cannot be disentangled.
1.4.2.3. Con: Talking about sexism as a problem to be solved could position women as victims, thereby exacerbating their sense of helplessness in a deeply patriarchal society.
1.4.3. Pro: Sexism can be tackled through the arts
1.4.3.1. Pro: The arts can use their persuasive power to tap into people's emotions and question oppressive regimes
1.4.3.2. Pro: The arts can promote empathy and highlight systemic problems
1.4.3.3. Con: [The arts](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/24/799163534/gender-bias-reveals-consequences-for-female-artists) have not been very kind to women. Therefore, it is unlikely that the [same medium](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/we-asked-20-women-is-the-art-world-biased-heres-what-they-said-81162) can be used by men to be better allies to women.
1.5. By leaving women alone and focusing on their personal growth.
1.5.1. Con: If men solely focus on the personal rather than the interpersonal, then they likely will not be as aware of the unintentional, everyday derogatory messages they may direct towards women as a group.
1.5.1.1. Con: Group identity wouldn't be consider be as important as individual identity. Females that good individuals will improve the female group reputation identity same as bad females will tarnish female group reputation.
1.6. By working toward equal representation of women in high-risk and low reputation jobs
1.6.1. Pro: One example is that women make up a [low proportion](https://www.zippia.com/garbage-collector-jobs/demographics/) of garbage collectors.
1.6.2. Pro: High-risk and low reputation jobs may provide women incentives to become physically stronger and motivate people to get promoted to higher reputation jobs.
1.7. By creating safe and empowering classrooms for girls
