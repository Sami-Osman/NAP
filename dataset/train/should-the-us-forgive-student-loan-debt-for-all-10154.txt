Discussion Name: Should the US forgive student loan debt for all?

1. Student loan debt in the US should be forgiven for all.
1.1. Con: It seems unfair to those who have played by the rules and pay their debts to see others get debt forgiveness.
1.1.1. Pro: Forgiving these loans would create a "moral hazard": people will be more likely to take on bigger loans \(for more expensive schools\), and incur bigger debt burdens, if they expect the government to intervene.
1.1.2. Con: Those that have already paid their debts are likely to pertain to [higher economic classes](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/13/facts-about-student-loans/), meaning they could afford to do so. The injustice is therefore lessened.
1.1.3. Con: Implementing a new policy is not unfair to those who didn't benefit beforehand. Making a cure to cancer public is not unfair to those who couldn't be cured beforehand.
1.2. Pro: Forgiving student loan debt will encourage more people to attend university, thereby generating a more well-trained population.
1.2.1. Con: It is not clear that the majority of graduates exit the universities being “well-trained” if “well trained” is defined as “being valuable members of society”.
1.2.2. Con: It is a false dilemma to suppose that university is the only option for receiving better training. For example, a philosophy degree is not better trained for carpentry then a 2-year carpentry apprentice.
1.2.3. Con: If we wind up with more graduates, the resulting population may not fit our job market as [not every job requires a college degree](https://www.home-school.com/Articles/not-all-good-jobs-require-a-bachelors-degree.php). Having people with bachelor's degrees flip burgers helps no one.
1.3. Pro: Forgiving student loan debt would [boost the country's economy](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/25/782070151/forgiving-student-debt-would-boost-economy).
1.3.1. Con: The loan amnesty has [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost); there's more efficient ways to use the money for the economy.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The losses incurred by the banks issuing the loans would have negative repercussions for the banks' [ability to lend](https://www.cairn.info/revue-economie-internationale-2012-4-page-91.htm) in the future.
1.3.2. Pro: Additional capital saved up by students could be pumped back into the economy through expenditures, rather than repayments.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The speediest way to revive our economy is enact a policy to help consumers in a very real way. When working people have more money, they spend it.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: This would only help a small percentage of the population.    Impact would, thus, be limited.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Positive impacts would be offset by the higher taxes required to pay for the debts.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Forgiving student debt will raise [Americans' taxes](https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/student-debt-taxes).
1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Given it is only those who attended university who benefit economically from their education, it is unfair to spread that cost across the whole of society.
1.3.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: A more educated workforce has society-wide benefits.
1.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: US government spending has many pockets to tap into instead of raising taxes.
1.3.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Americans are seemingly happy to pay high taxes to keep their troops stationed in distant places. Taxes in themselves don't seem to be the problem.
1.3.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Many Americans \([~30% of those surveyed](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1666/military-national-defense.aspx)\) believe that America is spending too much on the military; this is not a valid counter example.
1.3.2.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Just because money is potentially wasted in one place does not mean more money should be wasted elsewhere.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4. Con: It is unnecessary for taxpayers to pay for student loan debt. Commerce has been pent-up by student loan debt. Forgiving student loan debt will likely result in [greater consumer spending](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_2_6.pdf), which is likely to increase incomes across the U.S. by increasing tax yields at the current rate.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Student debt is associated with [lower credit scores](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/do-student-loans-affect-your-credit/) which means less consumption on credit in the economy which means less income in aggregate.
1.3.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Student debt is associated with [decreases in small business creation](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2015/wp15-26.pdf). More small businesses could result in more jobs and thus more incomes.
1.3.2.2. Con: Repayments 'pump back' the money into the economy, namely the financial industry.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.4. Pro: Students with massive loan debts will struggle to be independent, productive members of society after they graduate.
1.3.5. Con: Forgiving student debt won't work. Those who see relief will likely incur sizable [tax liabilities](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4681.pdf~) \(just as distressed homeowners did\). In effect, many will exchange student loan payments for IRS repayment plans.
1.3.6. Pro: Forgiving student loans will help people be able to start up businesses, free up credit, and create new jobs.
1.3.6.1. Con: It may encourage/allow some spending, but it's unclear that it would create new jobs, especially since forgiving trillions in loans would almost certainly necessitate higher taxes which would have [negative economic effects](https://www.institutmolinari.org/2015/11/23/taxation-and-its-negative-impact-on-business-investment-activities/).
1.4. Con: Forgiving student loans won't address the underlying problem: colleges and universities charge more for some degrees than the graduates' earnings potential can support. Any solution should also hold academia financially accountable for this imbalance.
1.4.1. Pro: Only [51% of federal borrowers](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/19/us/student-loan-slow-repayment-moodys-trnd/index.html) who were scheduled to start paying back their loans in 2010 to 2012 had made any progress after five years in the US.
1.5. Con: It would be unfair to those that have chosen less prestigious universities in order to avoid large debt.
1.5.1. Pro: People at less prestigious universities are likely to earn less than those who attended the country's best universities.
1.6. Pro: All education should be free, and thus student loan should be forgiven for all.
1.6.1. Con: Education isn't free and never logically could be. Colleges provide education is a service, and the books and other resources are the goods, hence education isn't free and never logically could, as they must profit from the services that they provide.
1.6.2. Pro: Forgiving student loan debt would make for a more egalitarian society.
1.6.2.1. Pro: At present, the poor are more likely to be burdened by the cost of their student loan, a burden that they will carry for life.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Actually, people who make poor educational decisions are more likely to be burdened by the cost of their student loan. That is, people who opt for degrees with limited employability at expensive schools are far more likely to carry heavy debt.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: On the other hand, people who choose degrees that can readily lead to well-paying post-graduation jobs are far less likely to be overburdened by their debt.
1.6.2.2. Con: Those who are more educated are [likely to](https://theconversation.com/students-who-plan-to-seek-more-education-than-needed-for-their-career-earn-more-money-119149) earn more money, so removing their need to pay back for their education would make those more likely to become rich better off.
1.6.3. Pro: Student loans are an example of [predatory lending](http://www.financialaidfinder.com/the-dark-side-of-student-loans/) and the victims of such should not be compelled to continue to pay for their victimization.
1.6.3.1. Con: Student loan rates [compare](https://www.investopedia.com/current-student-loan-interest-rates-4770874) quite favorably to the loans most common to most Americans and can hardly be called predatory.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Average student loan interest rates are between [4.79% - 7.41%](https://www.credible.com/blog/refinance-student-loans/what-are-average-student-loan-interest-rates/), depending on the type of loan and you typically have 10 - 15 years to pay. Meanwhile the average mortgage loan is [4.1%](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/mortgages/heres-size-average-americans-mortgage/) for 15-30 years, car loan 4.2% for 3-6 years, and credit card 12.2% for any duration.
1.6.3.2. Con: Students knew the terms of their loans when they agreed to them.
1.6.3.3. Con: Such a move could produce a generation of irresponsible 'takers' and create a tidal wave of law suits for the reimbursement to those who had repaid their just and lawful debts.
1.6.4. Con: Free education would come at the cost of world-leading educational quality at the top universities.
1.6.5. Pro: If we can afford to award the rich bankruptcy up to four or six times, then we can afford to forgive a student's debt.
1.7. Con: Forgiving student debt is not fair to those who do not go on to higher education.
1.7.1. Pro: College education [is linked](https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2016/college-education-linked-to-hgher-pay-job-security-healthier-behaviors-and-more-civic-involvement) to higher pay and job security later in life. It is therefore only fair that those who benefited from this college education pay in order to receive these privileges.
1.7.1.1. Con: Relieving student loan debt frees up commerce, thus those who did not go on to higher education might receive more income.
1.7.2. Pro: Those without higher education would pay for those who receive higher education.
1.8. Con: People should have personal responsibility by repaying their student loans.
1.8.1. Pro: Given it was an individual choice to go to university, it should be the individual who pays for their choice.
1.8.1.1. Con: The [US government does have special loan forgiveness programs](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation) that absolve students in certain situations of their loan debt after a period of time. Often times these forgiveness programs are offered for low-paying jobs in public service and professions that often require specialized skills that require higher education. Examples of such professions include [social workers](https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=F8vbo7y8E70%3D&portalid=0), non-profit agency workers, and [public school teachers](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/07/16/536488351/teachers-with-student-debt-the-struggle-the-causes-and-what-comes-next).
1.8.2. Con: Even if one has accepted responsibility for a loan, it does not mean that it is wrong to absolve them of that responsibility in the future.
